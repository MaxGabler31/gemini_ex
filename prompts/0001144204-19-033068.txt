ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Overview
 
We specialize in the research, development, and manufacturing of oral care and cosmetic dentistry products.  We are one of the leading manufacturers of cosmetic dentistry products in Europe.  Leveraging our knowledge of regulatory requirements regarding dental products and management’s experience in the needs of the professional dental community, we design, develop, manufacture and distribute our cosmetic dentistry products, including a full line of professional dental products that are distributed in Europe, Asia, Middle East and the United States.
 
In 2006 we developed a revolutionary system for manufacturing and installing dental veneers which we branded as GlamSmile ® veneers revolutionize the traditional one-at-a-time method of applying porcelain dental veneers.  GlamSmile veneers are attached to the front of the patient’s teeth using a patent pending single motion placement tray which replaces the traditional one at a time trial and error method of applying porcelain veneers, making the application less traumatic for the patient, much easier for the dentist and perhaps most important, far less costly than traditional dental veneers. Currently, the GlamSmile veneers are our primary products in the professional oral care and cosmetic dentistry product.  Our products are sold to professionals by distributors and sold directly to consumers by our GlamSmile Studios.
 
Since January 2017, we have launched the ‘Condor” 3D Scanner for which we have the non-exclusive distribution rights for North America and Canada. “Condor” represents the next generation of intra-oral scanners at affordable prices for impressions and diagnostics. Rather than a laser, this new device uses stereoscopic visible light to create its 3D scan, making the entire system less costly, more power efficient, smaller, lighter and inherently safer than laser-based systems. Due to the open source system software, images and resulting crowns can be processed by any qualified lab, furthering flexibility for the dentist and lowering lab costs through the market.
 
Effective March 29, 2019, we acquired 26.09% of the issued and outstanding shares of Metrics in Balance N.V., post merge and integration of SmileWise Corporate B.V.B.A. into Metrics in Balance N.V. This integration made perfect sense, as SmileWise needed a new ‘practice-building’ clinical concept and Metrics in Balance needed a team to fill the clinics with patients. Metrics in Balance is a clinical concept that allows healthcare & dental professionals to diagnose the relationship between malocclusion and posture problems. SmileWise B.V.B.A. is a dental marketing agency and software developer catering to dentists, in particular, it offers services to dentist practices to boost their revenue by attracting new patients. It does so by offering a suite of software products and delivering consulting services such as dental marketing.
 
Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of Arizona in September 1996 under the name Remedent USA, Inc.  In October 1998, we were acquired by Resort World Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation in a share exchange, and we immediately changed our name to Remedent USA, Inc. and later to Remedent, Inc.
 
In the latter part of 2008, we separated our OTC business from our professional business, in order to focus on the development, marketing and distribution of our products for the professional dental market.  In December 2008, we completed a restructuring in the form of a management-led buyout of 50% of our OTC retail business (“2008 Restructuring”).  The buyout was led by Mr. Robin List, our former director and Chief Executive Officer, with financing provided by a non-affiliated foreign investment fund.  We effected our OTC restructuring through a series of transactions involving subsidiary formations, contributions of subsidiary(ies) interests and sales of stock interests through subsidiary transactions.  As a result of the series of transactions Remedent Inc. retained 50% of  Remedent OTC BV, a Dutch company (“Remedent OTC”) with Mr. List owning the other 50%. Remedent OTC owned and held a 75% ownership interest in Sylphar Holding BV, a Dutch holding company which owned and held the OTC operating subsidiaries  (“Sylphar Holding”), together with Concordia Fund B.V. who owned 25% of Sylphar Holding.  As a result of Remedent, Inc.’s ownership interest in Remedent OTC, Remedent, Inc. held an ownership interest equal to 37.5% interest in Sylphar Holding.   As a result, all of the OTC business previously directly operated by us was operated and held by Sylphar Holding. In addition, following the restructuring we have focused our business primarily on the marketing and distribution of our GlamSmile Veneers. Effective July 13, 2012 and as amended February 7, 2013 the Company sold 100% of its interest in Remedent OTC BV.
 
In January, 2010 we formed a joint venture with Gallant Network Limited (“Gallant”) to formalize our GlamSmile operations in China.   In order to sell our products into the Chinese market, an approval by Chinese authorities is required, in the form of licenses. Since GlamSmile Asia Ltd., a private Hong Kong company (“GlamSmile Asia”), was already the owner of such licenses prior to the acquisition, this was an important advantage.  We obtained control of GlamSmile Asia through the acquisition of a 50.98% interest in exchange for (i) 325,000 Euro (US $466,725), of which 50,000 Euro was payable as of March 31, 2010, (ii) 250,000 shares of common stock was originally agreed to be issued during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 and then subsequently amended to be issued during fiscal year ended March 31, 2016  and (iii) option grants of up to 300,000 shares of our common stock, of which 200,000 shares were granted as of March 31, 2011.

In addition, in connection with the contemplated transactions in the Share Purchase Agreement on January 20, 2012, we entered into a Distribution, License and Manufacturing Agreement with Glamsmile Dental pursuant to which we appointed Glamsmile Dental as the exclusive distributor and licensee of Glamsmile Veneer Products bearing the “Glamsmile” name and mark in the B2C Market in the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Republic of China (Taiwan) and granted related manufacturing rights and licenses in exchange for the original issuance of 2,857,143 shares of Preference A-1 Shares of Glamsmile Dental and $250,000 (the receipt of which was acknowledged as an off set to payment of certain invoices of Glamsmile (Asia) Limited).
 
On January 30, 2014, we sold a total of 2,500,000 ordinary shares of our investment in Glamsmile Dental Technology Ltd. for an aggregate consideration of $3,000,000 to Glamsmile Dental Technology Ltd. As a result of the sales of Shares, the equity ownership of Glamsmile Dental, on an as converted basis, was before the sale of shares as follows: 31.4% by the Investors, 39.2 % by Gallant, and 29.4% by the Company, and after the sale as follows: 34.9% by the Investors, 43.6% by Gallant, and 21.5% by the Company. Mr. De Vreese, our chairman, will remain as a director of Glamsmile Dental along with Mr. David Lok, who is the Chief Executive Officer and director of Glamsmile Dental and principal of Gallant.
 
On January 16, 2014, the Company invested in the start-up capital of Biotech Dental Benelux N.V., a Belgium corporation in exchange for 50% of its Shares. Biotech Dental Benelux has been founded to market and sell dental implants for the Territory of Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxemburg which allows the company to enlarge its product range.
 
On January 1, 2017, the Company invested in the start-up of Newco Condor North America, LLC, a Nevada corporation. Condor North America, LLC. was founded to market, distribute and sell the Condor intra-oral 3D scanner for the Territory of North America and Canada.
 
On March 29, 2019, the Company acquired 26.09% of the issued and outstanding shares of Metrics in Balance N.V., a Belgium corporation.

Past Product Development
 
We have been a manufacturer and distributor of cosmetic dentistry products, including a full line of professional dental and retail OTC tooth whitening products which are distributed in Europe, Asia, Middle East and the United States.  We have distributed our products using both our own internal sales force and through the use of third party distributors.  Prior to our 2008 restructuring, our products were generally classified into the following categories: professional dental products and OTC tooth whitening products. Our OTC division included products targeted for retail such as iWhite, Cleverwhite and Remesense. However as a result of the 2008 Restructuring and sale, all of our prior OTC operations, including the marketing and distribution of the OTC products are being conducted by Sylphar Holding and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  We developed the following products for our professional dental segment:

· | Remewhite in Office Whitening System . One of our first dental products that we developed for the professional dental community was the RemeCure™ plasma curing light (described below). Leveraging on our early success with the RemeCure light, we introduced the RemeWhite™ In Office Whitening System. Based upon the initial RemeCure light, a new light, called the RemeCure CL-15, was developed featuring new enhancements to the hardware and software enabling this light to be fully automated thereby eliminating the need for the dentist to hold the light during whitening treatments. In addition, a proprietary gel was formulated to be used with the system as well as a time saving method to apply the gel. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Remewhite Home Maintenance Kit . In 2004, the RemeWhite Home Maintenance Kit was introduced and sold by dentists to their patients, featuring 16 pre-filled trays with a level of whitening agent safe for home use yet stronger than most OTC products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Metatray . In August 2005, we introduced MetaTray®, our next generation of products targeted for the professional dentist market. The MetaTray kit consists of a proprietary, reusable mouthpiece that has embedded in the mouthpiece both a heating element and an electroluminescent mesh that are powered by a rechargeable 9 volt power source providing heat and light similar to that which is delivered to the teeth by conventional dental lights. The system also introduced a proprietary foam strip that is unique in the manner in which it releases peroxide to the tooth surface without dripping or running. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RemeCure. The RemeCure plasma curing light uses plasma arc technology instead of LED and laser technology which provides high-energy power over the complete spectrum.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FirstFit. We developed the FirstFit™ System, a proprietary, patent-pending system for the creation and placement of dental bridges and crowns. Effective as of March 29, 2010 the intellectual property used and related to FirstFit product was sold to Den-Mat Holdings LLC (“Den-Mat”).

Current Business Strategy
 
Our current business strategy is to focus our resources on vertically integrating our development, manufacturing and marketing resources on selling our GlamSmile veneers directly to consumers by using all forms of direct response media including the internet, print, radio, television and social network media, to expand our presence in Asia, with a primary focus on China, and Europe, as well as to establish a direct to consumer presence in United States.
Current Products
 
We currently have four primary products: ‘River 8’, a ‘prefab’ veneer; our custom-made GlamSmile Veneers, the SmileMe mirror and the ‘Condor’ intra-oral 3D scanner.
 
River8
 
For an instant smile make-over in just one visit, in 2012 we developed an impressive spectrum of prefabricated, ready-to-use veneers branded as River8.
 
River8 veneers come in 33 stylish Smile Boxes, each containing a set of 8 veneers to cover the smile zone of an upper or lower arch. With three different shapes, sizes and shades for the upper arch and one shape, two sizes and three shades for the lower arch, River8 has the largest instant veneer assortment worldwide.

With this full range of 264 veneer options to perfectly match the patient's expectations in just one visit, the dentist has an optimal selection at hand of the most attractive natural teeth based on extensive research. This enormous diversity enables the dentist to find the right combination of teeth for virtually every patient with whom only minor reshaping is required.
 
Fitting the River8 veneers is fast and easy. There’s no need for ‘free hand technique’ as with direct composite bonding; impressions and therefore lab intervention and communication are eliminated. Compared to the customized GlamSmile veneers, the ready-to-use River8 veneers are equally strong, ultrathin, CAD/CAM designed and also fabricated from the same IPS E-max material from Ivoclar to ensure consistent high quality.
 
 GlamSmile Veneers
 
In connection with the 2008 Restructuring, we shifted our focus to professional products targeted for the professional sector. Our key product in the professional oral care and cosmetic dentistry product is the GlamSmile veneer.
 
In 2006 we developed a revolutionary system for manufacturing and installing dental veneers which we branded as GlamSmile. GlamSmile veneers revolutionize the traditional one-at-a-time method of applying porcelain dental veneers.  GlamSmile veneers are attached to the front of the patient’s teeth using a patent pending single motion placement tray which replaces the traditional one at a time trial and error method of applying porcelain veneers, making the application less traumatic for the patient, much easier for the dentist and perhaps most important, far less costly than traditional dental veneers. The entire process is painless and takes only about an hour of the patient’s and the dentist’s time. GlamSmile veneers are so thin that the dentist does not need to remove healthy tooth structure which results in a process that is reversible. In the fall of 2006, we opened our initial GlamSmile Lab in Ghent.
 
Our GlamSmile involves a proprietary veneer fabrication technique and a patented single-motion veneer placement tray which are both guided by a proprietary computer imaging, design and digital preview system. The unique tray delivery system lets dentists expertly seat 10 ultra-thin, custom veneers in less than an hour while preserving tooth structure. All the features of GlamSmile, together with the CAD/CAM technology, digital preview for dentists to evaluate the design and a unique full arch tray delivery system used in conjunction with minimally or no preparation ultrathin veneers, have revolutionized the art of veneering.
 
Our GlamSmile veneers are ultra-thin claddings made from a mixture of a hybrid composite and porcelain materials which are attached to the front of the patient’s teeth.  GlamSmile veneers are ultra-thin and can best be compared to contact lenses in terms of thickness. Because GlamSmile veneers are so thin, the dentist does not need to remove healthy tooth structure. Leaving the patient’s healthy tooth structure intact results in several important benefits:
 

• | no local anesthesia is required to prepare the teeth;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced (if any) tooth sensitivity post-procedure; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | the process is reversible.
--+---------------------------

 
Our veneers are custom-made for each individual’s personal features, taking into account numerous factors including the shape of a person’s face, the shape of their lips and more. At the initial doctor visit, an impression is made of the patient’s teeth.  During the second visit, the hybrid composite veneers, which are computer generated as a single unit, are then ready to be installed.  The single-unit feature enables dentists with minimal training to apply up to ten teeth in one 30 – 45 minute visit.  This minimizes the risk of failure and allows more dentists to offer GlamSmile veneers as part of their dental practice. With traditional bonding, a dentist adheres a composite material directly on the tooth which lasts about 3 to 6 years and tends to discolor. Porcelain veneers, though a more lasting solution (ten years or more), require a significantly more invasive procedure to install, which is irreversible, requires a very high level of training and skill from the dentist and can cost from $700 to $2,000 per tooth.
 
SmileMe Mirror
 
The SmileMe Mirror is an integrated comprehensive marketing concept for the dental practice as if it were a plug-and-play tool. In fact, the Mirror enables the dentist to offer his patients a complete Smile Consultation in under 10 minutes. The SmileMe Mirror has a range of apps to assist the dentist with every step of Smile Consultancy: use SmileSketch to visualize the potential of smile makeover, discover what the patient actually desires with Smile Analysis, or explain the benefits of certain treatments with our various Treatment Pages.

Dental animations are not new, but we understood how to visualize dentistry in a way that makes patients feel comfortable. What on first glance might look like 13 simple questions is in fact a carefully crafted Smile Analysis. This list has been fine- tuned over the years by dental marketing experts and was specifically designed to make patients express their feelings and desires regarding their smiles. It’s the quickest way to understand what the patient actually expects from the dentist.
 
Perhaps the most distinct functionality of the SmileMe Mirror is SmileSketch, a quick and easy simulation software. By using the latest wireless and touch-screen technologies, the dentist needs no more than 30 seconds to make an attractive sketch of what the patient could look like. Very much like an artist’s initial sketch.
 
Condor Intra-oral scanner
 
Condor is not a “me too” version of what the current market is offering, but represents the next generation of intra-oral scanners. It is a significant advance in technology and cost efficiency that broadens the market substantially by offering this technology to dentists who were heretofore priced out of this market. Rather than a laser, this new device uses stereoscopic visible light to create its 3D scan, making the entire system less costly, more power efficient, smaller, lighter and inherently safer than laser-based systems. What’s more, because the system is open source, images and resulting crowns can be processed by any qualified lab, furthering flexibility for the dentist and lowering lab costs through the market.
 
A digital workflow is a seamless, more efficient, less labor-intensive manufacturing process for both dentists and labs. Restorations become more consistent, with improved quality. In addition, digital impressions also eliminate some chemical based processes. Traditional impressions are a chemical based procedure. When impressions set, there is an expansion of the material. The chemical based process of pouring a stone model also contains inaccuracies as the stone has a measurable setting expansion.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
We market our products to the dental professional using our business to business strategies (“B2B”), and we also market our products directly to the consumers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Canada and the United States of America using our direct to consumer model (“B2C”).  Our products are sold to dental professionals in over 30 countries through distributors.  We currently sell our products in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Canada and the United States of America directly to consumers using our direct to consumer model, which includes our GlamSmile Smile Design-Virtual Studio and GlamSmile Studios.
B2C Market and Distribution
 
In 2008 we opened, through a third party, our first GlamSmile center in Beijing China, marketing GlamSmile directly to consumers.  In 2009 we began direct to consumer tests in Belgium using internet advertising to acquire potential leads and our own dedicated “Smile Consultants” to manage the sales process from lead acquisition through final sale with successful results. Our direct to consumer model, has been developed around a one to one relationship with our Smile Consultants. This process also results in the dentists being relieved of the sales responsibilities allowing them to better focus on patient satisfaction. In both China and Belgium, with the aid of our own “Smile Consultant” working directly with the customer throughout the entire sales process, we have seen positive results in our partner retail centers.
 
Our Smile Consultancy Program is predominantly marketed on the internet through our website, GlamSmile Smile Design.  We focus on intensive campaign and advertisement aimed to generate large traffic to our website that promotes GlamSmile Whitening, Veneers and Free Smile Advice. Visitors can apply for a free personalized Smile Consultation by a Smile Consultant. The latter guides the consumer to the right GlamSmile Studio or with one of our GlamSmile partner dentists and to the solution that best meets his or her Smile expectations.  The Smile Consultancy Program requires us to develop close partnerships with dedicated GlamSmile dentists and the establishment of GlamSmile Studios. The GlamSmile Studio is a concept studio with a focus on aesthetic and cosmetic dentistry. Unlike a traditional dentist office, our GlamSmile Studios are designed and managed as a dental spa.
 
We have begun to market our products through our Smile Consultancy Concept and through the establishment of our GlamSmile Studios in Asia, with a primary focus on China, and Europe.   We currently have an ownership interest in the following Glamsmile Studios:

· | Wuhan Studio . In August 2014, we opened the Wuhan Studio through GlamSmile Asia.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In connection with the contemplated transactions in the Share Purchase Agreement on January 20, 2012, we entered into a Distribution, License and Manufacturing Agreement with Glamsmile Dental pursuant to which we appointed Glamsmile Dental as the exclusive distributor and licensee of Glamsmile Veneer Products bearing the “Glamsmile” name and mark in the B2C Market in the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Republic of China (Taiwan) and granted related manufacturing rights and licenses in exchange for the original issuance of 2,857,143 shares of Preference A-1 Shares of Glamsmile Dental and $250,000 (the receipt of which was acknowledged as an off set to payment of certain invoices of Glamsmile (Asia) Limited).
 
In February 2013, Remedent signed an exclusive agreement with France’s Biotech Medical Aesthetic SAS for distributing its River8 veneers worldwide. Biotech International is active in over 40 countries as a market leader in dental and orthopedic surgery implants.
 
Cosmetic Dentistry Industry
 
The cosmetic dental industry has expanded into a multi-billion industry as a result of increased awareness of the importance of oral health, high aesthetics, improved dental treatments, and reduced patient discomfort.  An increasingly aging population and rising disposable income have also positively impacted the growth of cosmetic dentistry. Demand for dental products and services are forecasted to remain healthy due to growing incidences of cosmetic treatments and dental implants.  According to a  report published by Koncepts Analytics, the dental industry worldwide was estimated at about $18.8 billion in 2008, dominated by the US, Europe and Japan, which collectively accounted for more than 84% of the global revenue in 2007. The United States Dental Market was nearly $7.6 billion in 2007, projected to grow to almost $8 billion in 2008 and nearly $10 billion by 2013, representing a compound annual growth rate of 4.7%. In 2012 a new estimation was brought forward in a study announcing that the growth rate would rise to a yearly 6.8%, representing a market at the end of 2014 of nearly $20 billion. The American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry estimates that Americans spend about $2.75 billion each year on cosmetic dentistry. The growth of this market is expected to be highest in the United States and EU where the generation of aging baby boomers can afford these quality but expensive dental procedures. Also expected to be a catalyst for the growth and popularity of cosmetic treatments and implants is the younger generation. Further, emerging technologies will reduce the overall turnaround time for dental procedures while improving efficiency of the dental practitioners. For example, introduction of CAD/CAM has reduced designing time and 3D imaging techniques have improved patient diagnosis and procedure planning. Changing consumer needs and a shift towards cosmetic dentistry will drive the market for high end dental solutions.
 
In China and other parts of Asia there has been a rapid growth in living standards. China’s young, emerging middle class is beginning to equate accumulation of possessions and leisure opportunities with quality of life. An estimated 415,000 Chinese had more than $1 million in disposable assets in 2007, more than any other country, according to the Merrill-Lynch Asia-Pacific Wealth Report. Up to 170 million people, or 13% of the population, can afford luxury brands and the number will increase in the years to come. These regions have a huge potential for growth in cosmetic dentistry due to low market penetration. Consequently, these countries are exhibiting high demand for modern and sophisticated technology and equipment in the dental market.

Overall demand for dental products in China is expected to climb to 11% annually through 2012. In a report published by Millennium Research Group with regard to Chinese markets for Dental Implants, a similar target market as that for our GlamSmile products, finds that this emerging market is growing quickly at a compound annual growth rate of more than 35%. A strong driver of this growth is the deregulation of dental services in China. Dental services in China are generally provided in government-managed facilities; however, ongoing deregulation of dental services is resulting in the emergence of an increased number of private dental practices and increasing accessibility to dental services. Another major driver in the Chinese market is the frequency of teeth stained by Tetracycline. For decades, Tetracycline was one of the most prescribed antibiotics in China causing many individuals to suffer from stained teeth. Excessive use of fluoride in drinking water causes a similar problem. When tetracycline exposure occurs while teeth are forming, it creates a permanent gray or brown stain, causing either uniform discoloration of the entire tooth or forming horizontal bands of stain of varying intensity that can range from mild to very dark. Veneers are the treatment of choice for this condition. In 2008, the Asia-Pacific market for dental prosthetics (crowns, bridges and dentures) was valued at over $6 billion. The Asia-Pacific market includes Australia, Japan and South Korea. The aging population and greater demand for aesthetic dentistry are driving forces in the prosthetics market.
 
We believe that our GlamSmile products which are affordable in comparison to traditional veneers, pain free, easy to apply, and provide instant results make us uniquely positioned to capitalize on the market trends in Asia, Europe, Middle East and the United States.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Today, our strategic plan is to focus our vertically integrated development, manufacturing and marketing resources on selling our GlamSmile veneers direct to consumers by using all forms of direct response media including the internet, print, radio, television and social network media, to expand our presence in China and Europe.  In our marketing efforts we intend to emphasize the ease, convenience, affordability and dramatic, instant results as demonstrated by before and after photos that are attained as a result of GlamSmile veneers. We will also feature our “Until You Smile” satisfaction guarantee. Using the success formula we experienced in China and Belgium using a "Smile Consultant" to help maintain control of the sales process and close the sale, our distribution will be through both owned and operated Glamsmile Studios as well as affiliations with existing dental practices and partner retail centers in Asia, Middle East and Europe.
 
Our current strategic marketing and distribution plan includes a combination of owned and licensed GlamSmile centers depending upon the size and location of the market, with us managing the marketing efforts, patient communications and sales process. We established two geographic divisions, Asia and Europe, each of which will promote GlamSmile veneer treatments in their respective territories. We plan to establish three types of GlamSmile Centers depending upon market factors and government regulation.
 

· | Owned Centers . These are centers in which the Company will own, control and/or manage all aspects of the operation including the facilities, equipment, personnel, marketing, insurance risk and other operating costs and will either employ or contract with dentists to perform the necessary dental services. In China, we will continue to principally rely on our owned and operated dental GlamSmile clinics or centers.

· | Licensed Centers . In many markets we will seek to identify and recruit cosmetic dentists that have existing practices and who endorse the GlamSmile veneer products. In these markets, we will contract with dental practices and the Company will recognize revenue through the sale of veneer trays plus marketing and other service fees to be charged to the dentist for services performed by the Company.

· | Distributors . In markets where we lack the expertise with respect to managing marketing and where local regulation and/or custom may make it impractical to deploy an owned or licensed center approach we will look to appoint distributors who will be granted exclusive rights to market and distribute our GlamSmile products directly to consumers subject to minimum performance criteria and/or initial territory fees. In this model the distributor will be expected to invest in all marketing and sales conversion costs in their market. Our revenues will be derived principally from sales of our GlamSmile veneer products to the distributor.

In order to support and facilitate our growth strategy, it is our intention to restructure our subsidiary companies to better manage our GlamSmile related operations. In conjunction with this restructuring, we intend to have the intellectual property and other assets related to GlamSmile contributed to a new entity to be formed to be called GlamSmile Worldwide. New entities would also be created called GlamSmile Asia and GlamSmile Europe, each with licensed rights to use and exploit the GlamSmile technology in their respective territories.

B2B Market and Distribution
 
Starting in Belgium and the Netherlands, our products have been introduced utilizing our Distributor Assisted Marketing programs.  We implement our program by first identifying an established dealer in each market with a well-developed sales force familiar with sales of capital equipment to the professional dentist community.  Second, we develop aggressive lead generation programs and other marketing techniques which served as a blue print for the dealers to implement.  The combination of a well-trained dealer force and dealer-assisted marketing and lead generation programs has proven to be far more effective than utilizing a direct sales approach, which is much slower and more costly to establish.  This process has been repeated for both the professional dentist and retail, over-the-counter markets in each country.  As a result of this approach, we have been able to establish dealers in over 30 countries encompassing, Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and the United States of America.
 
We previously sold our GlamSmile product in the United States and throughout the world with the exception of certain excluded territories and certain B2C markets pursuant to a distribution agreement. However, on March 27, 2012, the distribution agreements with Den-Mat were terminated pursuant to a certain Termination and Distribution Agreement with Den-Mat (“Den-Mat Distribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the Den-Mat Distribution Agreement, we granted Den-Mat a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free, license to use within certain territory, which among other territories excludes China, Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, the intellectual property that was the subject of the license to Den-Mat under the Amended and Restated Distribution, License and Manufacturing Agreement dated June 3, 2009, as amended from time to time (“Prior Agreements”), as such intellectual property relates the products which was the subject of the Prior Agreements. In connection with the termination of the Prior Agreements, under the Den-Mat Distribution Agreement, Den-Mat paid us $200,000. We currently sell our products in Asia, Europe and the Middle East directly to consumers using our direct to consumer model, which includes our GlamSmile Smile Design-Virtual Studio, and GlamSmile Studios.
 
 In September 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Excelsior Medical (“EM”) (the “EM license agreement”). Under the EM license agreement, we granted EM an exclusive license to certain Asian territories in exchange for $500,000 which was received during the year ended March 31, 2011. The Company received a further $500,000 from EM as an advance payment for veneers.  The $500,000 advance, less taxes withheld, was recorded as deferred revenue of $475,250 as of March 31, 2011.  Effective as of January 11, 2012, the Company entered into a Rescission Agreement with EM and Asia Best Healthcare Co., Ltd. Under the Rescission Agreement, the Company agreed to repay a total of $1,000,000 received under the Distribution Agreement, plus a simple interest rate of 5%, beginning on June 30, 2012, according to the following payment schedule: (i) $250,000 to be paid no later than June 30, 2012, (ii) $250,000 plus interest on June 30, 2012, (iii) $250,000 plus interest on December 31, 2012, and (iv) $250,000 plus interest on June 30, 2013. The Company also agreed to secure such obligations owed to EM with certain collateral of the Company. During the period ended December 31, 2012 a partial payment of $20,000 in interest has been made. Final settlement agreements were re-negotiated with EM and Asia Best Healthcare Co, Ltd. during January 2017. The company agreed to pay a total amount of $500,000 to EM as final settlement and simultaneously agreed to pay a total amount of $500,000 to Asia Best Healthcare co., Ltd as final settlement of the loan agreement. Both payments were executed on March 6, 2017 as final settlement.
 
Locations
 
The Company leases an office facility of 5,187 square feet in Gent, Belgium from an unrelated party pursuant to a lease expiring December 31, 2020 at a base rent of €6,353 per month for the total location ($7,139 per month at March 31, 2019).
 
Secondly, the Company leases an office facility of 635 square feet in Brussels, Belgium from an unrelated party pursuant to a lease expiring June 30, 2018 at a base rent of €969 per month for the total location ($1,089 per month at March 31, 2019).
 
Manufacturing
 
Prior to 2003, all of the manufacturing related to our dental products was conducted through third party manufacturers under our supervision thereby minimizing demands on capital resources.  Beginning in 2003, parts of the manufacturing and the majority of the final assembly of our products were brought in-house, thereby improving control over quality while significantly reducing costs.  These efforts were expanded significantly during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, in particular with regard to the expansion of in-house manufacturing capabilities for our gel products and foam strips. The Company manufactures products through outsourced manufacturing in China, Ghent, Belgium, and France.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development expenses decreased $1,740 to $120 for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $1,860 for the year ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of 93.5%.  Research and development expenses have decreased primarily because of the finalization of our software program the ‘SmileMe Mirror’.
Intellectual Property
 
We have secured the domain name www.glamsmile.com as well as other related internet domains in our targeted markets. We are continuing our ongoing research and development efforts to improve and expand our current technology and to develop new dental products.   We intend to apply for patents when we believe it is in our interest to do so and as advised by patent counsel.  We rely and will continue to rely on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary information in our business.  Certain of our key employees and consultants are required to enter into confidentiality and/or non-competition agreements to protect our confidential information.
Major Customers
 
At March 31, 2019 five customers accounted for a total of 23.59% of the Company’s trade accounts receivable and one of those customers accounted for 6.93% of total accounts receivable.   At March 31, 2018 five customers accounted for a total of 78.12% of the Company’s trade accounts receivable and one of those customers accounted for 60.77% of total accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and normally does not require collateral to support accounts receivable.
Competition
 
GlamSmile .  Our competition consists of alternative procedures that can be performed to achieve in part the results that would be achieved through a GlamSmile procedure, as well as competition from dentists not within the GlamSmile network who provide veneer procedures. With regard to alternative procedures, options available to the consumer include various whitening procedures, dental implants, dental bonding and dental caps. With the exception of whitening procedures, which for the most part cannot address many of the dental issues solved by GlamSmile veneers, the remaining alternatives all involve more cost, more patient discomfort and more time to complete. There are many dental practitioners that perform traditional veneer procedures. In most cases, traditional veneers will also be significantly more costly then GlamSmile veneers and require the dentist to remove more of the existing tooth material as well as requiring multiple patient visits to complete. That said, there will be existing practitioners that believe they can attain more customized results with the individual veneer approach as opposed to the GlamSmile tray approach and may be reluctant to offer our less costly procedure. To the best of our knowledge, GlamSmile will be “first to market” with respect to a direct to consumer advertising and promotion campaign for veneers anywhere which should enable us to capture market share in what we believe will be a rapidly growing market. Further, we have filed for patents on our proprietary tray delivery systems and have developed years of knowhow relating to treating patients with the multiple veneer approach. However, new technologies continue to be developed and new processes could be designed that would not violate our patents and result in similar solutions that could compete with GlamSmile products. Because we are uniquely positioned to have the ability to control the entire process from manufacturing to marketing to distribution, we believe it is feasible for us to have complete control and flexibility to maximize margins and respond aggressively to any competitive situation.
Regulatory Issues
 
Medical Device
 
As we market dental products which are legally defined to be medical devices, we are considered to be a medical device manufacturer and as such we are subject to the regulations of, among other governmental entities, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and the corresponding agencies of the states and foreign countries in which we sell our products.  These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture and labeling of medical devices, the maintenance of certain records and the reporting of potential product problems and other matters.  A failure to comply with such regulations could have material adverse effects on our business.

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) regulates medical devices in the United States by classifying them into one of three classes based on the extent of regulation believed necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness.  Class I devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through general controls, such as device listing, adequate labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) as well as medical device reporting, labeling and other regulatory requirements.  Some Class I medical devices are exempt from the requirement of pre-market approval or clearance.  Class II devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through the use of special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance and patient registries, as well as adherence to the general controls provisions applicable to Class I devices.  Class III devices are devices that generally must receive pre-market approval by the FDA pursuant to a pre-market approval application (“PMA”) to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices; however, this classification can also apply to novel technology or new intended uses or applications for existing devices.
 
Before most medical devices can be marketed in the United States, they are required by the FDA to secure either clearance of a pre-market notification pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDC Act (a “510(k) Clearance”) or approval of a PMA.  Obtaining approval of a PMA can take several years.  In contrast, the process of obtaining 510(k) Clearance generally requires a submission of substantially less data and generally involves a shorter review period.  Most Class I and Class II devices enter the market via the 510(k) Clearance procedure, while new Class III devices ordinarily enter the market via the more rigorous PMA procedure.  In general, approval of a 510(k) Clearance may be obtained if a manufacturer or seller of medical devices can establish that a new device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device other than one that has an approved PMA.  The claim for substantial equivalence may have to be supported by various types of information, including clinical data, indicating that the device is as safe and effective for its intended use as its legally marketed equivalent device.  The 510(k) Clearance is required to be filed and cleared by the FDA prior to introducing a device into commercial distribution.  Market clearance for a 510(k) Notification submission may take 3 to 12 months or longer.  If the FDA finds that the device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is deemed a Class III device, and a manufacturer or seller is required to file a PMA.  Approval of a PMA for a new medical device usually requires, among other things, extensive clinical data on the safety and effectiveness of the device.  PMA applications may take years to be approved after they are filed.  In addition to requiring clearance or approval for new medical devices, FDA rules also require a new 510(k) filing and review period prior to marketing a changed or modified version of an existing legally marketed device if such changes or modifications could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of that device.  The FDA prohibits the advertisement or promotion of any approved or cleared device for uses other than those that are stated in the device’s approved or cleared application. We believe that the GlamSmile products will not require a 510(k) submission because the products fall within an exemption under the 510(k) regulation.
 
International sales of medical devices are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country.  In Europe, the regulations of the European Union require that a device have a CE Mark, a mark that indicates conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be sold in that market.  In China, the State Food and Drug Administration (“SFDA”)  is the agency primarily responsible for regulating medical devices.  The regulatory international review process varies from country to country.  We rely upon our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to ensure we comply with the regulatory laws of such countries; In China, we continue to rely on our distributors and strategic partners to ensure compliance with regulatory laws of China.
 
Fee Splitting and Arrangements with Health Professionals
 
Many states in the United States and countries worldwide have laws that prohibit business corporations like us from practicing medicine, employing dentists to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by dentists, or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee splitting, with dentists. In light of these restrictions, in certain markets where permissible we intend to operate by maintaining management contracts with dentist owned corporations or other business entities that employ or contract with dentists to provide the GlamSmile and other dental services. Under these arrangements we will perform under contract only nonmedical administrative services, will not offer medical services and will not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the dentists employed by such business entities. In markets where fee splitting with a business corporation is prohibited, the fees that will be received by us will have been established on a basis that we believe complies with the applicable laws. However, regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with the affiliated professional contractors constitute unlawful fee splitting, in which case we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, the contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable (in whole or in part) or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements.

Dental Practice
 
Dental practices are subject to local and national regulations worldwide.  Although the laws and regulations for operating a dental practice and engaging in dental services vary from country to country, in general our dental studios require a health license and a business license.  In addition, the dentists providing services in the dental studios are also required to be licensed to practice.
 
While the Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations which regulate its business, and that it possesses all the licenses required in the conduct of its business, the failure to comply with any of those laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations could negatively impact the Company’s business.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
We are not in a business that involves the use of materials in a manufacturing stage where such materials are likely to result in the violation of any existing environmental rules and/or regulations.  Further, we do not own any real property that could lead to liability as a landowner.  Therefore, we do not anticipate that there will be any substantial costs associated with the compliance of environmental laws and regulations.
 
Employees
 
We currently retain 4 full-time employees in Belgium, 3 full-time employees and 1 consultant in the United States. Our subsidiary, Remedent, N.V., has an employment agreement with Mr. Philippe Van Acker our Chief Financial and Accounting Officer.  We have no employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Guy De Vreese.
