Item 1. Business
General
We are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk, and Koolaburra. Our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, performance, running, and outdoor markets. We believe that our products are distinctive and appeal to a broad demographic. We sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to our global consumers through our DTC business, which is comprised of our e-commerce websites and retail stores. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. All of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers. 
Products and Brands
UGG. The UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with expanded product offerings and a growing global audience that appeals to a broad demographic. We intend to continue diversifying the UGG brand to drive year-round product sales, including through expansion of Women’s spring and summer footwear, Men’s products, and apparel, accessories, and home goods. The UGG brand is sold globally, including in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.
HOKA. The HOKA brand is an authentic, premium line of year-round performance footwear and apparel that offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight. Originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and everyday athletes. Strong marketing has fueled both domestic and international sales growth for the HOKA brand, which has quickly become a leading brand within our run and outdoor specialty wholesale accounts and is rapidly growing within selective key accounts. The HOKA brand’s product line includes running, trail, hiking, fitness, and lifestyle. The HOKA brand is sold globally, including in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.
Teva. The Teva brand was born in the Grand Canyon and for decades has served as a trusted companion for outdoor adventure seekers around the world. Today, Teva builds upon sport sandal leadership, authentic outdoor heritage, and a commitment to sustainability to drive growth through category expansion and a young, diverse, and adventurous consumer. The Teva brand’s product line includes sandals, shoes, and boots. The Teva brand is sold globally, including in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. 
Sanuk. The Sanuk brand originated in Southern California surf culture and has manifested into a lifestyle brand with a presence in the relaxed casual shoe and sandal categories, focusing on innovations in comfort and sustainability. The Sanuk brand’s use of unexpected materials and unconventional constructions, combined with its fun and playful branding, are key elements of the brand’s identity. The Sanuk brand is primarily sold in the US. 
Other Brands. Other brands consist primarily of the Koolaburra brand. The Koolaburra brand is a casual footwear fashion line using plush materials and is intended to target the value-oriented consumer to complement the UGG brand offering. Our Other brands are primarily sold in the US and Canada.
Sales and Distribution
US Distribution. In our wholesale channel, we distribute our products in the US through sales representatives, who are organized by account type or geographically and by brand. In addition to our wholesale channel, we sell products directly to consumers through our DTC business and fulfill online orders through our DCs and retail stores. 
Our sales force is separated by brand, as each brand generally has certain specialty customers that expect a dedicated sales team with specialized knowledge of the brand’s product offerings. However, there is some overlap between the sales teams and customers, and we have aligned our brands’ sales forces to position them for the future success of all of our brands. 
We currently distribute products sold in the US through our DCs in Moreno Valley, California, and Mooresville, Indiana, as well as through a 3PL in Pennsylvania. Our DCs feature a warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pick and pack products for direct shipment to customers. Further, we intend to expand our DCs in the US.
Refer to Part I, Item 2, “Properties,” and Note 7, “Leases and Other Commitments,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our properties and related minimum lease and other commitments.
International Distribution. Internationally, in our wholesale channel, we distribute our products through independent distributors and wholly owned subsidiaries in many regions and countries, including Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, among others. We also sell products internationally, particularly in China, through partner retail stores, which are branded stores that are wholly owned and operated by third parties. In addition, in certain countries we sell products through our DTC business. For our wholesale and DTC businesses, we distribute our products through a number of DCs managed by 3PLs in certain international locations. 
UGG Wholesale. We sell our UGG brand products primarily through fashion lifestyle retailers such as Urban Outfitters and ASOS, domestic higher-end department stores such as Nordstrom, Dillard’s, and Macy’s, streetwear and sports style partners such as Footlocker and Journey’s, as well as online retailers such as Amazon.com, Zappos.com, and Zalando.com. As the retail marketplace continues to evolve to reflect changing consumer preferences, we continually review and evaluate our UGG wholesale distribution and product segmentation approach. For example, as the UGG brand continues to amplify its audience with younger consumers, our distribution to these consumers is expanding faster through our lifestyle and sports style partners. 
HOKA Wholesale. We sell select HOKA brand footwear primarily through full-service domestic specialty retailers such as Fleet Feet, JackRabbit, Road Runner Sports, REI, select online retailers such as Zappos.com, and other strategic partners, such as DICK’s Sporting Goods, Running Warehouse, and Nordstrom. We continue to expand our HOKA brand wholesale distribution in international markets, including through strategic partners such as Intersport and Sport 2000 in Europe and Xebio Group and Himaraya in Japan.
Teva Wholesale. We sell our Teva brand footwear primarily through specialty outdoor retailers, sporting goods and department stores, including REI, Famous Footwear, United Arrows, ABC Mart, Aeon Sports, Urban Outfitters, DICK’s Sporting Goods, DSW, and Nordstrom, and online retailers such as Amazon.com and Zappos.com. 
Sanuk Wholesale. We sell our Sanuk brand footwear primarily through domestic independent action sports and outdoor specialty footwear retailers, as well as larger national retail chains, including Journeys, Dillard’s, DSW, REI, and online retailers such as Amazon.com and Zappos.com. 
Other Brands Wholesale. We sell our Other brands’ footwear primarily through department stores and online retailers. Key accounts of the Koolaburra brand include larger national retail chains, including Kohl’s, DSW, Macy’s, QVC, Shoe Carnival, and Famous Footwear, as well as online retailers such as Amazon.com and Zappos.com.
Direct-to-Consumer. Our DTC business is comprised of our e-commerce business, which we operate through various websites and platforms, and retail stores. Our websites and retail stores are largely intertwined and interdependent. In an omni-channel marketplace, we believe many of our consumers interact with both our retail stores and our websites before making purchasing decisions. For example, consumers may feel or try on products in our retail stores and then place an order online later. Conversely, they may initially research products online, and then view inventory availability by store location and make a purchase in store. We have observed a meaningful shift in the way consumers shop for products and make purchasing decisions, evidenced by decreases in consumer retail store activity as consumers accelerate their migration to online shopping. We have optimized our digital marketing strategy to capitalize on these trends, which has accelerated global online consumer acquisition and retention rates. Although we continue to see consumers migrate to online shopping, our DTC online and retail sales channels interact with each other and largely overlap to provide a fluid purchasing experience, which engenders brand loyalty while increasing product sales and improving our inventory productivity. Further, our domestic and international consumer loyalty programs allow our consumers to earn points and awards across the DTC business, which has contributed to higher brand demand. 
Our retail stores enable us to expose consumers to a more curated selection of products, directly impact our consumers’ experience with our brands, and sell our products at retail prices thereby generating larger gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin). Our retail stores are predominantly UGG brand concept stores and UGG brand outlet stores, though also include recent openings in our retail store fleet for the HOKA brand. Through our outlet stores, we sell some of our discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, as well as products made specifically for the outlet stores. We continue to open outlet stores in key markets to further grow our brand presence and appeal to a broader consumer base. We also have several UGG brand flagship stores and recently opened a HOKA brand flagship store, which are lead concept stores in key markets designed to showcase the UGG and HOKA brand products, respectively. We continue to evaluate future locations for a curated fleet of mono branded retail stores for the UGG and HOKA brands to continue interacting with our consumers and enhancing brand loyalty.
As of March 31, 2022, we operate our e-commerce business through Company-owned websites and mobile platforms in 59 different countries, and have a total of 149 global retail stores, which includes 75 concept stores and 74 outlet stores.
Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report for further disclosure and discussion of our DTC business.
Product Design and Development
The design and development functions for all of our brands are performed by a combination of internal design and development staff and outside freelance designers. Our design and development staff work closely with brand management to develop new styles and product lines. Throughout the development process, we have multiple design and development reviews, which we then coordinate with our independent manufacturers. To ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in our product design and development process, we continually evaluate the availability and cost of raw materials, the capabilities and capacity of our independent manufacturers, and the target retail price of new products. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
We outsource the production of our products to independent manufacturers, which are primarily located in Asia. We generally purchase products from our manufacturers on the basis of individual purchase orders or short-term purchase commitments, rather than maintaining long-term purchase commitments, which provides us greater flexibility to adapt to changing consumer preferences, changes in international trade relations, and evolving inventory management requirements. Production by our independent manufacturers is performed in accordance with our detailed product specifications and rigorous quality control and operating compliance standards. We maintain a buying office in Hong Kong, as well as on-site supervisory offices in China and Vietnam, which collectively serve as a strong link to our independent manufacturers. We believe our strong regional presence enhances our manufacturing processes by providing predictability of material availability and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and adherence to quality control standards and final design specifications.
The majority of the materials and components used in the production of our products by these independent manufacturers are purchased from independent suppliers that we designate. At our direction, our manufacturers purchase the majority of the sheepskin used in our products from two tanneries in China, which source their sheepskin primarily from Australia and the United Kingdom (UK). We maintain routine communication with the tanneries to closely monitor the supply of high-quality sheepskin for our projected UGG brand production. To ensure an adequate supply of sheepskin, we forecast our expected usage in advance at a forward price. We also enter into fixed purchasing contracts and other pricing arrangements with certain sheepskin, leather, and UGGpure suppliers to manage price volatility. We believe current supplies are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated demand, but we continually monitor our supply chain and investigate options to accommodate our expected growth, as well as unexpected supply chain issues. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 7, “Leases and Other Commitments,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our minimum purchase commitments.
We require our independent manufacturers and designated suppliers, including our partners and licensees, to adopt our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct, which specifies that they comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption laws, restricted substances, and environmental compliance, including animal welfare and conflicts minerals, before we are willing to conduct business with them.
We use a proprietary raw material, UGGpure, which is almost entirely repurposed wool woven into a durable backing, and UGGplush, which is almost entirely repurposed wool and lyocell woven into a durable backing, in some of our UGG brand products. As part of an ongoing effort to eliminate waste as part of our corporate sustainability efforts, at this time, all of the wool in UGGpure and UGGplush is sheared from the sheepskin we are already using in our products. In addition, we are continuing to drive our strategy of introducing counter-seasonal products through category expansion, including the UGG brand’s spring and summer products, as well as the year-round performance footwear product offering of the HOKA brand, which we believe will help further reduce our dependency on sheepskin. Excluding sheepskin, UGGpure, and UGGplush, we believe that substantially all raw materials and components used to manufacture our products, including wool, rubber, leather, and nylon webbing, are generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 
Inventory Management and Product Returns
We have an extended design and manufacturing process, which involves the initial design of our products, the purchase of raw materials, the accumulation of inventories, the subsequent sale of the inventories, and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable. This production cycle results in significant liquidity requirements and working capital fluctuations throughout our fiscal year. Because our production cycle typically involves long lead times, which requires us to make manufacturing decisions several months in advance of an anticipated purchasing decision by the customer, it is challenging for us to estimate and manage our inventory and working capital requirements. 
We seek to manage our inventory levels by considering existing customer orders, forecasted sales and budgets for both our wholesale and DTC channels, and the delivery requirements of our customers. Our systems and processes are designed to improve our product forecasting, inventory control and supply chain management capabilities and we are making investments in a new end-to-end planning system to further support our scaling business, including our e-commerce business. In addition, added discipline around SKU productivity, product purchasing decisions, the reduction of production lead times, and the sale of excess inventory through our liquidation channels, are key areas of focus that we expect will further enhance inventory performance. 
Our general practice, and the general practice in our industry, is to offer customers in our wholesale channel the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise, and to accept returns from our consumers in the DTC channel between 30 to 90 days from the point of sale for cash or credit.
We encourage our customers to place a significant portion of orders as pre-season orders, which are typically placed up to 12 months prior to the anticipated shipment date, as well as in-season fill-in orders that can be shipped immediately. We work with our customers through pre-season programs to enable us to better plan our production schedule, inventory, and shipping requirements. 
Similar to other companies in our industry, we continue to experience supply chain challenges across each of the geographies in which we operate. The most significant macro-level supply chain impacts continue to be extended transit lead times and cost pressures due primarily to container shortages, port congestion, and trucking and labor scarcity. As we manage product availability, we are focused on mitigating the impacts of ongoing supply chain disruptions in both the wholesale and DTC channels, including through the early procurement of inventory in the country of sale, which will likely result in higher levels of inventory, to allow us to maintain expected service levels into our next fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 (next fiscal year).
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report for further information on the associated risks and impacts on our business for supply chain disruptions. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report under the sections entitled “Trends and Uncertainties Impacting Our Business and Industry,” “Liquidity,” and “Contractual Obligations” for further information on the impact of supply chain disruptions on our results of operations, our working capital and operating requirements, as well as our purchase obligations for product, respectively.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
As a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories, our worldwide reach and impact is significant. We believe consumers are increasingly buying brands that advance sustainable business practices and deliver quality products while striving for minimal environmental impact by employing socially conscious operations. Our sustainability policies and strategies are aligned with, and informed by, our ongoing efforts with multi-stakeholder initiatives, which involve our stockholders, employees, suppliers, and our customers, as well as other brands and non-governmental organizations. Through our holistic environmental, social and governance program, which has been in existence since 2010, we are committed to advancing our sustainable business initiatives. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized by Newsweek as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies and included on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index during fiscal year 2022.

ESG Oversight. Our Board of Directors, through its Corporate Governance Committee, which is comprised of four independent directors, oversees our ESG efforts. The Corporate Governance Committee and full Board of Directors regularly receives updates on the status of our ESG program. Our Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) is responsible for the day-to-day management of our ESG program. The program’s execution is driven by our leadership team and various cross-functional teams including our ethical sourcing, facilities, DCs, brands, innovation, materials, and supply chain teams. 
Our ESG program aligns our internal teams with our Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and establishes policies to encourage our partners and suppliers to employ sustainable business practices. We annually assess risks related to ESG issues as part of our overall enterprise risk management approach. In addition, our internal audit team provides periodic targeted reviews of our ESG-related policies and procedures to the Audit & Risk Management Committee. 
Stakeholder Engagement. We highly value stakeholder input and have consistently demonstrated our commitment to maintaining open and interactive dialogue on ESG matters with our stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, employees, suppliers, industry groups, communities and governments, to ensure their views are actively considered in executing our ESG program. Our stakeholder outreach program is led by a cross-functional team that includes members of our investor relations, compliance, sustainability, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and legal teams. Additionally, we actively engage with our employees to obtain valuable feedback and track progress. 
Sustainable Development Goals. Achieving measurable sustainability success is critical to our future economic and business growth, and we work to establish SDGs that we believe will make the most significant impact for our business, our stockholders, and the communities in which we operate. We are a member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative. This membership requires an annual statement of progress, which is reflected in our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report (Creating Change Report). Our CAO identifies specific SDGs established by the UNGC, which we adopt to guide our efforts to address environmental and social challenges. Our SDGs are currently focused on categories where we believe we can make substantial impacts.
The following is a brief overview of our SDGs and related achievements during fiscal year 2022: 
•Materials. We strive to maximize the amount of environmentally preferred materials in our products (including recycled, renewable, regenerated, and natural materials). During fiscal year 2022, we sourced the vast majority of our leather supplies from Leather Working Group-certified tanneries, which promote sustainable and environmentally friendly business practices within the leather industry. We continued to utilize our third-party, science-based Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) tool to guide our brands toward leveraging preferred materials. 
Our goal through calendar year 2022 is for any virgin market wool to be certified by the Responsible Wool Standard, which addresses the welfare of sheep and the land they graze on. We require our supply chain partners to comply with our Ethical Sourcing and Animal Welfare Policy and have amplified our requirements for leathers sourced from South America by implementing detailed traceability standards to address deforestation. In addition, we do not believe in the exploitation or killing of animals solely for the purpose of their fur. We only use hides that are the byproduct of the meat industry and, with our innovative UGGpure and UGGplush technologies, the wool used in our UGG brand footwear is almost entirely repurposed from sheepskin we are already using. 
•Waste. We aim to sustainably reduce waste generated at our facilities and partner facilities through reduction, recycling, and reuse. Our DC in Moreno Valley, California has undertaken efforts to become a zero-waste facility by calendar year 2023. We have taken steps to remove most single-use plastic from our packaging at our corporate headquarters, and have eliminated single-use plastic bags from our retail stores. We have also implemented tracking programs with the majority of our manufacturing partners to monitor waste generation and waste diversion methods and we continue to monitor all supplier partners through our ongoing LCA outreach efforts. 
•Water. We strive to mitigate water scarcity in the countries we operate in by reducing water consumption and improving water quality throughout our operations. We have reduced water consumption among our monitored manufacturing partners and have set reduction targets for our suppliers. We expect our partners to adhere to the highest standards of water efficiency and discharge. 
•Chemistry. We seek to achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and reduce the discharge of hazardous substances among our key business partners. Since fiscal year 2021, our Restricted Substances team manages and controls over 1,600 restricted substances and are constantly exploring cleaner chemistries where possible.
•Climate and Clean Energy. We aim to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions throughout our operations. We set ambitious Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon reduction targets with the Science-Based Targets initiative, which provides guidance to companies to set targets in line with the latest climate science. We have also engaged a third-party expert, Carbon Trust, to oversee our carbon accounting, and have collaborated with them to establish our carbon reduction targets. We are founders of the Savory Institute's Land to Market program, working to protect and reverse environmental degradation through regenerative farming practices. During fiscal year 2022, we established a long-term grant with Savory Institute to support regenerative farming practices on sheep farms in Australia, influencing over 200,000 acres and 40 farms.
•Gender Equality and Quality Education. We are committed to accelerating our DEI efforts to make a meaningful difference for our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. In fiscal year 2022, we debuted on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which helps bring transparency to gender-related practices and policies at publicly-listed companies around the world. In addition to our own corporate DEI efforts, we promote gender equality and quality education at our supply chain partners through our partnership with the Business for Social Responsibility’s HERproject, which positively impacts the well-being of women through workplace-based education and training to promote health, gender equality and financial inclusion. Further, each of our brands has committed to represent Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Allies (LGBTQIA+), and diverse body types and abilities in their marketing campaigns.
•Human Rights. We are committed to positively impacting the communities in which we operate, including assuring industry leading human rights practices within our supply chain. We have established robust criteria in our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct, based on International Labour Organization standards, which outlines our expectations of our partners on various topics including child labor, forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, harassment, discrimination, health and safety, compensation, working hours, freedom of association, and environment. Topics covered in our Supplier Code of Conduct, health and safety ratings, and environmental performance are included in our performance scorecards which are regularly reviewed by our leadership team. Partners who underperform are placed on corrective action plans and monitored more frequently. We are members of the Transparency Pledge to promote a standard for supply chain disclosure in the garment and footwear industry. We publish a list that includes all of our Tier 1 and Tier 2 supply chain partners and ensure it is regularly updated to include key details like number of employees at each site, location, and types of products made. We are also members of The Social & Labor Convergence Program, a multi-stakeholder initiative whose goal is to increase the effectiveness of factory audits. 
Our brands are each fully committed to sustainability, fully embrace our targets, and continue to launch sustainable collections. For example, the UGG brand’s Plant Power Collection features carbon-neutral, plant-based materials, and the brand’s Icon Impact Collection leverages environmentally preferred materials, such as lyocell, renewable sugarcane EVA, cotton, hemp, repurposed wool and recycled polyester made from recycled plastic bottles. The HOKA brand continues to focus on integrating more environmentally preferred materials in its footwear and launched a sustainable apparel collection. Further, the Teva brand partnered with TerraCycle® to give well-worn Teva sandals new life as downcycled materials. The Sanuk brand continues to offer the SustainaSole™ Collection featuring styles comprised of 55% total recycled material by weight and undyed uppers.
Our Creating Change Report for the year ended March 31, 2022, which will be published under the “Responsibility” tab of our website located at www.deckers.com, will provide more information regarding our fiscal year 2022 ESG achievements with a focus on the above SDGs. We believe that the progress of our corporate responsibility efforts is served by disclosing goals and relevant metrics and, to that end, we have aligned the reporting standards included in our Creating Change Report with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (commonly referred to as TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative’s (commonly referred to as GRI) Core Standards, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (commonly referred to as SASB, and now part of the Value Reporting Foundation) Consumer Goods Sector Apparel, Accessories and Footwear Index. The content of our historical Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. 
Human Capital - Our People and Our Culture 
Employees. As of March 31, 2022, we employ approximately 4,000 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia. This includes approximately 1,400 employees in our retail stores worldwide, which includes part-time and seasonal employees. For a variety of reasons, we believe that our relationship with our employees is generally favorable. 

Culture. Our purpose is to positively impact the world by uniting purposeful brands with diverse people driven to succeed and create change. Our key values, which guide our journey onward together to improve our business and create a better world around it, help hold us accountable to deliver on this purpose:
•    Come as you are. Authentic employees create an authentic company. 
•    Better together. The power of independent spirit, united for a common goal. 
•    Commit to create. Curiosity fuels creativity, which in turn fuels innovation. 
•    Own it. We set high targets and hit them and take accountability when we don’t. 
•    Do good and do great. We act with integrity and humility and respect each other and our communities to drive a sustainable business. 

Our values define our Company and serve as the driving force behind how we work together and work with customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, and communities. We also have detailed ethics and compliance policies that instill a commitment to ethical behavior and legal compliance across our Company. Through our open-door policy and culture, employees are encouraged to approach their managers if they believe violations of standards or policies have occurred and are also able to make confidential and anonymous reports using a 24/7 online or telephone hotline hosted by an independent third-party provider. 
Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We promote DEI and believe that creating a diverse and inclusive workplace is critical to ensuring all of our employees can come as they are and can bring their authentic selves to work each day. We believe the inclusion of diverse perspectives, and amplifying voices of underrepresented communities brings a unique set of experiences, opinions, and thoughts on critical issues that help enhance our business and drive better outcomes. To that end, our Board of Directors is currently comprised of a total of ten directors, 40% of whom are female, and 60% of whom are from underrepresented communities. As of March 31, 2022, 21% of our director-level and above employees in the US are from BIPOC communities. This represents an increase of 6% compared to fiscal year 2021 and an overall increase of more than 9% since fiscal year 2020. Further, during fiscal year 2022, 44% of all new hires reporting into the US corporate office were BIPOC.
Our Code of Ethics, on which we train our employees biennially, as well as our annual Creating Change Report, codifies these values and our commitment to DEI. We have a robust collection of programs designed to support creating a more inclusive workplace, as well as policies and practices aimed at increasing diversity. We have implemented a comprehensive, global strategy for DEI, including the following:
•Our brands have committed to having at least 60% of individuals in our marketing campaigns who represent the BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ communities and diverse body types and abilities.
•We have created a framework for the creation of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are formed around common interests, background or characteristics including gender, race, ethnicity, and other affinities. We have nine ERGs with approximately 300 employee members as of March 31, 2022. 
•All director-level and above positions are interviewed by a panel that includes individuals from underrepresented communities. 
•We are continuing to utilize software that optimizes job descriptions to help ensure a more diverse applicant pool, as well as redacting certain resume information that may lead to unconscious bias.
•We are expanding the pool from which we source our talent, including partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as local and national professional organizations.
•We have joined The Valuable 500, which is a business-to-business initiative comprised of companies committed to disability inclusion, the Civic Alliance, which is a nonpartisan business coalition that champions democracy and civic participation, and we are part of the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. 
•We have deployed mandatory anti-racism and implicit bias training, as well as a suite of additional learning and development resources available to employees, including Inclusive Interviewing and Selection for managers, Disability Awareness & Inclusion, and Applying DEI Practices to Product Lifecycle, among others aimed at increasing employee acumen about DEI-focused topics. 
•We host Coffee & Conversations, monthly small-group facilitated discussions on DEI-related topics.
•We have a global mentorship program to help provide our existing talent with networking and engagement opportunities. 
Charitable Giving and Volunteering. Our charitable contributions, product donations, and employee volunteer efforts are an essential part of our culture. Each fiscal year, we contribute to our local communities through monetary donations, volunteer efforts and in-kind donations. During fiscal year 2022, we donated approximately $3,000 to various non-profit organizations, primarily to organizations focused on DEI initiatives, environmental impact mitigation, and community support. We also continued our ‘Art of Kindness’ events, where employees volunteer during a week-long event in our local communities multiple times during the fiscal year. Our employees volunteered over 14,000 hours in fiscal year 2022. Further, our supply chain partners followed our lead and volunteered in their local communities during fiscal year 2022. Our strategic giving and community-engagement efforts continued to be aligned with our SDGs, including DEI, the environment, uplifting youth, education, and community support. We also encourage our employees to volunteer by compensating each employee for up to 24 hours of volunteer time each calendar year and offer incentives for payments to employees’ charity of choice when meeting 100 hours of volunteer time per calendar year. 
Talent Development and Retention.  The ability to attract, develop and retain employees is critical to our long-term success. We focus on our employees’ growth, creating experiences that align with our strategic priorities and promote inclusion, performance, and opportunities for development. For example, our leadership team mentors rising talent on a formal and informal basis, which we believe accelerates the development of our top performers, increases organizational learning, and improves employee performance and retention. Further, our executive leadership team and Board of Directors commits substantial time to evaluating the bench strength of our leadership and supporting their career development while improving organizational performance.
We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages, and annual increases based on merit, as well as annual cash bonus compensation, which is based on Company and individual performance. We provide tuition reimbursement for eligible US employees up to $5 thousand per calendar year. We were also one of the first companies to increase the minimum wage in all retail stores across the US to $15 dollars per hour, since November 2020. Further, to foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of management with stockholders, time-based restricted stock units and long-term incentive plan performance stock units are granted to a substantial proportion of our leadership team under our stock-based compensation programs. In addition, employees across the US business have the opportunity to purchase stock at a discounted price through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Further, we engage an independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, which provides us with information to evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation program, including competitive pay practices and trends in our industry, the design and structure of our executive compensation program, as well as the formulation of and benchmarking against our peers within our industry.
Employee Wellness. We strive to be one of the best places to work and recognize our employees are at different stages of life and have specific individual needs. We offer affordable, innovative, comprehensive and competitive benefits package that range from health insurance, retirement plan, life insurance, disability, accident coverage, paid time off, paid and unpaid leave including maternity and paternity leave, mental health benefits and other voluntary benefits such as health savings accounts or our recent solar and electric car reimbursement program. We also provide resources to support our many employees who work from home as part of our new flexible work model (FWM), including equipment and furniture for their home office setup and workshops and tools for leading remote teams. 
Employee Health and Safety. The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. We have comprehensive safety training programs that ensure our employees know how to do their jobs safely and in compliance with laws and regulations. We operate in modern, efficient, and safe facilities.
In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees during the pandemic, as part of our new FWM, we continue to allow those employees who could perform their jobs remotely to have a virtual work environment, and we are limiting the number of employees on-site relative to our typical personnel office capacity. We have also implemented enhanced safety measures and protocols at our facilities where on-site work is necessary, including enhanced cleaning protocols and mask requirements where locally mandated.
Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
Our six reportable operating segments include the five strategic business units responsible for the worldwide operations of the wholesale divisions of our brands (UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk, and Other brands), plus our DTC business. Refer to Note 12, “Reportable Operating Segments,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information regarding our reportable operating segments. Additionally, refer to Note 13, “Concentration of Business,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for financial information about geographic areas and concentration of related business risks.

Our business is seasonal, with the highest percentage of UGG and Koolaburra brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st and the highest percentage of Teva and Sanuk brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. Net sales for the HOKA brand occur more evenly throughout the year reflecting the brand's year-round performance product offerings. Due to the magnitude of the UGG brand relative to our other brands, our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st have historically significantly exceeded our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. However, as we continue to take steps to diversify and expand our product offerings by creating more year-round styles, and as net sales of the HOKA brand continue to increase as a percentage of our aggregate 
net sales, we expect the impact from seasonality to continue to decrease over time and we have begun to experience shifts during fiscal year 2022 for higher sales in the quarter ending March 31st. However, our seasonality has been impacted by supply chain challenges and it is unclear whether these impacts will be minimized or exaggerated in future periods as a result of these disruptions. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report for further discussion of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, as well as factors that may impact our future results of operations. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our competitors include athletic and footwear companies, branded apparel companies and retailers with their own private labels. Although the industry is fragmented, many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources, several of which compete directly with some of our products. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing and the growth of e-commerce has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear, apparel, and accessories industry. In particular, and in part due to the popularity of our UGG brand and HOKA brand products, we face increasing competition from a significant number of domestic and international competitors selling products designed to compete directly or indirectly with our products. We believe that our ability to successfully compete depends on numerous factors, including our ability to predict, assess, and respond quickly to changing consumer tastes and preferences, produce appealing products that meet expectations for product quality and technical performance, maintain and enhance the image and strength of our brands, price our products competitively, and weather the impacts and disruptions caused by the pandemic, among others. In addition, we believe that our key customers face intense competition from other department stores, sporting goods stores, retail specialty stores, and online retailers, among others, which could negatively impact the financial stability of their businesses and their ability to conduct business with us. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and results of operations.
Patents and Trademarks 
We utilize trademarks for virtually all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our products, promoting our brands, and distinguishing our products from the products of others. We currently hold trademark registrations for “UGG,” “Teva,” “Sanuk,” “HOKA,” “Koolaburra by UGG,” “UGGpure,” and other marks in the US, and for certain of the marks in many other countries, including Canada, China, the UK, various countries in the European Union (EU), Japan, and Korea. As of March 31, 2022, we hold 193 designs and inventions with corresponding design or utility patent registrations, plus 40 designs and inventions which are currently pending registration. These patents expire at various times. We regard our proprietary rights as valuable assets and vigorously protect such rights against infringement by third parties.
Government Regulation
Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations has not had, and it is not expected to have, any material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or competitive position based on information and circumstances known to us at this time.
