ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Introduction 
 We are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to herein as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry, we intend to focus on identifying high growth technology and tech-enabled businesses domestically and abroad in the consumer internet, ecommerce, software, healthcare, transportation / mobility and financial services industries, as well as other industries that are being disrupted by advances in technology and on technology paradigms including artificial intelligence (AI), automation, data science, ecommerce and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). 
 We believe that our management teams decades of experience and relationships with leading technology companies and their founders, executives and investors, in addition to the extensive industry and geographical reach of our network, along with our prior experience with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) business combinations, give us a competitive advantage in pursuing a broad range of opportunities in many industries. 
 On January 14, 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (initial public offering, IPO or Public Offering) of 30,000,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 3,900,000 Units as a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A ordinary shares), and one-half of one warrant of the Company (Warrant), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000. 
 On February 18, 2021, pursuant to an agreement by and between the Company and 10X Capital SPAC Sponsor III LLC (the Sponsor), our Sponsor purchased 11,672,500 Class B ordinary shares (the founder shares) for $25,000. On December 1, 2021, our Sponsor surrendered 2,089,167 founder shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor holder 9,583,333 founder shares. On January 11, 2022, the Company effected a share capitalization of 421,667 founder shares, resulting in our Sponsor holding 10,005,000 founder shares as of the date of our final prospectus. Prior thereto, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 25% of the outstanding shares after the IPO. In connection with the underwriters partial exercise of the over-allotment option and the expiration of the remaining portion of the over-allotment option, on March 11, 2022, 5,000 founder shares were forfeited resulting in an aggregate of 10,000,000 founder shares outstanding. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to private placement units purchase agreements (the Private Placement Units Purchase Agreements), the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 1,153,000 units (the private placement units) to the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (Cantor) at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $1,153,000 (the Private Placement). In the Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased 881,000 private placement units and Cantor purchased 272,000 private placement units. The private placement units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the private placement units (including the underlying securities) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and will be entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. The private placement units purchased by the Sponsor was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The private placement units purchased by Cantor or its affiliates were deemed underwriters compensation by FINRA pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110 and are subject to compliance with the lock-up and resale registration provisions of that rule.

 A total of $304,500,000 (equal to $10.15 per Unit), comprised of $294,780,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $14,280,000 of the underwriters deferred commission) and $9,720,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Companys initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold in the IPO (public shares) properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Companys amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to allow redemption in connection with its initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination by January 14, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination by January 14, 2023, subject to applicable law. 
 After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $14,280,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $741,000 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, $1,800,000 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. 
 Our Management Team 
 Our management team is led by Hans Thomas, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
 Mr. Thomas is a serial entrepreneur and technology investor with a track record of over 20 years, featured in Bloomberg News, Asset-backed Alert and The Wall Street Journal. He is 10X Capitals founder and chief executive officer of and serves as chairman of its subsidiary, GTP. As an entrepreneur, Mr. Thomas was on the founding teams of venture-backed FinTech startup InternetCash (1999), online mortgage firm RefinanceOne (2004) and data science firm TheNumber (2015). Mr. Thomas is regarded as a top technology sector investor, financier and visionary because of his track record of identifying and investing in promising early stage opportunities and connecting them with institutional capital to help accelerate their growth. Mr. Thomas credibility as a founder as well as an investor has made him one of the first calls for Silicon Valley venture capitalists on topics of finance and capital markets, as well as for Wall Street firms and investors seeking access to technology investments and tech-enabled assets, as clearly seen by a portfolio that has attracted investors and financiers from both camps. Notable portfolio companies and personal investments exemplifying this strategy include Robinhood, AlphaFlow, Inc., Milo Credit, Better and Climb, whose equity investors include Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Point72 Ventures, Social Capital, and QED Investors, and whom have obtained significant financing from leading institutional investors and investment banks, such as The Blackstone Group, Inc. (NYSE: BX), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) & Jefferies Group LLC (Jefferies). Mr. Thomas attended New York University. 
 Our team also includes: David Weisburd, our COO, Head of Origination and director; Oliver Wriedt, our President and Head of Capital Markets; and Guhan Kandasamy, our Chief Financial Officer. 
 Mr. Weisburd is currently a general partner and co-head of venture capital at 10X Capital, where he led 10X Capitals investments in Robinhood, Compass Therapeutics, HeadSpace, Udemy and DraftKings. Prior to 10X Capital, Mr. Weisburd founded, in 2012, and was general partner of venture capital firm GTP, which was acquired by 10X Capital in 2019, whose portfolio companies include 23andMe, Circle, Palantir, Pipefy, Ripple, Tonal, Vicarious and Wish. Prior to joining 10X Capital, Mr. Weisburd was a partner at Flight Ventures, which has a prolific track record investing in companies including Carta, Cruise, Discord, Dollar Shave Club, Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY), LinkedIn, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: PYPL), Rent the Runway, Wealthfront Inc. and many others. Prior to his venture capital career, Mr. Weisburd was on the founding teams of two venture-backed technology startups, isocket

  (acquired by Rubicon Project (Nasdaq: RUBI)) and RoomHunt (acquired by RentLingo, Inc.). Mr. Weisburd received a BS in Management and Entrepreneurship from Indiana University  Kelley School of Business in 2008 and an MBA from Dartmouth College  Tuck School of Business in 2012. Mr. Weisburd is currently pursuing a Masters degree in Psychology from Harvard University. 
 Mr. Wriedt has over 25 years of experience in corporate credit and capital markets, including as chief executive officer of credit fund manager Vibrant Capital Partners (formerly DFG Investment Advisors), which currently has $7.3 billion in assets under management (AUM), co-chief executive officer of credit fund CIFC, which currently has $30 billion in AUM, and as a partner at Golden Tree Asset Management (from 2004 to 2008), which currently has $40 billion in AUM. He is also a member of the board of directors of Cadence Group, Inc., a digital securitization startup, and an investor in Milo, a digital banking startup backed by QED Investors, both of which are 10X Capital portfolio companies. 
 Mr. Kandasamy is currently the chief financial officer of 10X Capital and has over 17 years of financial services, technology, and data science experience at firms including TheNumber, CoreLogic (NYSE: CLGX), Opera Solutions, DBRS Morningstar, SecondMarket (acquired by Nasdaq) and Fannie Mae. He received an MBA in Entrepreneurial Finance from Oxford University in 2010. 
 Our board of directors includes Christopher Jurasek, Boris Silver, and Woodrow H. Levin. Gil Penchina currently serves as a board observer. Each of these individuals possesses significant finance, venture capital, and entrepreneurial experience and business relationship networks that we believe are beneficial to our efforts to identify and consummate an initial business combination. Two of our board members, Messrs. Jurasek and Levin either have been or continue to be board members of companies that have gone public through SPAC business combinations in transactions in which each resulting public company had over $1.0 billion in enterprise value upon the consummation of such transaction. 
 Mr. Jurasek has over 25 years of experience leading global software and industrial technology companies, and is an operating executive at Clearlake Capital, LP. From August 2017 to January 2019, Mr. Jurasek was a member of the board of directors of ConvergeOne, which merged with a SPAC, Forum Merger Corporation, in 2018 in a transaction valuing the company at $1.2 billion. Mr. Jurasek currently serves as chief executive officer of EagleView, one of the leading technology providers of aerial imagery. Mr. Jurasek was also president of aviation technology firm JetSmarter (acquired by Vista Global) and chief executive officer of Calero Software from August 2018 to December 2019 and February 2013 to January 2020, respectively. 
 Boris Silver is a technology entrepreneur and venture capital investor. Mr. Silver is Co-Founder and President of FundersClub Inc. (together with its affiliates and advised funds, FundersClub), a Silicon Valley-based online venture capital platform. FundersClub has invested in companies including Instacart, GitLab, Webflow, and others. FundersClub portfolio companies that have been acquired include Screenhero (acquired by Slack prior to direct listing of Slack (NYSE: WORK)), StatusPage (acquired by Atlassian (Nasdaq: TEAM)), and Second Measure (acquired by Bloomberg). Mr. Silver graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and is also an alumnus of Y Combinator. 
 Mr. Levin served on the board of directors of DraftKings Inc. (Nasdaq: DKNG) which was acquired by a SPAC, Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp, in a transaction valuing the company at $3.3 billion. Mr. Levin is also the founder and chief executive officer of Extend, Inc. and was previously the founder and chief executive officer of Estate Assist, which was acquired by DocuSign (Nasdaq: DOCU). 
 Mr. Penchina is an accomplished venture investor, whose portfolio companies include PayPal, LinkedIn, Fastly, Cruise, Rent the Runway, PagerDuty (NYSE: PD), Discord, Dollar Shave Club, Carta and Wealthfront. Mr. Penchina was part of the pre-IPO team at eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY), where he initially oversaw mergers & acquisitions and then international expansion. Mr. Penchina began his career General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) and Bain & Company. 
 The past performance of our management team or their respective affiliates, including with respect to each of 10X I and 10X III, is not a guarantee of either: (i) success with respect to any business combination we may consummate; or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. No member of our management team has had management experience with special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. You should not rely on the historical record of our management teams or their respective affiliates performance as indicative of any future performance.

 Business Strategy 
 We will seek to capitalize on the significant relationships of Mr. Thomas and our management team, to identify, evaluate and acquire high growth technology and tech-enabled businesses domestically and abroad in the consumer internet, ecommerce, software, healthcare, transportation / mobility and financial services industries, as well as other industries which are being disrupted by advances in technology and on technology paradigms including AI, automation, data science, ecommerce and SaaS. If we elect to pursue an investment outside of those industries, our managements expertise related to those industries may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained herein regarding that industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. 
 Following the Great Recession of 2008, technology companies have experienced a significant increase in private funding, with venture capital backed startups with venture capital backed startups raising $135.8 billion in 2019 up from $37 billion in 2008, or roughly a 267% increase according to the Pitchbook National Venture Capital Association venture monitor. We believe that venture capitalist Marc Andreessens prediction that software will eat the world is coming to fruition. 
 This increase in private funding, however, has not been evenly dispersed, as later stage venture capital firms and growth equity investors have adopted a winner takes all view of private markets. This view is evidenced by the concentrated allocation of a significant amount of capital to a relatively small number of companies, with the top 2% of venture and growth equity backed companies in the first two quarters of 2020 receiving 21% of all funding. This effect is even more pronounced in late stage venture rounds, where 2% of late stage venture-backed companies raised over 46.5% of all capital in the first two quarters of 2020, according to data published by the National Venture Capital Association. 
 We believe that the traditional IPO market is fundamentally underserving the interests of high growth, middle market technology companies. The first day IPO pops of Agora Inc. (Nasdaq: API) (153%), Lemonade Inc. (NYSE: LMND) (139%) and Vroom, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRM) (118%), among others, have supported the notion that despite demonstrable investor demand, the traditional IPO process underprices high growth technology companies. Data compiled by Marker indicates that the average company that went public in 2020 left $110 million on the table. Agora, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: ZI) and Vroom each saw their share prices rise $500 million on the first day, ostensibly leaving much of that appreciation on the table. 
 These combined private and public market factors have led to a proliferation of private companies who face capital and valuation constraints in the private markets, for whom there may be significant investor demand in the public markets, but who may be deterred from utilizing the traditional IPO channel to access more efficient capital. These companies represent a significant and addressable target market for us. We estimate that there are 2,128 current private venture capital and private equity backed companies who would have a potential post-combination enterprise value of $500 million to $3 billion based on the valuation implied at their last round of funding, representing more than $687 billion in combined enterprise value that may be suitable targets for us, according to data from PitchBook Data as of June 30, 2020. 
 Our mission is to create a better solution to the conventional IPO for these high growth, disruptive technology and technology-enabled companies, which addresses their needs for capital and liquidity, while overcoming the key points of friction in the traditional IPO path.

 Business Combination Criteria 
 Although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry, we currently intend to focus our efforts on identifying high growth technology and tech-enabled businesses domestically and abroad in the consumer internet, ecommerce, software, healthcare and financial services industries, as well as other industries which are being disrupted by advances in technology and on technology paradigms including AI, automation, data science, ecommerce and SaaS. 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 

 | Public company-ready: We intend to seek out targets with established governance, financial controls and reporting policies in place, ready to operate in the public markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong Value Proposition for Public Investors: We intend to focus on companies who have a likelihood of being positively received by public company investors, and who may reasonably be expected to have good access to public capital markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion Potential: We intend to seek out companies that possess significant expansion opportunities, which may be facilitated by their status as a public company and access to public capital.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Differentiated product or service: We intend to seek out companies with competitive advantages that can maintain and grow market share against incumbent as well as emerging competitors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Experienced management team: We intend to seek out companies with strong, experienced management teams, or provide a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in the prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 11, 2022 (the prospectus), would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.

 Initial Business Combination 
 NYSE rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted). Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the targets assets or prospects. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the IPO. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the IPO or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in the IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.

 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 Prior to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $253,170,000 (assuming no redemptions), after payment of $14,280,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets 
 We believe our management team is well positioned to identify unique opportunities across the private company landscape in the technology sector. Our selection process will leverage our relationships with leading technology company founders, executives of private and public companies, venture capitalists, private equity and growth equity funds. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm stating that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement units and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. 
 Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business 
 
7 


  as us, and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 In addition, our Sponsor and our officers and directors may Sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. In particular, affiliates of our Sponsor are currently Sponsoring another blank check company, 10X II. 10X II may seek to complete a business combination in any location and is focusing on business combinations in the consumer internet, ecommerce, software, healthcare and financial services industries. Further, Mr. Thomas, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of 10X II. Any such companies, businesses or investments, including 10X II, may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.

 Under NYSEs listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

 | We issue (other than in a public offering for cash) ordinary shares that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of ordinary shares to be issued, or if the number of ordinary shares in which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of ordinary shares or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers and (b) 5% of the number of ordinary shares or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holder; or

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

 Our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.15 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following the closing of the IPO, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder 
 
10 


  approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSEs shareholder approval rules. 
 The requirement that we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and applies whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on the NYSE. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon. 
 If we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a shareholder meeting, we will: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, a quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of ordinary shares of the Company representing at least one-third of the voting power of all outstanding ordinary shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders founder shares and private placement shares, we would need only 9,695,500, or 32.32% of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in the IPO to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). Assuming that only one-third of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, representing a quorum under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, are voted, we will not need any public shares in addition to our founder shares to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have an initial business combination approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a shareholder on the record date for the shareholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. 
 If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
 
11 


 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 We intend to require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to, at the holders option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a public shareholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the scheduled vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public shareholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public shareholders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of the IPO, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements. 
 Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 
12 


 However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights 
 As described above, we intend to require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to, at the holders option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a public shareholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until January 14, 2023. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will have until January 14, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by January 14, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided 
 
13 


  by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by January 14, 2023. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Facilities 
 We currently utilize office space at 1 World Trade Center, 85th Floor, New York, New York 10007 from our Sponsor and the members of our management team. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers: Hans Thomas, David Weisburd, Guhan Kandasamy and Oliver Wriedt. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Available Information 
 We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SECs Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing 1 World Trade Center, 85th Floor, New York, New York 10007 or by telephone at (212) 257-0069.
