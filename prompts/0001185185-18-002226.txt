ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2001, and in 2009 changed our name to Sport Endurance, Inc.
 
Mr. David Lelong has been the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer since February 4, 2016 and the Company’s sole director since April 25, 2016.
 
On March 14, 2018, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Yield Endurance, Inc. (“Yield”), entered into a series of agreements under which Yield borrowed $5 million of bitcoin (“BTC”). The Company simultaneously entered into transactions with Madison Partners LLC and Prism Funding Co. LP to lend the BTC to third parties. On August 21, 2018, the Company entered into a series of restructuring agreements to unwind the BTC transactions thereby exiting the BTC and cryptocurrency markets.
 
Previously, the Company marketed for sale of three sport nutritional products which it suspended when the Company elected to enter into the BTC lending business.
 
The Company is currently seeking to enter into the cannabidiol (“CBD”), hemp, or legal marijuana industries and market various products in one of those industries. As of the date of this report, the Company has no written agreements to acquire any businesses. However, on December 17, 2018,  the Company used a substantial portion of the proceeds from its recent private placement and acquired a minority interest in a privately-held business engaged in the animal health foods business which markets and sells products using marijuana for veterinary medical purposes. We also are engaged in preliminary discussions to acquire that business. We do not have any binding agreements and in any event we would need to complete a large financing. We cannot assure you we will be successful in making any acquisitions.
 
In December 2018 we closed on a private placement where we received approximately $2.8 million before fees from the sale of units of common stock and warrants. As a result of raising this capital we believe that we are in a position to make an acquisition which can deliver shareholder value.
 
Our auditors note that the absence of revenues and operations, in the audit report dated December 21, 2018, is a going concern. The going concern statement opinion issued by the independent auditors is the result of a lack of operations and working capital.
 
The Company cannot pay its short-term debt and will need to raise capital which concerned the independent auditors because there is insufficient cash for operations for the next 12 months.  If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we will cease operations.
