ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, focused primarily on the development of drug therapy for treatment of chronic liver diseases. This therapeutic approach targets fibrosis, inflammation, and shows potential for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), viral hepatitis, and other liver diseases. Our cyclophilin inhibitor, Rencofilstat (formerly CRV431), is being developed to offer benefits to address multiple complex pathologies relate to advanced liver disease. Rencofilstat is a pan cyclophilin inhibitor that targets multiple pathologic pathways involved in the progression of liver disease. Preclinical studies with Rencofilstat in NASH models demonstrated consistent reductions in liver fibrosis and additional reductions in inflammation and cancerous tumors in some studies. Rencofilstat additionally showed in vitro antiviral activity towards hepatitis B, C, and D viruses which also trigger liver disease. Preclinical studies also have shown potentially therapeutic activities of Rencofilstat in experimental models of acute lung injury, platelet activation, and SARS-CoV-2 replication.
We have completed a Phase 1 program with Rencofilstat in healthy subjects demonstrating tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Our program consisted of three different clinical trials with Rencofilstat, administered orally once daily, that included: 1) a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study; 2) a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study; and 3) a Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) study. The SAD, MAD, and DDI studies were comprised of 32, 25, and 18 healthy subjects, respectively. Additionally, in the SAD study, 8 of the 32 subjects received placebo (24 received Rencofilstat).
Rencofilstat appeared to be well-tolerated in the Phase 1 program, and there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. The few adverse events (AEs) observed were mild to moderate and mostly unrelated to study drug. The PK profile of each subject was characterized and Rencofilstat blood exposures were similar to those levels needed to elicit efficacy in the preclinical studies.
We also have recently completed a Phase 2a, multi-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled, once-daily study in NASH induced fibrosis 2 and 3, or F2/F3 subjects. All of the primary objectives for the study were met, including safety, tolerability, and PK endpoints. In addition, a number of NASH biomarkers, collagen degradation proteins, and transcriptomics were also collected and indicated early evidence of Rencofilstat efficacy in these NASH subjects. Based on screening procedures including laboratory (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), imaging (FibroScan), and biomarkers (Pro-C3, ELF score), 47 presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects were enrolled into the trial and included in the safety date set. An initial low dose cohort of 75 mg or matching placebo was enrolled, and subjects were followed for 28 days on treatment with a 14-day safety follow-up observation period. A second high dose cohort was then initiated, and subjects were either enrolled on 225 mg of Rencofilstat or matching placebo and were followed for the same 28 days on treatment and 14-day safety follow up observation period. All subjects were dosed in the trial and included in the safety evaluation, with 12 subjects completing in the 75 mg cohort, 17 subjects completing at 225 mg, and 14 matching placebo subjects completing. Three subjects in the 75 mg cohort and 1 subject on placebo terminated the trial before completion. Rencofilstat reported a dose response by reducing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels at 28 days as well as improving biomarkers currently used as non-invasive means of evaluating antifibrotic effect, including PRO-C3. With active daily dosing of 28 days and a subsequent 14-day follow up, Rencofilstat was well tolerated in NASH subjects with no SAEs or deaths reported.
Building on the results of the Phase 2a study in NASH subjects, a Phase 2b, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Rencofilstat in adult subjects with NASH and advanced liver fibrosis is expected to begin in 2022. This Phase 2b clinical study in 336 biopsy confirmed F2/F3 NASH subjects will increase the understanding of three doses of Rencofilstat on multiple clinically relevant endpoints and biomarkers related to improvements in or halting the advancement of further hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. The trial design will closely follow current FDA guidance on the development of NASH therapeutic agents, as the primary endpoint will be based on changes in paired liver biopsy samples after one year of three active drug doses versus matched placebo. 
NASH is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by inflammation and fibrosis (scarring) in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. The prevalence of NAFLD, which affects approximately 25% of the global population, and NASH, which develops in approximately 20% to 25% of NAFLD patients, is growing and is driven primarily by the worldwide obesity epidemic. Patients with NASH frequently have other significant metabolic co-morbidities such as obesity, high blood sugar, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, and systemic hypertension (a constellation commonly referred to as metabolic syndrome), and these further contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease. The number of NASH cases in the US is projected to expand from 16.5 million in 2015 to 27 million in 2030, with similar prevalence growth expected in Europe. Diet and exercise are currently the standard of care for NAFLD and NASH, but adherence is poor, and there remains a high unmet need in the treatment of NASH.
NASH is the form of liver disease that is triggered by what has come to be known as the “Western diet”, characterized especially by high-fat, high-sugar, and processed foods. Among the effects of a prolonged Western diet is fat accumulation in liver cells (steatosis) which is described as NAFLD and can predispose cells to injury. NAFLD may evolve into NASH when the fatty liver begins to progress through stages of cell injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. People who develop NASH often have additional predisposing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, but the exact biochemical events that trigger and maintain the progression are not well known. Many people in the early stages of disease do not have significant clinical symptoms and therefore do not know that they have it. NASH becomes evident and a major concern when the liver becomes fibrotic and puts the individual at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and other complications. Individuals with advanced liver fibrosis have significantly higher risk of developing liver cancer, although cancer may also arise in some patients before significant hepatitis or fibrosis. NASH is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate due to the spread of the Western diet, obesity, and other related conditions. Approximately 4-5% of the global population is estimated to have NASH, including the USA. NASH is the most common reason for individuals requiring a liver transplant in the USA. Considering the serious outcomes linked to advancing NASH, the economic and social burden of the disease is enormous. There are no simple blood tests to diagnose or track the progression of NASH, and no drugs are approved to specifically treat the disease.
HCC is the major type of liver cancer, accounting for 85-90% of all cases. NASH, hepatitis virus infection, and alcohol consumption all are major causes of HCC. Globally, over 700,000 people die each year from liver cancer which is second only to lung cancer among all cancer-related deaths. The high mortality is due, in part, to the fact that only around half of all people who develop HCC (in developed countries) receive the diagnosis early enough to have an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, recurrence rates are high, and current treatment options remain limited.
HCC is a type of cancer in which the tissue microenvironment plays a major role in its development. In most cases, HCC is preceded by significant, long-term damage to liver cells, inflammation and fibrosis. One-third of people with cirrhosis, a very advanced stage of liver disease, will eventually progress to HCC. The chronic injury to the liver leads to many genetic mutations that eventually lead to transformation of cells and formation of tumors. The noxious tissue microenvironment also promotes cancer by altering the function of immune cells and endothelial cells which form tumor-supporting blood vessels. These various events underscore the importance of preventing or slowing liver injury and scarring as early and effectively as possible in order to decrease the progression of liver cancer.
Viral hepatitis may be linked to one or more viruses including hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. Hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) is one of many hepatitis viruses that selectively infect human liver cells and can establish persistent infections under certain conditions. Chronic infections, especially by HBV, HCV, and HDV, cause progressive liver inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. Collectively, these infections represent one of the 3 major triggers of progressive liver disease (NAFLD/NASH and alcohol being the others).
An HBV vaccine is available that, if administered prior to HBV infection, assists the body in neutralizing the virus and blocking infection. However, vaccination is not efficacious for people who are already infected with HBV, and the vaccine has not been historically available to everyone. As a result, an estimated 240 million people worldwide have chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBV medications are used widely by chronically infected individuals but usually are only effective in decreasing viral replication and viremia (virus in the blood), and NOT in eradicating HBV from the liver. This is because HBV, unlike HCV, has evolved clever ways of persisting in liver cells and evading the immune system. Thus, despite vaccines and anti-viral medications, chronic HBV infection remains a huge global health problem. Chronic HBV infection results in the deaths of approximately 350,000 people per year. A similar number of people die each year from cirrhosis and other complications arising from HBV.
Rencofilstat
We are developing Rencofilstat as our lead molecule. Rencofilstat is a compound that binds and inhibits the function of a specific class of isomerase enzymes called cyclophilins that mainly regulate protein folding. Many closely related isoforms of cyclophilins exist in humans. Cyclophilins A, B, and D are the best characterized cyclophilin isoforms. Inhibition of cyclophilins has been shown in the scientific literature to have therapeutic effects in a variety of experimental models, including liver disease models. In preclinical in vitro and/or in vivo experiments to date Rencofilstat decreased liver fibrosis, liver inflammation, liver tumors, and titers of HBV, HCV, HDV, and HIV-1. Importantly, reduction in liver fibrosis by Rencofilstat was observed in vivo in several experimental models and studies of NASH and liver fibrosis. Findings to date suggest that Rencofilstat might treat certain inciting agents of liver disease such as hepatitis viruses and also the ensuing disease processes resulting from those agents such as fibrosis.
Cyclophilins are pleiotropic enzymes that play a role in injury and steatosis through mechanisms including cell death occurring through mitochondrial pore permeability (cyclophilin D). Inhibition of cyclophilin D, therefore, may play an important role in protection from cell death. Cyclophilin A binding to CD147 is known to play a role in inflammation, cyclophilin B plays a role in fibrosis through collagen production, and cyclophilins also play a role in cirrhosis and cancer (e.g., 
cell proliferation and metastasis). Cyclophilin inhibition with Rencofilstat, therefore, may play an important role in reducing liver disease.
To date, we have completed a number of separate preclinical animal efficacy studies of Rencofilstat to assess antifibrotic activity. These studies were conducted by independent laboratory collaborations at, for example, The Scripps Research Institute (San Diego, CA), SMC Corporation (Tokyo, Japan), and Physiogenex S.A.S. (France), Each of these studies demonstrated consistent and significant reductions in fibrosis in mice and rats. Rencofilstat was also tested in ex vivo Precision Cut Liver Slices and in Precision Cut Lung Slices obtained from human donors. Again, Rencofilstat demonstrated an antifibrotic effect in the human tissue that was consistent with the animal study findings. These studies provide support of advancing Rencofilstat into clinical trials for NASH, and potentially additional indications where fibrosis plays a role.
Many viruses have been shown to recruit cellular (“host”) cyclophilins into the life cycles of the viruses and therefore assist in viral replication and evasion of host immunity. These viruses include HBV, HCV, HDV, HIV-1 and several coronaviruses. Rencofilstat was found in in vitro experiments to decrease replication of HBV, HCV, HDV, HIV-1, and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection may, in some instances, be associated with acute lung injury and platelet-mediated thrombotic disorders. In experimental models, Rencofilstat decreased acute lung inflammation and platelet activation, and therefore Rencofilstat may have therapeutic benefits in COVID-19 patients.
Data in various cell lines of either transfected or infected HBV demonstrates nanomolar efficacy (EC50 values) and micromolar toxicity (CC50 values). The selective index (“SI”), therefore, is wide and suggests that Rencofilstat presents a viable clinical drug candidate for the treatment of viral infections, including HBV. Additional testing in a transgenic mouse model of HBV indicated that Rencofilstat reduced HBV DNA in the liver and HBsAg in serum. Rencofilstat is orally active and appears to be well tolerated.
On May 10, 2018, we submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to support initiation of our Rencofilstat HBV clinical development program in the United States and received approval in June 2018. We completed the first segment of our Phase 1 clinical activities for Rencofilstat in October 2018 wherein we reached a major clinical milestone of positive data from a Phase I trial of Rencofilstat in humans. This achievement triggered the first milestone payment, as stated in the May 26, 2016 acquisition agreement between the Company and Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ciclofilin”) (the “Merger Agreement") for the acquisition of Ciclofilin and we paid a related milestone payment of approximately $0.3 million to Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Aurinia") and $0.7 million to the former Ciclofilin shareholders along with the issuance of 1,439 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $0.1 million, representing 2.5% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of June, 2016, to the former Ciclofilin shareholders. Our CEO is a former Ciclofilin shareholder and received approximately $0.3 million and 603 shares of common stock and Petrus Wijngaard, a director of our company, received $2,805 and 6 shares of common stock. 
Additional milestone payments could potentially be payable to the former Ciclofilin shareholders pursuant to the Ciclofilin Merger Agreement as follows: (i) upon receipt of Phase II positive data from a proof of concept clinical trial of Rencofilstat in humans - 4,317 shares of common stock and $3.0 million, (ii) upon initiation of a Phase III trial of Rencofilstat - $5.0 million, and (iii) upon acceptance by the FDA of a new drug application for Rencofilstat - $8.0 million. In addition, on February 14, 2014, Ciclofilin had entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Aurinia’s entire interest in Rencofilstat. This agreement contains future milestone payments payable by us based on clinical and marketing milestones of up to CAD $2.5 million. The milestone payments payable to the former Ciclofilin shareholders will be subject to offset by certain of the clinical and marketing milestone payments payable to Aurinia as follows: (a) the payments to the former Ciclofilin shareholders pursuant to (ii) above would be offset by payment to Aurinia of CAD $0.5 million, and (b) the payments to the former Ciclofilin shareholders pursuant to (iii) above would be subject to offset by payment to Aurinia of up to CAD $2.0 million. In addition to the above clinical and milestone payments, the Aurinia Agreement provides for the following additional contingent payment obligations: (x) a royalty of 2.5% on net sales of Rencofilstat which is uncapped, (y) a royalty of 5.0% on license revenue from Rencofilstat and (z) a payment equal to 30.0% of the proceeds from a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with respect to Ciclofilin, of which approximately $0.2 million plus interest will be paid to Aurinia. The maximum obligation under both (y) and (z) is CAD $5.0 million. 
The Merger Agreement was amended on January 14, 2022 primarily for the following: (i) upon receipt of Phase II positive data from the first Phase II clinical trial of Rencofilstat in NASH patients which has been achieved: (1) such number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of our common stock equal to 7.5% of the issued and outstanding of our common stock on the Closing Date as defined in the original agreement, which were issued in March 2022, and (2) a payment of $2.0 million to Ciclofilin shareholders, including a payment to our CEO of $0.8 million and other Hepion employees of $0.2 million, which such payment being made in January 2022, (ii) a payment of $1.0 million upon the positive read out of the first planned interim futility analysis of a Phase IIb clinical trial of Rencofilstat in NASH patients, supporting the continuation of the Phase IIb trial, (iii) a payment of $5.0 million upon initiation of the first Phase III trial of Rencofilstat in patients, where initiation occurs with first patient in the study dosed with study medication, (iv) a payment of $5.0 million upon the filing and 
acceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the first new drug application for CPI-431-32; and (v) a payment of $8.0 million upon the regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the first new drug application for Rencofilstat.
On June 17, 2019, we submitted an IND to the FDA to support initiation of our Rencofilstat NASH clinical development program in the United States and received approval in July 2019. We completed dosing of Rencofilstat in our multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial in September 2020.
On November 20, 2020, we submitted an IND to the FDA to support initiation of a Rencofilstat clinical development program in the United States for COVID-19. We received approval December 17, 2020, to conduct a COVID-19 clinical trial and are investigating potential sources of collaboration and/or funding for the trial.
On November 19, 2021, we submitted an IND to the FDA to support initiation of a Rencofilstat clinical development program in the United States for the treatment of HCC and received approval on December 17, 2021. 
On November 30, 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for our lead drug candidate, Rencofilstat, for the treatment of NASH. The FDA Fast Track designation allows sponsors to gain access to expedited drug approval reviews for medical conditions that are serious and potentially life-threatening, and where there is an unmet medical need. The program is also designed to facilitate drug development by making provisions for more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss drug development plans, and Fast Track designation can lead to Accelerated Approval and/or Priority Review eligibility if certain criteria are met. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
We have created a proprietary AI tool called, “AI-POWR™ to optimize the outcomes of our current clinical programs and to potentially identify novel indications for Rencofilstat and possibly identify new targets and new drug molecules to broaden our pipeline.
AI-POWR™ is our acronym for Artificial Intelligence - Precision Medicine; Omics that include genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics; World database access; and Response and clinical outcomes. AI-POWR™ allows for the selection of novel drug targets, biomarkers, and appropriate patient populations. AI-POWR™ is used to identify responders from big data sources using our multi-omics approach, while modelling inputs and scenarios to increase response rates. The components of AI-POWR™ include access to publicly available databases, and in-house genomic and multi-omic big data, processed via machine learning algorithms. We believe AI outputs will allow for improved response outcomes through enhanced patient selection, biomarker selection and drug target selection. We believe AI outputs will help identify responders a priori and reduce the need for large sample sizes through study design enrichment.
We intend to use AI-POWR™ to help identify which NASH patients will best respond to Rencofilstat. It is anticipated that applying this proprietary platform to our drug development program will ultimately save time, resources, and money. In so doing, we believe that AI-POWR™ is a risk-mitigation strategy that should reap benefits all the way through from clinical trials to commercialization. The AI-POWR™ platform is continually updated with in-house and published data to further refine the accuracy of the neural network. 
We believe that NASH is a heterogenous disease and we need to have a better understanding of interactions among proteins, genes, lipids, metabolites, and other disease variables to help predict disease progression, regression, and responses to Rencofilstat. All of this is further complicated by variable drug concentrations, patient traits and temporal factors. AI-POWR™ is designed to address many of the typical challenges in drug development, as we believe we can use our proprietary platform to shorten development timelines and increase the delta between placebo and treatment groups. AI-POWR™ will be used to drive our ongoing Phase 2a NASH program and identify additional potential indications for Rencofilstat to expand our footprint in the cyclophilin inhibition therapeutic space.
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary intellectual rights are crucial in our business and establishing and maintaining these rights are essential to justify the development of our product candidate. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection for our inventions and rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage for our product candidate. In order to protect these rights, know-how and trade secrets, we typically require employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us, generally stating that they will not disclose any confidential information about us to third parties for a certain period of time and will otherwise not use confidential information for anyone’s benefit but ours.
As patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy until patents are published or issued, unless earlier publication is required under applicable law or in connection with patents filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) or as publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, we cannot be certain 
that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions described in our pending patent applications or that we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, and therefore, the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability cannot be predicted.
Pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, patents filed on or after June 8, 1995 have a term of 20 years from the date of filing, somewhat irrespective of the period of time it may take for the patent to ultimately issue. This may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to our products as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, a sponsor may obtain marketing data exclusivity for a period of time following FDA approval of certain drug applications, regardless of patent status, if the drug is a new chemical entity or if new clinical studies were used to support the marketing application for the drug. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 also allows a patent owner to obtain an extension of applicable patent terms for a period equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding New Drug Application (“NDA”) plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval, with a five-year maximum patent extension. We cannot be sure that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing data exclusivity provisions of this law.
On June 13, 2016 we completed our merger with Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“CPI”) acquiring all its outstanding equity interests. Ciclofilin’s lead asset, CPI-431-32, which we renamed Rencofilstat, strengthens our liver disease portfolio and is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of liver fibrosis and in development against hepatitis B virus (HBV). On February 14, 2014, CPI, through its wholly owned subsidiary, had entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Aurinia”) entire interest in Rencofilstat. There was no upfront consideration. There are future milestone payments of up to CAD $2.9 million, which are to be paid within 30 days of achieving such milestone. In addition to the milestone payments, future payment obligations (in Canadian Dollars “CAD”) include a royalty of 2.5% of net sales. The amount payable under the foregoing royalty obligation is uncapped.
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot give assurance that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees, and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets and other proprietary rights or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable in terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Sales and Marketing
We currently do not have any commercialization or sales and marketing capabilities, and currently have no plans to invest in or build such capabilities internally. Currently, we anticipate partnering or collaborating with, or licensing certain rights to, other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the development of our antiviral product candidate through late-stage clinical development and, if successful, commercialization. However, we may decide not to license any development and commercialization rights to our product candidate in the future.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any facilities in which we can formulate and manufacture our product candidates. We intend to rely on contract manufacturers to produce all materials required to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), with management and oversight of these activities by our management team. We have identified alternate sources of supply and other contract manufacturers that can produce materials for our preclinical and clinical 
trial requirements on a timely basis. However, if an existing or future contract manufacture fails to deliver on schedule, or at all, it could delay or interrupt the development process for our product candidate and affect our operating results and estimated timelines.
We currently use contract manufacturers to produce clinical trial material for use in the clinical trials of Rencofilstat.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and most foreign markets, any revenue associated with the sale of our product candidate, if approved for sale, will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include various government health authorities such as The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which administers Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., managed-care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including pharmaceuticals. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products. Our products may ultimately not be considered cost-effective, and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to support a profitable operation or generate an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The U.S. and foreign governments periodically propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare and pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our product candidate is ever approved for sale. In addition, the adoption of new legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. Further, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. The marketability of our products may suffer if the government and other third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidate.
We, and our existing collaborators, intend to obtain coverage and reimbursement from these third-party payers for any of our products that may be approved for sale; however, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining adequate coverage, reimbursement, or pricing, if any.
Regulatory Matters
Overview
The preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, sale, export, reporting and record-keeping of drug products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA and corresponding state agencies, and regulatory agencies in foreign countries.
Non-compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of the clinical development of a product candidate, manufacturing and marketing, failure of the FDA or similar regulatory agency in other countries to grant marketing approval, withdrawal of marketing approvals, fines, injunctions, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.
U.S. Regulatory Approval
Pursuant to FDA regulations, we are required to successfully undertake a long and rigorous development process before our product candidate can be marketed or sold in the U.S. This regulatory process typically includes the following steps:
•the completion of satisfactory preclinical studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
•the submission and acceptance of an IND that must be reviewed by the FDA or Clinical Trial Application that must be reviewed by similar regulatory agencies in other countries and become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•obtaining the approval of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee, or EC, at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials;
•the successful completion of a series of adequate and well- controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, efficacy and purity of any product candidate for its intended use, which conform to the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations;
•the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes that conform to FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs; and
•the submission to, and review and approval by, the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or a Biologic License Application, or BLA, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product.
Successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources. We cannot assure you that this process will result in the granting of an approval for our product candidate on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will have sufficient financial resources to see the process for our product candidate through to completion.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies generally include laboratory, or in vitro, evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability, and toxicity, as well as certain in vivo animal studies to assess a product’s potential safety and biologic activity. We must submit the results of these preclinical studies, together with other information, including manufacturing records, analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must be reviewed and become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials. An IND generally becomes effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within this 30-day time period, raises material concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. If our product candidate is placed on clinical hold, we may be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the FDA before we could begin, or continue, clinical trials of such product candidate. Preclinical studies supportive of an IND generally take a year or more to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing human clinical testing to begin.
Certain preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring such studies to be conducted again.
Clinical Trials
This clinical trial phase of drug development follows a successful IND submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, efficacy and dosage of an investigational new drug substance in humans, as well as the ability to produce the drug substance in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the activity or efficacy of the product candidate. Each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND prior to beginning the trial. Each trial and the clinical protocol must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB and, with limited exceptions, requires the patient’s informed consent to participate in the trial. Sponsors, investigators, and IRBs also must satisfy extensive GCPs, including regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and reporting any serious adverse events on a timely basis. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk.
Clinical trials to support an NDA or BLA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases: Phase 1, 2 and 3, with Phase 4 clinical trials often conducted after marketing approval has been granted. The FDA may require sponsors to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials to study certain safety issues or other patient populations. Data from these activities are compiled in an NDA or a BLA for submission to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug. These phases may be compressed, may overlap, or may be omitted in some circumstances.
•Phase 1: After an IND becomes effective, Phase 1 human clinical trials can begin. A product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or in some cases, patients with the medical condition for which the product candidate is intended to be used. Generally, the purpose of a Phase 1 trial is to assess a product candidate’s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate it at different dose levels. Absorption, metabolism, distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage. Phase 1 trials typically evaluate these aspects of the investigational drug in both single doses, as well as multiple doses.
•Phase 2: During Phase 2 clinical trials, a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dose tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial. Phase 2 trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate, and a control group that is not treated with the product candidate but either receives a placebo or a drug already on the market for the same indication. Typically, two or more Phase 2 studies will be conducted for a product candidate prior to advancing to Phase 3.
•Phase 3: If and when one or more Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile, one or more Phase 3 trials may be undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of the investigational drug in an expanded patient population, with the goal of evaluating its overall risk-benefit relationship. Phase 3 trials are generally designed to 
reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate’s clinical efficacy. The successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more Phase 3 trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate.
In the case of product candidates being developed for serious or life- threatening diseases, such as HBV, Phase 1 trials may be conducted in patients with the respective disease rather than in healthy volunteers. These studies may provide initial evidence of activity or efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase II clinical trials, and therefore these trials may be referred to as Phase 1/2 or Phase 1b clinical trials.
A company may request an “end-of-Phase 2 Meeting” with the FDA to assess the safety of the dose regimen to be studied in the Phase 3 clinical trial, to evaluate the planned design of a Phase 3 trial, and to identify any additional information that will be needed to support a NDA. If a Phase 3 clinical trial has been the subject of discussion at an “end- of-Phase 2 Meeting,” the trial sponsor may be eligible for a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), by the FDA, a process by which the FDA, at the request of the sponsor, will evaluate the trial protocol and issues relating to the protocol within 45 days to assess whether it is deemed to be adequate to meet the scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor. If the FDA and the sponsor reach agreement on the design and size of a Phase 3 clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA or BLA, the FDA may reduce the understanding to writing. The SPA, however, is not a guarantee of product approval by the FDA, or approval of any permissible claims about the product.
Throughout the various phases of clinical development, samples of the product candidate made in different batches are tested for stability to establish any shelf-life constraints. In addition, large-scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed. Phase 1, 2, and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical development that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate further evaluation or trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the subject or patient. The FDA, the sponsor, or an IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk. The FDA can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval or advancement to the next stage of development. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of products under development. Furthermore, IRBs, which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects in the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted, have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety issues. A Data Safety Monitoring Board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk.
Clinical trials performed outside the U.S. under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies conducted in the U.S. The FDA may accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well- designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects.
Certain information about clinical trials, including a description of the study, participation criteria, location of study sites, and contact information, is required to be sent to the National Institutes of Health, (“NIH”) for inclusion in a publicly-accessible database that is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 directed the FDA to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the NIH the results of all controlled clinical studies, other than Phase 1 studies.
New Drug and Biologics License Applications
If and when we believe that all the requisite clinical trials for a product candidate have been completed with satisfactory and supporting clinical data, we must submit a NDA or BLA to the FDA in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate in the U.S. Among many other items, an NDA or BLA typically includes the results of all preclinical and toxicology studies and human clinical trials and a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods. The FDA must approve the NDA or BLA prior to the marketing and sale of the related product. The FDA may deny an NDA or BLA if it believes all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional data, including clinical, toxicology, safety or manufacturing data prior to approval. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for a substantive review before accepting it for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be amended with the additional information. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other 
experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
An NDA or BLA can receive either standard or priority review. A product candidate representing a potentially significant improvement in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a life threatening or serious disease may receive a priority review. In addition, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may also receive accelerated approval on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing Phase 4 clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the approval process.
If the results of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA, and inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical sites are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
If the FDA determines that it cannot approve the application in its present form, it generally issues what is referred to as a complete response letter. A complete response letter will describe all the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA. If and when those conditions are met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically re-review the application and possibly issue an approval letter. However, even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. It can take several years for the FDA to approve an NDA or BLA once it is submitted, and the actual time required for any product candidate to be approved may vary substantially, depending upon the nature, complexity and novelty of the product candidate.
We cannot assure you that the FDA, or any other similar regulatory agency in another country, will grant approval for our product candidate on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
Post-Approval Regulations
If and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval to be marketed and sold, the approval is typically limited to a specific clinical indication or use. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers, will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities for our current and future product candidates, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing of such product candidate, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals.
If the FDA approves our product candidate, we, or our collaborators if applicable, and our contract manufacturers must provide the FDA with certain updated safety, efficacy and manufacturing information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs, or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the formulation and manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct.
The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of an approved drug or biologic product must also comply with FDA and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by 
these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
The FDA’s policies may change in the future and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidate. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad, or the impact such changes could have on our business.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and in some circumstances the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulatory Approval
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
•Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
•For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
•National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
