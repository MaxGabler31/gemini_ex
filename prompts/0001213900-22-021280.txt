ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Cruzani, Inc. (“Cruzani” or the “Company”) was most recently a franchise development company that builds and represents popular franchise concepts, and other related businesses, throughout the United States as well as international markets. The Company is currently evaluating various new business models. The Company was originally formed as a limited liability company on February 5, 1999 under the name The Powerhouse, L.L.C. pursuant to the laws of the State of Oklahoma. On November 9, 2006, Powerhouse Productions, L.L.C. filed Articles of Conversion changing the entity from a limited liability company to a corporation under the name Harcom Productions, Inc. On January 25, 2010, Articles of Merger were filed with the State of Oklahoma merging U.S. Highland, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation into Harcom Productions, Inc. and the name of the corporation was changed to US Highland, Inc. US Highland, Inc. was a recreational power sports Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”), developing motorcycles, quads, single cylinder engines, and v-twin engines under its own brand and for other OEMs. During 2017, the Company exited the recreational power sports OEM and leisure activity vehicles markets.



On June 29, 2018, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada to change its name to Cruzani, Inc. The name change is subject to approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as “FINRA”).



On June 30, 2018, Supreme Sweets Acquisition Corp. (n/k/a Oventa, Inc.), a subsidiary of the Company, and the Company (collectively, the “Company”) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Supreme Sweets Inc. and 2498411 Ontario, Inc., as sellers (collectively, the “Seller”), pursuant to which in exchange for CAD $200,000 and a twenty percent (20%) interest in Oventa, Inc., the Company agreed to acquire the trade secret assets of Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. A second closing occurred on July 31, 2018, pursuant to which the Company acquired the furniture, fixtures and equipment of Seller in exchange for CAD $100,000. Seller is engaged in the business of preparing delicious snacks, pastries and baked goods with high quality ingredients for exceptional taste, including low calorie and gluten-free alternatives. The Asset Purchase Agreement included a provision, pursuant to which the Company could unwind the transaction if certain milestones were not achieved. The milestones contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement were not met, and accordingly, effective on December 31, 2018, by written notice to the Seller, the Company unwound the transaction. The capital injected into Oventa, Inc., however, has been secured pursuant to financing statements filed on behalf of the Company, and the Company expects to receive a return of its injected capital during the calendar year 2019. Subsequent to the December 31 notification, the parties searched for a resolution in an effort to salvage the transaction. In early February, however, it was determined that there wasn’t an acceptable path forward. At that time, the company filed a Form 8-K regarding the matter.



On September 27, 2018, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Sandrea Gibson, as seller (the “Seller”), and Recipe Food Co., as the target (the “Target”), pursuant to which in exchange for up to CAD $237,000, the Company agreed to acquire 80% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Target from the Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Seller is engaged in the business of preparing and serving delicious, healthy meals on a counter-service basis with high quality ingredients, including low calorie alternatives. Difficulties integrating the Target into the Company group, forced the Company to cease injecting additional capital into the Target. The Target is currently on the market for disposition to a third-party buyer on an arms-length basis.



On July 8, 2019, Mr. Dickson entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with Conrad Huss to sell 5,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred and 5,000 shares of Series B preferred Stock held by Mr. Dickson. As a result, Mr. Huss acquired the right to vote 99.06 % of the voting control of the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock is also convertible into common stock which, in the aggregate, would represent up to .01% of the outstanding common stock after the conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock is also convertible into common stock which, in the aggregate, would represent up to 99.05% of the outstanding common stock after the conversion.



On July 8, 2019, Everett Dickson, who had been the sole officer of the Company, resigned as an officer of the Company, and Conrad Huss was appointed the Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Huss is the sole beneficial owner of 5,000,000 and 5,000 shares of Series B and C Preferred Stocks, respectively. Mr. Dickson also resigned as a director of the Company, effective on July 8th, 2019. Mr. Dickson’s resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the management of the Company.
