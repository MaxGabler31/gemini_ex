BUSINESS
Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks. Our products address the highest speed over distance applications and are designed for 100G and beyond data rates, such as at 200G, 400G and 600G on a single wavelength, for telecom and hyper-scale data center or content provider networks.  
Our High Speed Products for data rates of 100G and beyond comprised 86% of our revenues in 2018 and were 83% of our 2017 revenue. These Products use our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology and are the core focus of our strategy. We believe that they are an important competitive differentiator as networks for data centers and telecom carriers increasingly demand higher data rates in their operating systems. 
Our High Speed Products include transceiver modules, optical components and high speed chip-level optical devices. Our 100G and beyond transceiver module products incorporate our vertically integrated, high performance components, including ultra-narrow linewidth tunable lasers (NLW-TLs), high bandwidth coherent receivers (ICRs), high bandwidth micro-modulators (micro-MOD), high bandwidth trans-impedance amplifiers (TIAs) and high bandwidth laser and modulator drivers. We integrate several of these components into a Coherent Optical Subassembly (COSA) which when combined with our NLW Laser, provides all of the optical functions necessary for coherent communications in an ultra-compact package suitable for next generations of pluggable modules. In addition to integrating these components into our own modules, we sell these components to other industry leaders who use them in their highest performance products. We believe that our strength in these and other high performance components places us in a strong competitive position as volumes grow and as we add new variants to our module product line.
100G and beyond networks have adopted coherent transmission technology to increase data rates and thereby lower costs. These high speed networks are one of the highest growth segments of the optical communications market, and support the rapid per bit expansion of telecom backbone, hyper-scale data center and content provider networks, accommodating increased mobile traffic. Prior to 2016, revenue growth from our high speed products was mainly driven by the adoption of our 100G coherent products in the Long Haul market sector.  We expect our future growth in the 100G and beyond segment to be driven primarily by the increased adoption of our high speed products in the much larger Metro market sector and in the high-speed data center

interconnect, or DCI, market as well as the optical interconnection market within large hyper-scale data centers. Products for data rates of 400G and above accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2018 and are among our fastest growing product groups.
Coherent transmission uses not only amplitude but also phase and polarization properties of light to increase data rates ten-fold or more over conventional “on-off” transmission protocols.  Coherent transmission can flexibly and efficiently switch signals on individual wavelengths without conflict or contention between wavelengths, a feature that is required for Software Defined Optical Networks, or SDON. Software Defined Optical Networks markedly increase the flexibility and efficiency of Metro networks and, combined with the ten-fold increase in data-rates achievable with coherent transmission, mark a very large improvement in cost performance for metro scale networks.  In addition, the necessary equipment to implement a metro scale network is significantly reduced, especially by using flex-coherent transceivers and CDC Switches. 
The benefits of coherent transmission have made it a preferred technology for advanced high speed telecommunications networks for distances of 80 kilometers to 2000 kilometers.  We believe that our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology enables us to effectively address the challenges inherent in precision and high volume manufacturing of optical components for coherent transmission. 
Our products also serve high performance, non-coherent segments of the data center and enterprise market which require the fastest speeds transmitted over relatively long distances within hyper-scale data centers. We are a leading provider of electro-absorptively modulated lasers ("EMLs"), receiver photodiodes, plus laser driver and receiver amplifier ICs. In addition, we design and manufacture laser light sources in our Indium Phosphide wafer fabs for Silicon Photonics-based short reach interconnects within the data center. 
Our revenue over the last several years reflects the rapid adoption and deployment of high speed 100G above networks across the global telecom and data center network applications. 
Our leading customers serve the telecom market and also the hyper-scale data center market, represented by companies including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Large network equipment and optical module companies, together with emerging content providers and data center operators, are the focus of our strategy due to their important positions in high speed and related communications networks markets.
We sell our products to the world’s leading network equipment manufacturers, including Ciena Corporation, or Ciena, Cisco Systems, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., or Huawei and Nokia Corporation, or Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent S.A., or Alcatel-Lucent, which was acquired by Nokia in January 2016). These four companies accounted for approximately 78% and 65% of our total revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other leading customers are FiberHome Telecommunications Technologies Co., Ltd., or FiberHome, a major Chinese telecommunications system provider, and Acacia Communications, Inc., or Acacia, a fast growing vendor of optical interconnects. 
We believe our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology is well positioned to serve the highest speed next-generation 200G, 400G and 600G products and applications. Using this core technology we produce photonic integrated circuits, or PICs, that comprise both arrayed and individual photonic functional elements using optimized materials systems and processes from our in-house Silicon, Indium Phosphide and Gallium Arsenide wafer fabrication, plus Silicon Germanium and Silicon Photonics chips produced in external foundries. These individual PICs from different materials are then combined using our hybrid integration technology to make complete products, such as our Integrated Coherent Receiver (“ICR”), our ultra-narrow linewidth tunable laser, our Multi-cast Switch (“MCS”) for 100G and beyond coherent transport and Metro applications, our 100G and above CFPx transceivers for data center interconnect and telecom client networks, and our 64 Giga-baud ("GBaud") ICR and Indium Phosphide Micro-Modulator with an integrated driver for 400G and above applications. 
High Speed 100G and beyond coherent technology has become widely used in the Long Haul market segment over the last several years, but is now increasingly being deployed in the much larger Metro and the emerging data center interconnect, or DCI, sectors of the market.  While the cost per port deployed typically declines every year due to technological advances, 100G and beyond coherent port demand represents a high growth opportunity for suppliers of components, modules and systems for the 100G coherent Metro and DCI markets.  In addition, Metro coherent ports include ports that have “flex coherent” features, which can be used not only in the Metro market but also in the Long Haul market and therefore have to support the highest performance applications at deployment. 
Our products for the rapidly growing coherent Metro market include ICR, ultra-narrow linewidth tunable lasers, CDM micro-modulators and MCS. Our multi-cast switches similarly are used by hyper-scale content providers for software definition of their network configuration.  Also, we produce coherent transceiver modules that are used for the Metro market as well as the data center interconnect market, such as our high speed coherent CFP-DCO transceivers.

We design and manufacture a range of semiconductor laser and control IC products that are used in client-side telecommunications transmission and in single mode interconnections in hyper-scale data center applications. We additionally sell laser products that are specifically optimized for use with Silicon Photonics based interconnects and for longer distance and high data rate interconnects.
We further design and manufacture a broad range of products for optical communications networks and a variety of other applications, where the networks operate at speeds less than 100G. These products are key elements of direct detect long haul and metro DWDM networks as well as mobile backhaul and fronthaul networks that include application-specific passive optical functionalities in modules or subsystem configurations. These products include athermal arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG)-based modules for multiplexing and demultiplexing in conventional ROADM nodes as well as variable optical attenuators and tap power monitors for network monitoring and control. In addition, many of these products provide high-bandwidth connections to base station antennas for mobile devices.
We have strengthened our technology leadership through several strategic acquisitions, listed below. 

• | In January 2015, we acquired the ultra-narrow linewidth tunable laser business of EMCORE Corporation’s (EMCORE), expanding our position as a supplier of tunable laser for coherent communications. The EMCORE ultra narrow linewidth tunable laser products are used in the industry’s highest speed applications and are critical components that are used with our highest speed and highest bandwidth receiver products for the emerging data rates of 400G and 600G.


• | In March 2013, we acquired the optical component business unit of LAPIS Semiconductor Co., Ltd., located in Japan, now known as NeoPhotonics Semiconductor. This business is a leading producer of high performance communications lasers, photodiode devices and optical control electronic devices which enable our leading market positions and increasing vertical integration in our coherent products including ultra-narrow linewidth tunable lasers and coherent receivers. NeoPhotonics Semiconductor also produces high speed lasers and control semiconductors for high speed data center and client side applications, providing vertical integration for our high speed telecom client side and data center module products and stand-alone products to the industry.


• | In October 2011, we acquired Santur Corporation, or Santur, a producer of tunable lasers and modulators for coherent transmission and of 100G client side transceiver modules. Santur’s capabilities included array distributed feedback ("DFB") lasers and photonic integration of lasers, modulators and photodiode elements.

In December 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain assets of our access and low speed transceiver product lines (the “Low Speed Transceiver Products”) to APAT Optoelectronics Components Co., Ltd. (“APAT OE”) of Shenzhen, China. In January 2017, we closed the sale of these assets which generated approximately 1%, 15% and 27% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All of these product lines were part of our Network Products and Solutions group and include the low speed passive optical network, or PON, products for which the end-of-life plan was announced in mid-2016.
We have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing. We believe we are one of the highest volume manufacturers of photonic integrated circuits ("PIC") in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs.

Industry Background
 In today's hyper connected world we rely more and more on seamless access to massive amounts of data, including everything from video entertainment to tele-medicine, security sensing, autonomous vehicles and virtual reality. More and more optic data traffic is in the background between machines. This new era of connectedness is increasingly universal and demands that the capacity of the digital communications networks must increase exponentially. Smartphones and related portable devices have emerged as the preferred vehicle connecting the digital world, such that today there are more than 20 billion connected devices and machine learning and artificial intelligence will continue to accelerate this trend. Not only are more people connected to the mobile web, but they are connecting at increasingly higher data rates and requiring higher bandwidths. Wireless network deployments have progressed from third generation (3G) to fourth generation (4G/LTE) and deploying fifth generation (5G), representing a 10X increase in bandwidth over five years, and providing end-users with ever-increasing download speeds and mobility, and enabling IoT machine-to-machine communication for the integration of autonomous vehicles and virtual reality applications. 
Further, the deployment of modern communications has rapidly expanded from being the domain of telecom service providers to include today’s deployments by enterprises, content providers and merchant data storage and service “mega” data center enterprises.  The rapid rise of internet traffic that is going through mega data centers operated primarily by leading content companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft (i.e. Microsoft Azure), has emerged as the largest part of this rapidly growing new market for optical modules and components and more specifically for high speed optical modules and components. 
The revolution in the power of low cost computing devices is associated with an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every two years since their invention and a prediction that this trend would continue. In the domain of optical communications, a similar revolution, progressing at a similar rate, is driven by the increased speed, smaller size and lower cost achieved by photonic integration. 
A single optical fiber can carry 100 or more individual wavelengths (colors), each of which can now support 400 gigabits per second or more of data traffic capacity. Each of these wavelengths requires a 400G or higher speed transmitter and receiver, which can be tuned to any of the 80 separate channels. Thus, using 400G coherent technology and industry standard compression (MPEG-2), a single fiber can transmit more than 30 trillion bits per second, which represents more than 8 million high definition movies streaming simultaneously. 
Digital Optical Communications Market Structure
The digital optical communications market has two main sectors, telecom (which is sub divided into Long Haul, Metro and access applications) and Datacom (which includes data centers). The telecom sector includes the global backbone of Long Haul and Metro communications. It also includes local access links to end users. The Datacom and data center sector includes connections in hyper-scale data centers as well as traditional “enterprise” networks. As data centers proliferate within metropolitan sized geographies, a very rapidly growing Data Center Interconnect (DCI) market has emerged which resembles the metro market in its bandwidth and distance needs and utilizes similar optical technologies and products.  
While the Metro market is the largest volume, it most often follows the Long Haul telecom sector in technology deployment, notably of coherent 100G and beyond technologies. The Long Haul telecom sector is the first adopter of the highest speed and most advanced communication links, and typically long haul technology migrates over time into the Metro sector as costs are reduced such that they are economical in the shorter but more numerous Metro network links, with its commensurate lower traffic densities prior to aggregation for Long Haul transport.
The Datacom market includes hyper-scale data centers and infrastructure for cloud based services as well as traditional enterprise networks. Companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are steadily increasing investments in very large data centers as they implement cloud-based “big data” services that can be crowd-sourced and crowd-distributed, and that utilize machine-to-machine and inter-data center transactions to power the mobile web.  Connections between such very large data centers over a metro-sized area are an emerging high growth market for “big pipes” using dedicated 100G and beyond digital optical connections from data center to data center (DCI). Connections within data centers (intra-data center) and from data center to a telecommunications carrier are also moving to 100G and beyond speeds, although somewhat behind Metro, DCI and long haul. In recent years the surging demands of these hyper-scale datacenters have begun to drive communication technology developments such that the highest speed links are now often deployed first in DCI applications and only later utilized in Long Haul and Metro networks. 400Gbps is now widely deployed in DCI and systems with 600Gbps and 1.2Tbps are beginning to appear.

Connections within data centers (intra-data center) and from data center to a telecommunications carrier are also moving to 100G and beyond speeds
From this market structure, we believe that a technology leader must now achieve a leadership position in the DCI data center interconnect sector as well as the Long Haul telecom sector as the basis for commercializing the most advanced technology and then extending that technology to additional network segments. 
Digital Optical Communications Network Equipment
The structure of the industry that supplies the network equipment for telecom and data center interconnect (DCI) digital optical communications networks has largely concentrated down to leading vendors which include: Ciena, Cisco, Fujitsu Networks, Fiberhome, Huawei, Infinera Corporation, NEC Corporation, Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent, which was acquired by Nokia in January 2016) and ZTE Corporation. 
Major suppliers of network equipment to the Datacom and data center market include Arista Networks, Cisco, Huawei, Infinera and Juniper Networks and Nokia. At the optical module and component level, Broadcom Limited, or Broadcom (resulting from the acquisition of Broadcom Corporation by Avago Technologies Ltd., or Avago), Finisar and Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations, Inc., or Sumitomo, are leading merchant suppliers and some larger network equipment companies like Huawei and Cisco have divisions or affiliates (such as HiSilicon in the case of Huawei) that are captive suppliers. Furthermore, some of the larger hyper-scale content providers, such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook, are beginning to design and source their own optical network systems equipment from contract manufacturing partners. These moves drive “disaggregation” in the data center network separating software and hardware elements, as well as different hardware functions, so that multiple vendors can supply different interacting products. 
Recent changes in switch architectures are rapidly moving new installations to higher speed 100G dataflows (using PAM4, or Pulse Amplitude Modulation signal encoding), resulting in a fast growing 100G, 200G and 400G module market for connections inside the data center and “big pipes” for data connections between data centers, or data center interconnects (DCI), at 100G, 200G, 400G and 600G data rates.
The main photonic operational blocks or components required for digital optical communications are transmitters, receivers and, where the network is branched, optical switches. Transmitters and receivers are often combined into single modules which are called transceivers and can be configured into line cards, daughter cards and transponders, or digital or analog modules. At the high end, such as Long Haul, a transmitter and receiver can be paired and combined with signal processing electronics to error correct and restore degradation which affects the signal after traveling long distances, in which case the unit is referred to as a transponder. For high speeds and high bandwidth each of these product types requires photonic integration at the most advanced and complete level to deliver the required performance and functionality while being manufacturable at scale and competitive in cost. 
Switching products, which switch different colors, or signal channels, down different branches of the network, have thus far been Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs) consisting of Wavelength Selective Switches (WSSs). For 100G and above coherent networks, a new type of optical switch, the Multi-Cast Switch (MCS), has been developed and introduced to eliminate contention in 100G coherent switching. The need to eliminate contention is being driven by the move to SDON, which is important to both telecom network requirements and content provider networks.  A “contentionless” architecture uses both traditional “Wavelength Selective Switches” and the new MCS, which we supply.  One or more MCSs are deployed initially with each ROADM node, and then additional multicast switches are deployed over time as traffic growth demands with as many as eight MCS devices for each node, allowing networks to efficiently expand as needed. This type of switch is Colorless, Directionless and Contentionless, or CDC, and its function is optimized for 100G and beyond coherent networks. 
Digital Optical Communications Technology Background
Advances in cost performance in photonic integration have followed a path that has been similar to electronic integrated circuits.
The main objectives for technology advances in electronic digital integrated circuits and in integrated optical digital devices are similar, and are based on the drive towards lower cost and higher performance with expanding scale. In integrated optics these main objectives also include higher speed, lower power, smaller or denser form factor, and lower cost. 
10

In both electronics and optics these objectives require ever increasing integration and miniaturization. In optics, however, we believe advanced hybrid integration is required for the highest performance products. Hybrid integration for digital optical devices incorporates multiple types of materials substrates, rather than just one, as in silicon for an electronic integrated circuit. 
Complete advanced photonics integration capability requires at least three materials substrate systems: Indium Phosphide for active devices such as lasers, photodiode detectors, modulators, and amplifiers; Silicon or planar doped silicon dioxide (silica) for wave guides, filters, interferometers and other passive devices; and Gallium Arsenide or Silicon Germanium for drivers and control functions at the speeds necessary for 100G. The integration of more than one material substrate is called hybrid integration, and Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration enables products in the 100G and beyond domain. 
Advantages and Challenges of Coherent Transmission
Coherent digital optical transmission technology has increased the native capacity of a fiber optic link tenfold, versus a transmission modulation of simple on/off such as in 10G WDM networks. Coherent transmission modulation encodes information via phase and polarization, and the permutations of these variables are many times greater than on/off. 
To create a detectable error-free signal in the coherent modality requires that each color (wavelength) transmitted be much purer than would be required for lower speed protocols. The primary enabler of such ultra-narrow line width (NLW), that is, an ultra-pure and stable color, is a new generation of the most advanced lasers. These NLW lasers must be paired with a new generation of receivers that decode phase and polarization through comparison with another NLW laser in a PIC-interferometer. Ultra-narrow line width lasers are built on Indium Phosphide substrates while the receivers utilize a Silicon or Indium Phosphide interferometer and Indium Phosphide or Germanium photo detectors. 
These 100G and beyond coherent optical transmission devices require tighter tolerances of material thickness and other critical dimensions than do components operating at 10G. For 100G, a new generation of technologies, including faster Gallium Arsenide drivers, is required to suitably process transmission signals in both the laser transmitter and the detector and receiver. As transmission speeds move to 200G, 400G and even 600G through higher order modulation protocols and higher symbol rates, even higher performance optical components are required.  We believe we have established and characterized the full range of driver, laser and detector technologies required for implementing 100G, 200G, 400G and 600G coherent systems, a capability that we believe is held by only a few companies. 
Our Core Technology and Hybrid Photonic Integration Platform
We have core technology capabilities in optoelectronics that enable the high speed, high bandwidth, high performance optoelectronics products and we believe we have developed or acquired all necessary capabilities required for producing high performance Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integrated optoelectronic devices for the most stringent performance requirements and operating conditions. Our core technology leverages a unique multi-material platform that includes: 
Indium Phosphide (InP): Indium Phosphide is used to produce efficient lasers, sensitive photo detectors and modulators in the wavelength window typically used for telecommunications, i.e. 1.55 micron wavelengths, as it is a direct bandgap III-V compound semiconductor material. InP is the most important material for the generation of laser signals and the detection and conversion of those signals back to electronic form.
Silicon (Silicon Photonics and Planar Lightwave Circuits): Silicon is a multi-attribute material that is efficient for electronics and versatile for integration while being very inefficient in generating or detecting light in the telecom wavelength window as it is an indirect bandgap semiconductor material. Consequently, waveguides of Silicon or doped Silicon Dioxide (silica) exhibit very low optical loss and are ideal for switching, filtering or interferometric applications and active elements including modulators and switches for full transmit and receive functions are produced using Silicon waveguides. 
Gallium Arsenide (GaAs): Gallium Arsenide can operate at very high speeds and is well suited to make analog integrated circuit drivers for high speed lasers and modulators due to its high electron mobility. GaAs is a direct bandgap III-V compound semiconductor material, but unlike InP, GaAs does not lase in the telecom wavelength window. 
Silicon Germanium (SiGe): Silicon Germanium is an alloy of Silicon and Germanium that is used to manufacture mixed signal and analog integrated circuits and is well suited for high speed amplifiers used in 100G systems. SiGe devices are made using standard silicon processing techniques in commercial foundries. 
ASIC Development:  We have applied in-house capability for customized integrated circuit design and development for specific purpose applications in high speed optical digital control and management, including certain developments in signal processing.  Such products are deployed in GaAs, SiGe and silicon materials platforms. 
11

We have developed design, integration and manufacturing approaches and techniques to produce advanced, high speed integrated solutions leveraging each of these in-house materials technology and high speed digital optoelectronics platforms.

Our Technology
We have developed expertise in the design, large-scale fabrication, high-volume module manufacturing and commercial deployment of high speed digital optics and signal processing products that are based on our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration products and technologies. The process of designing and manufacturing advanced optoelectronic integrated devices in high volume with predictable, well-characterized performance and low manufacturing costs is complex and multi-faceted. We have developed the technologies using multiple materials platforms for photonic integration that are required to design and manufacture complex, high-performance optoelectronic components, modules and subsystems for fiber optic networks. The basic elements of our technology are as follows: 
Mixed-material platform and optoelectronic integration technology. We utilize a set of proprietary integration platforms that provide optoelectronic functionality on Silicon and other integrated compound semiconductor substrates including Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide and Silicon Germanium and integrated combinations of these platforms.
We utilize micron and sub-micron scale structures of multiple, Silicon, Silicon Dioxide and Indium Phosphide waveguides to fabricate optoelectronic functional elements such as lasers, detectors, modulators, interferometers, integrated optical filters, switches and variable attenuators. We integrate these functional design elements into optoelectronic devices to achieve a desired functionality and specification that is incorporated into our products. Similarly, we use Gallium Arsenide and Silicon Germanium integration platforms for drivers, amplifiers and related high-speed electronic control functions for our integrated optoelectronic devices. 
Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration. Through precise fabrication and positioning of physical features, we can integrate numerous different optoelectronic devices, which are fabricated on separate wafers from different semiconductor and related materials, matching the material to the function to create improved performance by using the highest performance elements of each type. For example, our hybrid integration allows us to integrate active devices, such as photodiodes or lasers fabricated using Indium Phosphide, with high-performance passive devices, such as interferometers, switches, routers and filters, fabricated on Silicon, and to mate electronic amplifiers made with Silicon Germanium or drivers made with Gallium Arsenide directly to optical elements made with Silicon or Indium Phosphide. 
This ability to combine specific functional elements out of optimized materials not only allows for very compact and low power components, but also through the intimate coupling of different elements, makes possible completely new functions. An example of this multi-platform architecture is found in the coherent optical communications domain where we intimately couple a passive interferometer with separate quadrature components carrying information and with photo detectors to turn a high speed optical signal into data-rich electrical signals for processing. 
Optoelectronic engineering and integration. As we create complex integrated optoelectronic devices, we design and build electronic control algorithms and devices, signal processing methodologies, hardware and software routines and protocols, and device level ASICs that function to control and manage the highest performance features and capabilities of these integrated optoelectronics devices and systems. For example, our digital and analog modules are carefully characterized and controlled to extend and deliver their full operating ranges and performance features enables by their Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration platform.
Hardware and firmware integration. We also sell our products as modules and subsystems which contain electronic hardware and firmware controls that interface directly with our customers’ systems. We design the electronic hardware and develop the firmware for control of our optical products and subsystems, and so that our optical products meet customer specifications. 
13

Devices, Components, Modules & Subsystems. We are vertically integrated from the design of photonic integrated devices through manufacturing in our own wafer fabs and assembly and test in our own factories. We design and manufacture modules and subsystems that combine our key products with other elements to offer customers a complete solution. We sell products at each level of product utility and can achieve the highest performance and capture the greatest value. We utilize some contract manufacturers for assembly operations where it is cost effective. 
Fabrication and manufacturing processes. We have developed expertise in the technology domains relevant to high-volume fabrication and manufacturing of our optoelectronic integrated circuit products using wafer-scale processes and including the complex interaction of electro-optic, thermal-optic and mechanical micro-thermal features. Our complex manufacturing steps are analogous to many processes used in the semiconductor industry. Each integrated element is tested and characterized using our proprietary test equipment before incorporation into our products. Moreover, the ability to assemble complete optoelectronic devices, modules and systems with full control of performance and fabrication from the semiconductor and optical device level through to its optoelectronic controls to its pluggable module form factor enables delivery of the highest performance, highest scale and lowest cost solutions required by the industry. 
Circuit design and design-for-manufacturing tools. We use a comprehensive set of proprietary as well as industry standard software design tools, to model relevant geometries, dimensions and thermal management for a broad range of photonic devices. With these tools, we develop products with minimal design iterations and manage precision manufacturing to a narrow range of high performance specifications.
Our Products
We develop and manufacture Transmitter Products, Receiver Products and Switch Products that are used in ultra-high speed digital optical and signal processing communications, high speed switching and provisioning. We combine our transmitter and receiver products into Transceiver modules. Our Switching Products, such as Multi-Cast Switches, are used primarily in ROADM nodes that dynamically and efficiently allocate bandwidth to adjust for fast changing traffic patterns and for provisioning software defined optical networks. Our products can be categorized into groups, including High Speed Products for 100G, 200G, 400G, 600G and beyond applications, including in coherent networks, and Network Products and Solutions, for lower speed networks and other passive telecom and instrumentation products. 
High Speed Products: We produce transmitter and receiver products as well as switching products for 100G and beyond optical transmission applications over distances of 2 to 2,000 kilometers. In addition, we combine 100G and beyond transmitter and receiver products into pluggable modules for line side coherent and transmission applications. We have also integrated transmitter and receiver functions into a single integrated component called a COSA (Coherent Optical Sub Assembly), which has an ultra-small form factor designed to fit into the next generation pluggable transceivers. All of our high speed 100G and beyond products are based on our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology. This technology supports encoding 100 gigabits or more per second of information for transmitting over a single channel and decoding the information at the receiver, as well as enabling smaller, more compact and more highly integrated designs for the individual elements and integrated COSAs. 
For Long Haul, Metro and DCI transport, we design and manufacture optical components for coherent systems, which manipulate light to encode ten times or more the amount of information in the same wavelength channel than is possible with traditional methods. This manipulation can only be accomplished using advanced photonic integration to intimately couple functional elements together. Our Coherent Products include Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable transmit and local oscillator lasers (NLW-TL), which generate the ultra-pure wavelength, or color, necessary for coherent transmission, coherent micro-modulators which encode the information on the intensity and phase of the optical beam and Integrated Coherent Receivers (ICRs), which decode the phase and polarization encoded coherent signal. 
We have introduced new pluggable coherent modules which combine our NLW-ITLA with our ICR and, in some cases with our high performance coherent modulator such as in our CFPx-DCO transceiver and transponder optical modules.  The design for interoperability of each of the constituent elements of such a precise high speed device is a core capability that continues to fuel our ability to develop and deliver device and module products that achieve the highest performance available globally. 
We also sell 100G products for the client side and data center applications, including 26 GBaud EMLs, laser drivers, modulator drivers and photodiode receivers for 100G and beyond client side applications. 
Further, we are shipping an ultra-high-speed 53 GBaud EML and driver IC sets that enable single wavelength PAM4 100G applications and subsequently four wavelength 400G intra-data center transmission. 
14

For hyper-scale data center applications we have introduced a series of high power laser diode array products for short reach Silicon Photonics based 100G intra-data center interconnections which use parallel single-mode architectures, or PSM4, as well as coarse wavelength division multiplexing, or CWDM architectures. These are additionally designed for use in DR1, DR4 and FR4 Silicon Photonics-based transceivers. 
We provide a proprietary switching solution for 100G coherent systems embodied in our Multi-Cast Switch (MCS) product line. Our 4x16, 8x16 and 12x16 Multi-Cast Switch modules for CDC ROADMs efficiently allocate bandwidth and signal routing in 100G and higher data rate networks. The Multi-Cast Switch provides scalable contentionless operation to achieve the highest traffic management efficiency, optimizing traffic flows in coherent transmission systems. Our MCS uses our PLC photonic integration platform and consists of a complex array of switches, waveguides, taps, crossings and other functional elements manufactured on Silicon wafers using standard semiconductor processing equipment. Our PLC technology exhibits very low loss and enables the extension of the Multi-Cast Switch to be extended to higher port count NxM configurations.

Network Products and Solutions: We design and manufacture products for optical communications networks and a variety of other applications, where the networks operate at speeds less than 100G. We offer a wide range of application-specific passive optical functionalities in modules or sub-system configurations. These include arrayed waveguide grating based drop modules for multiplexing and demultiplexing in conventional ROADM nodes as well as variable optical attenuators and tap power monitors for network monitoring and control. We combine several of these functions together in subsystems such as our variable multiplexer, which combines up to 48 variable optical attenuators and an arrayed waveguide grating multiplexer in a single compact unit.  In addition, many of these products provide high-bandwidth connections to base station antennas for mobile devices and to people and machines over fixed and wireless networks. As consumer connectivity speeds have increased through the transitions from 2G to 3G to 4G/LTE and moving to 5G, the bandwidths necessary to aggregate and connect wireless traffic into the backbone network, including Mobile BackHaul, have also increased. We offer laser drivers, modulator drivers, photodiode receivers and trans-impedance amplifiers for these applications. 
15

Through 2016 we also offered transceiver modules for low speed Access and Mobile Backhaul applications, including GPON and GEPON transceiver products at up to 10G data rates, plus specialty transceiver products. The Low Speed Transceiver Products’ assets were sold to APAT OE in January 2017, and are no longer included among our products. 
In addition to products for fiber optic communications, we also sell products for test and measurement, instrumentation, industrial and research applications. 
Our Infrastructure, Intellectual Properties and Our Employees
We have product development and product sustaining engineering teams in Silicon Valley (San Jose and Fremont, California), Tokyo, Japan and Shenzhen and Wuhan, China. In our Silicon Valley and Tokyo facilities we conduct research, product development and product roadmap definitions, including for our PIC products. In our Shenzhen facilities, we conduct new product development, manufacturing and process engineering, quality control, continuous improvement and cost reduction relating to product manufacturing, assembly and test. In our Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada facilities we conduct new device, component and product development. 
We seek to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights and trade secret laws. We have filed applications for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, China, Russia, India, Taiwan and several European Union countries. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 541 issued patents, expiring between 2019 and 2037 covering various aspects of our technologies. 
We have manufacturing operations in the U.S., Japan, China and Russia. Our wafer fabrication operations are located in our San Jose and Fremont, California facilities, as well as in our Japan facilities, and include chip design, clean room fabrication, integration and related facilities for PICs. Our manufacturing, assembly and test operations are located in our Shenzhen and Dongguan, China facilities, and in Silicon Valley, California. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,769 employees and non-employee contractors, of which 297 were based in the U.S., 1,316 in China, 137 in Japan, 10 in Russia and Europe and 9 in Canada.
None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Chinese law allows that all employees be members of a union that is overseen by the Chinese government. The majority of the employees in our Japanese subsidiary are also members of a union. We have not experienced employment-related work stoppages and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
Our Customers
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our five largest customers accounted for 87%, 78% and 82% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2018, customers of 10% or more revenue were Huawei, together with its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd. (collectively “Huawei”), and Ciena Corporation, which accounted for 46% and 24% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2017, customers of 10% or more revenue were Huawei and Ciena Corporation, which accounted for 40% and 16% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2016, Huawei and Ciena Corporation accounted for 50% and 15% of our total revenue, respectively.
Our Sales and Marketing
We operate a sales model that focuses on alignment with our customers through coordination of our sales, product application engineering and manufacturing teams. Our sales cycles typically require a significant amount of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of products. The length of our sales cycle, from initial request to design win, is typically 6 to 12 months for an existing product and 12 to 18 months or longer for a new product. 
We use a global direct sales force based in North America, Europe and Asia, including China and Japan. These individuals work with our product application engineers, and product marketing and sales operations teams, in an integrated approach to address our customers’ current and future needs. We have very deep technical relationships.  We believe that these collaborative engineering activities provide us insight into our customers’ broader and longer-term needs. We view our technical sales capability and our technical relationships with customers as a key part of our value delivery to our key strategic customers. 
Our marketing team focuses on product strategy, product development, roadmap development, new product introduction processes, program management, product demand stimulation and assessment, and competitive analysis. Our marketing team also seeks to educate the market about our products by communicating the value proposition and product differentiation in direct customer interactions and presentations and at industry tradeshows and at technical conferences. It is important that these 
16

teams are engaged in both industry forums such as MSA (multi supplier agreement) Committees, etc. as well as direct customer and end-user engagements.
Our Research and Development
We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital into our research and development operations. Research and development expenses were $53.8 million, $58.3 million and $57.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Our research and development activities continue to push the performance leadership boundaries in high speed digital optics, hybrid optical integration, optoelectronics control and in signal processing. 
Our Suppliers
We use suppliers from the U.S., China, Japan and other locations. Although there are multiple sources for most of the component parts of our products, some components are sourced from single or, in some cases, limited sources, which can increase risks of materials availability for production. We typically do not have written agreements with the majority of these component manufacturers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products. We also use contract manufacturers in Japan, China and other Asia locations for the back-end manufacturing of certain of our products. 
As the industry scales the entire supply chain is working to scale.  As a result, we work closely with our key suppliers to understand their business as we grow together.  This requires our continuing close management. 
Our Backlog
Sales of our products generally are made pursuant to purchase orders, often with short lead times. These purchase orders are typically made without deposits and may be subject to revision or cancellation. The quantities actually purchased by our customers, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised to reflect changes in our customers’ needs and in our supply of products. 
Certain of our customers use vendor managed inventory (VMI) arrangements under which we manufacture at a customer’s request, then ship to its facility or a designated contract manufacturer for the customer, to be held until it is used by the customer. We maintain title to vendor managed inventory until the customer uses the inventory. At that time the customer takes title to the products, it reports the consumption to us and we recognize the revenue for the product sale. The increased use of VMI by our customers may increase the possibility of changes to our backlog since customers may consume VMI more quickly or more slowly than we had planned.
Our direct sales force works our customers in an integrated approach to understand current and future needs.  Because we operate a sales model that focuses on alignment with our customers there is the possibility of changes in delivery or acceptance schedules, cancellations, modifications or price reductions with limited or no penalties and the use by customers of VMI is increasing, we do not believe that backlog is a firm or reliable indicator of our future revenue and do not rely on backlog to manage our business or evaluate our performance. Changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales. 
Seasonality
Historically, our first quarter revenue is generally seasonally lower than the rest of the year primarily due to lower capacity utilization during the annual new year holidays in China and the impact of typical price negotiations conducted at the end of each calendar year and impacting shipments during this period. This historical pattern is important in recognizing the typical annual distribution of revenue from quarter to quarter through the year.  That said, our first quarter revenue varies markedly year to year so should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance.
Financial Information by Geographic Region
17

For information regarding our revenue and property, plant and equipment by geographic region, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks relating to our operations see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and particularly the risks under the caption “Risks related to our operations in China” and the risk factors “Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Japanese Yen (JPY) exchange rates”, “We face a variety of risks associated with international sales and operations, which if not adequately managed could adversely affect our business and financial results” and “We are subject to global governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability, impair our ability to compete in international markets or restrict our sales to certain customers.”
Competition
The market for optical communications systems is highly competitive. While no single company competes with us across all of our product areas, our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are: 

• | ability to provide leading edge technologies for high speed communications;


• | ability to design and manufacture high quality, reliable products, including customized solutions;


• | breadth of product solutions;


• | price to performance characteristics;


• | ability to quickly and consistently produce in high volume and high quality;


• | ability to meet customers’ specific requirements;


• | ability to meet customer lead time demands;


• | financial stability; and


• | depth of relationships with and proximity to key customers globally.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We believe our principal competitors include: 

• | Furukawa Co., Ltd., Fujitsu Optical Components Limited, NTT Electronics Corporation, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd ("SEI"), Finisar, Lumentum Holdings Inc. (formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation) and others in Coherent products;


• | Accelink Technologies Co., Ltd., Broadcom (formerly Avago), Finisar, InnoLight Technology Corporation, M/A-Com, Inc, Source Photonics, Inc., Sumitomo Electric Industries and others in Data center and Client side products;


• | Lumentum and NTT Electronics Corporation in switching; and


• | Lumentum, NTT Electronics Corporation, M/A-Com, Inc., Sumitomo Electric Industries and others in Network Products and Solutions.

Our competitors may have substantially greater name recognition and technical, financial and marketing resources than we do. Many of our competitors have greater resources to develop products or pursue acquisitions, and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these products and technologies than we do. In addition, a number of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively and which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
We also face competition from some of our customers, including Huawei and its affiliate, HiSilicon, who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally. These customers may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge as a result of their higher levels of integration. As a result, these customers may purchase less of our products and there would be additional pressure to lower our selling prices which, accordingly, would negatively impact our revenue and gross margin.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our research and development and manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations govern, among other things, the discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination; the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials; employee health and safety; and the hazardous material content and recycling of our products. We use, store and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations and as components in our products. We incur costs to comply with existing environmental, health and safety requirements, and any failure to comply, or the identification of contamination for which we are found liable, could cause us to incur additional costs, including cleanup costs, monetary fines, or civil or criminal penalties, or result in the curtailment of our operations. In addition, environmental, health and safety requirements have become more stringent over time, and changes to existing requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, or cause us to incur other significant expenses or to modify our manufacturing processes or the contents of our products. Some jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products have enacted requirements regarding the recycling of waste electronic equipment, and/or the packaging and hazardous material content of certain products. For example, jurisdictions including China and the European Union, among a growing number of jurisdictions, have placed restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects the composition and packaging of our products. The passage of such requirements in additional jurisdictions, or the tightening of standards or elimination of certain exemptions in jurisdictions where our products are already subject to such requirements, could cause us to incur significant expenditures to make our products compliant with new requirements, or could limit the markets into which we may sell our products. 
Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHG, may also impact us. For example, our semiconductor manufacturing operations in California use perfluorocarbons, which are classified as a high global warming potential greenhouse gas. Under California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, we designed and installed additional pollution control equipment at our San Jose, California, manufacturing plant to reduce our perfluorocarbon emissions beginning in 2012. Since the end of 2012, our San Jose and Fremont, California, manufacturing facilities have maintained compliance with the Global Warming Solutions Act through the monitoring and reviewing of our Greenhouse Gas Emissions including permits issued locally by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and we have submitted reports annually to verify such compliance. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a finding relating to GHG emissions that may result in promulgation of federal GHG air quality standards that could also affect us.
