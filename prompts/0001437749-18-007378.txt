Network Media Streaming and Digital Signage:
 
Our network media streaming products are primarily sold under VIEW™ and VIEW Pro brands deliver the ultimate IP A/V experience by streaming time sensitive high definition audio and video and control over TCP/IP networks. By combining audio and/or video content, meta-data and control signals into one digital stream in harmony with industry standards, its distributed, edge of the network architecture allows the hardware and the processing power to be distributed across any existing TCP/IP network. This leverages many of the advantages of using TCP/IP over traditional analog systems and other centrally controlled IP-based systems. The ClearOne VIEW and VIEW Pro products are powered by ClearOne’s patented StreamNet® technology. A user can activate and control a single audio source or combination of audio sources, video sources, security systems, HVAC systems, lighting, and other room or facility monitoring functions such as paging or security access by just a single touch to its attractive touch screens. Alternatively, any PC, laptop, tablet, iPod, or other device with a built-in web browser with Flash can control the equipment connected to the system. The VIEW and VIEW Pro systems have no limits on the numbers of sources, displays, or amplifiers in a project and can be used in venues from high-end residential homes to large-scale commercial projects. The number of devices could be determined by the network bandwidth availability, number of media streams and its bandwidth requirements.
 
Converting an audio or video signal to TCP/IP preserves the digital quality of the signal across the network. Unlike analog systems, which lose quality over long distances, TCP/IP packets are decoded to retain the same digital quality as contained when they were encoded. The addition of Digital Encoder and Digital Decoder products with DVI/HDMI input and output enhances the flexibility of complete AV distribution system and makes it as easy to use as analog devices.
 
VIEW Pro solution provides 1080p60, H.264 high definition HDMI video-audio, 4:4:4 true-color, 24 bit per pixel video output. It comes with dual inputs encoder, single input encoder and single output decoder with balanced audio, general purpose control ports and clock synchronized video output. VIEW Pro system also provides PANORAMATM , a multi-view video composition and video-wall software application using its built-in video processing engine, without using external expensive hardware video processors. This continues to be truly differentiated in the professional market by offering complete AV streaming and distribution systems that can scale to fulfill projects of any size and complexity, from light commercial to the very largest environments. VIEW Pro products include E110 and E120 encoders and D110, D210 and D310 decoders. VIEW Pro solution also comes with multiple license options including audio mixing, video composition, video wall, multicast RTSP and local playback.
 
During the second quarter of 2016, we introduced the new VIEW CONSOLE configuration management software. This software gives integrators a comprehensive platform from which to configure, manage, monitor, and control VIEW system installation using an easy, modern interface. The new toolset, which spotlights the latest in advanced software development technologies, works across ClearOne’s full line of VIEW/VIEW Pro products. In 2017, we released an updated version of VIEW CONSOLE and PANORAMA software applications.
 
At the end of May 2016, we introduced a new flexible and single-channel-priced VIEW® Pro E110 Encoder — designed for single-media input settings. E110 Encoder delivers high-quality video with configurable 4:4:4 and 4:2:0 color sampling; standards-based streaming formats; 1080p60, H.264-based, high-profile encoding with lossless compression; very low end-to-end latency; and full HDCP support. We also introduced the innovative new entry-level VIEW Pro D310 Decoder featuring all the basic functionality to fully satisfy simple applications while delivering superb price-to-performance value. D310 Decoder features convenience in its small footprint and easy mounting behind any display. It delivers full-screen, single-image video; high-quality video with 4:2:0 video color sampling; and 1080p60, H.264-based high-profile decoding with lossless compression.

MARKETING AND SALES
 
We primarily use a two-tier channel model through which we sell our commercial products to a worldwide network of independent professional audiovisual, information technology and telecommunications distributors, who then sell our products to independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, who in turn work directly with the end-users of our products for product fulfillment and installation, if needed. Our products are also specified and recommended by professional audio-video consultants. We also sell our commercial products directly to certain dealers, systems integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users.
 
Our product sales generated in the United States and outside the United States for the years ended December 31 are as follows:
 

Revenue in millions | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
----------------------+---------+------+------+-----+--------
 | Revenue | | % | | Revenue | | % | Revenue | | | % | 
In the United States | $ | 24.6 | | 59 | % | $ | 31.8 | | 65 | % | | $ | 39.6 | 68 | %
Outside United States | $ | 17.2 | | 41 | % | $ | 16.8 | | 35 | % | | $ | 18.2 | 32 | %
 | $ | 41.8 | | 100 | % | $ | 48.6 | | 100 | % | | $ | 57.8 | 100 | %

 
We sell directly to our distributors, resellers and end-users in approximately 61 countries worldwide. We anticipate that the portion of our total product revenue from international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue as we further enhance our focus on developing new products, establishing new channel partners, strengthening our presence in key growth areas, complying with regional environmental regulatory standards, and improving product localization with country-specific product documentation and marketing materials.
 
Distributors, Resellers and Independent Integrators
 
We sold our products directly to approximately 378 distributors and direct resellers throughout the world during 2017. Distributors and resellers purchase our products at a discount from list price and resell them worldwide to hundreds of independent systems integrators, telephony value-added resellers, IT value-added resellers, and PC dealers on a non-exclusive basis. Our distributors maintain their own inventory and accounts receivable and are required to provide technical and non-technical support for our products to the next level of distribution participants. We work with our distributors and resellers to establish appropriate inventory stocking levels. We also work with our distributors and resellers to maintain relationships with our existing systems integrators, dealers, and other value-added resellers.
 
While dealers, resellers, and system integrators all sell our products directly to the end-users, system integrators typically add significant value to each sale by combining our products with products from other manufacturers as part of an integrated system solution. Commercial dealers and value-added resellers usually purchase our products from distributors and may bundle our products with products from other manufacturers for resale to the end-user. We maintain close working relationships with all our reseller partners and offer them education and training on all of our products.
 
Marketing
 
Much of our marketing effort is conducted in conjunction with our channel partners who provide leverage for us in reaching existing and prospective customers worldwide. We also regularly attend industry forums and exhibit our products at multiple regional and international trade shows, often with our channel partners. These trade shows provide exposure for our brand and products to a wide audience. We market our ClearOne-branded commercial products on our website www.clearone.com. We also conduct public relations initiatives to get press coverage and product reviews in industry and non-industry publications alike.
Customers
 
We do not get comprehensive reports from our distributors and resellers that identify our end-users. As a result, we do not know whether any end-user accounted for more than 10 percent of our total revenue during any of the periods reported in this Annual Report. However, revenues included sales to Starin Marketing, which represented approximately 16% of consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 with no other customer accounting for more that 10 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2016 sales to Starin Marketing represented approximately 16.3% of consolidated revenue with no other customer accounting for more that 10 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2015 sales to Starin Marketing and VSO represented approximately 14.2% and 10.4% of consolidated revenue with no other customer accounting for more that 10 percent.
 
As discussed above, distributors facilitate product sales to a large number of independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, and subsequently to their end-users. The loss of one or more distributors could reduce revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our shipped orders on which we had not recognized revenue were $4.6 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had a backlog of unshipped orders of approximately $0.2 million and $0.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Competition
 
The audio-visual product markets are characterized by intense competition, rapidly evolving technology, and increased business consolidation. We compete with businesses having substantially greater financial, research and product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources. If we are not able to continually design, manufacture, and successfully market new or enhanced products or services that are comparable or superior to those provided by our competitors and at comparable or better prices, we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales, gross profit margins, profits, and market share, each of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Our competitors vary within each product category. We believe we are able to differentiate ourselves and therefore successfully compete as a result of the high audio quality of our products resulting from a combination of proprietary and highly advanced audio signal processing technologies and networking technology in the form of trade secrets and patented intellectual property, technical and channel support services, and the strength of our channels and brands. It is critical for our success to be able to defend our intellectual property including trademarks, trade secrets and patents from our competitors who have far more resources.
 
We believe the principal factors driving sales are the following:
 

● | Quality, features and functionality, and ease of use of the products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broad and deep global channel partnerships; 
● | Significant established history of successful worldwide installations for diverse vertical markets;
● | Brand name recognition and acceptance; 
● | Quality of customer and partner sales and technical support services; and 
● | Effective sales and marketing. 

 
In the professional audio conferencing system and sound reinforcement markets our main competitors include AcousticMagic, AMX Harman, Audio Technica, Biamp, BOSE, Crestron, Extron, BSS Harman, Peavey, Phoenix Audio, Polycom, QSC, Shure, Symetrix, Vaddio and Yamaha and their original equipment manufacturing (OEM) partners, along with several other companies potentially poised to enter the market. We occupy the number one position in the global professional audio conferencing market with more than 50% of the global market share.
 
In the professional microphones market, our primary competitors include AKG, Audio Technica, Audix, Avlex/Mipro, Beyerdynamic, Biamp, Clock Audio, Lectrosonics, Nureva, Mediavision/Taiden, Polycom, Phoenix Audio, Sennheiser, Shure, TeachLogic, TOA, Yamaha/Revolabs and Vaddio and their OEM partners.
 
In the traditional tabletop conferencing market, we face significant competition from Avaya/Konftel, Phoenix Audio, Polycom and Yamaha, and especially from their OEM partnerships. A significant portion of the tabletop market is covered by sales through OEM partnerships. While we believe MAX products have unique features and superior quality, our limited OEM partnerships and pricing pressures from higher volume competitors limit our ability to expand our existing share of this market.
 
Our primary competitors in the personal conferencing market are GN Netcom (Jabra), Logitech, Phoenix Audio, Plantronics, Polycom, Sennheiser and Yamaha and their OEM partners.
 
Our video conferencing products face tremendous competition from well established players as well as emerging players, including Acano, Adobe Connect, Amazon Chime, Avaya (Radvision), Aver, Barco, Blackboard Collaborate, Blue Jeans, Christie Digital, Cisco, Citrix, Fuze, Huawei, IDK AV, InFocus, Kramer, LifeSize, Magor, Pexip, Polycom, Microsoft Skype for Business, Starleaf, Telylabs, UNIFY, Videxio, Vidyo, Yealink, Zoom, ZTE, Highfive, Google, Tixeo and Owl Labs. We believe the migration of video conferencing from hardware-based codecs to software-based codecs provides an opportunity for us to differentiate our products and gain market share.
 
Our network streaming products which includes digital signage products face intense competition from a few well-established corporations of diversified capabilities and strengths, including AMX, Atlona, Aurora Multimedia, Barco, Biamp, Broadsign, Cisco, Christie Digital, Crestron, Extron, Gefen, Goopie, Haivision, Hall Research, IDK AV, Infocus (Jupiter), Key Digital, Kramer, Liberty AV, Magenta Research, Matrox, Mediasite, Ncast, RGB Spectrum, Scala, Spinetix, SVSi, voLANte, Tightrope, Teracue, tvONE, UCView, VBrick, Visionary Solutions, Visix, WyreStorm and ZeeVee. We believe that our software based patented technology delivers superior audio and video streaming performance and flexibility and provides us with a competitive edge over other industry players.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Regulatory Environment
 
Regulations regarding product safety, product operational agency compliance, the materials used in manufacturing, the process of disposing of electronic equipment and the efficient use of energy may require extensive lead-time to obtain regulatory approvals of new products in both domestic and international markets. Such regulations may impact our ability to expand our sales in a timely and cost-effective manner and, as a result, our business could be harmed.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We manufacture our products through electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers, who are generally responsible for sourcing and procuring required raw materials and components. Most of the components that our EMS providers require for manufacturing our products are readily available from a number of sources. During 2017, we witnessed a significant tightening of the electronics market with demand for electronic products especially for memories and processors far exceeding the supply caused price increases and longer fulfillment cycles.
 
We continually work with our EMS providers to seek alternative sources for all our components and raw material requirements to ensure higher quality and better pricing. Most of our EMS providers and their vendors are duly qualified by our corporate quality assurance process. We work with our EMS providers to ensure that raw materials and components conform to our specifications.
 
Manufacturing
 
Currently, all of our products are manufactured by EMS providers. Our primary EMS provider is Flextronics. The digital signage products are assembled in our Salt Lake City, Utah facility.
Seasonality
 
We do not recognize a consistent pattern between the quarters to identify seasonality.
 
Research and Product Development
 
We are committed to research and product development and view our continued investment in research and product development as a key ingredient to our long-term business success. Our research and product development expenditures were approximately $9.3 million, $8.6 million and $8.3 million, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Our core competencies in research and product development include (a) many audio technologies, including acoustic echo cancellation, noise cancellation and other advanced adaptive digital signal processing technologies, (b) networking and multimedia streaming technologies, and (c) video technologies. We also have expertise in wireless technologies, VoIP, software and network application, and digital signage system development. We believe that continued investment in our core technological competencies is vital to developing new products and to enhancing existing products.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and processes to protect our proprietary rights.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 87 patents and 21 pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. Our patents and pending patent applications cover a wide range of our products and services including, but not limited to acoustic echo cancellation, beamforming microphone arrays, systems that enable streaming media over IP networks, algorithms for video processing, wireless conferencing systems, spatial audio, and technologies for the Internet of Things. The durations of our patents are determined by the laws of the country of issuance. For the U.S., patents may be 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of its filing, depending upon when the patent application was filed. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks, both in the U.S. and in other countries. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as the laws of the United States.
 
We will obtain patents and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Our intellectual property policy is to protect our products, technology and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent. From time to time, assertions of infringement of certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others have been made against us. In addition, certain pending claims against a competitor are in various stages of litigation. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for information regarding current legal proceedings involving our intellectual property rights.
 
We are dependent on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected. We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services. For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business.”
 
We generally require our employees, certain customers and partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any confidential aspect of our technology, services, or business. In addition, our employees are required to assign to us any proprietary information, inventions, or other technology created during the term of their employment with us. However, these precautions may not be sufficient to protect us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
 
On April 25, 2017, the Company was awarded a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,635,186 (the “186 Patent”), which relates to a system and method involving the combination of echo cancellation and beamforming microphone arrays. Also on April 25, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal District Court in the District of Utah against three parties—Shure, Inc. (“Shure”), Biamp Systems Corporation (“Biamp”), and QSC Audio Products, LLC (“QSC,” together with Shure and Biamp, collectively, the “Defendants”), alleging that the Defendants were jointly and indirectly infringing the newly issued ‘186 Patent (the “Infringement Action”). On that same day, Shure filed a separate action in the U.S. Federal District Court in the Northern District of Illinois (the “Illinois Action”) requesting a declaratory judgment as to the invalidity or non-infringement with respect to the ‘186 Patent. The Illinois Action also seeks the same declaratory judgment with respect to another Company patent, United States Patent No. 9,264,553 (the “553 Patent”), and which has not been asserted by the Company against any defendant and has been submitted to the USPTO for reissue. In early 2018, Shure added a claim that the ‘186 Patent is unenforceable.
