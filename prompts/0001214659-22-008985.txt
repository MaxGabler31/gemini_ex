Company Overview
 
We are an early clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel products for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (“Alzheimer’s”), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (“MDD”) and post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). With our two product candidates, we aim to bring treatments or cures to market as quickly as possible. Far too many individuals, patients and caregivers suffer from the burden created by these devastating, and often fatal, diseases. Our primary target, Alzheimer’s, was among the most-feared diseases (second only to cancer) among Americans, according to a 2011 survey by the Harvard School of Public Health. Alzheimer’s is also the sixth leading cause of death in the United States according to a 2021 report from the Alzheimer’s Association, a nonprofit that funds research. Existing Alzheimer’s treatments only temporarily relieve symptoms but do not slow or halt the progression of the disease, which currently affects roughly 6.2 million Americans and that number is expected to grow to 13 million individuals by 2050. Alzheimer’s also impacts more than 11 million Americans who provide an estimated 16 billion hours of unpaid care per year, valued at $272 billion, according to data provided by the Alzheimer’s Association. In 2022, the estimated healthcare costs for treating individuals with Alzheimer’s in the United States will be $321 billion, including $206 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments. These costs could rise to as high as $1 trillion per year by 2050 if no permanent treatment or cure for Alzheimer’s is found, the Alzheimer’s Association reported.
 
Our pipeline consists of two novel therapeutic drug candidates:
 

· | AL001 - A patented ionic cocrystal technology delivering a therapeutic combination of lithium, proline and salicylate, known as AL001, through two royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide licenses from the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc., as licensor (the “Licensor”); and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AL002 - A patented method using a mutant peptide sensitized cell as a cell-based therapeutic vaccine that seeks to restore the ability of a patient’s immunological system to combat Alzheimer’s, known as AL002 or CA022W, through a royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide license from the Licensor. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our most advanced product candidate (lead product) licensed and in clinical development in humans is an ionic cocrystal of lithium for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, MDD and PTSD. Based on our preclinical data, AL001 treatment prevents cognitive deficits, depression and irritability in APPSWE/PS1dE9 mice, and is superior in improving associative learning and memory and irritability compared with lithium carbonate treatments, supporting the potential of this lithium formulation for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, MDD and PTSD in humans. Lithium has been marketed for more than 35 years and human toxicology regarding lithium use has been well characterized, potentially mitigating the regulatory burden for safety data.
 
The results of randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of lithium in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s dementia and subjects with mild cognitive impairment have been widely published. Clinical studies have indicated that lithium administered at doses lower than those used for affective disorders can favorably impact Alzheimer’s outcomes. A study by O.V. Forlenza, et al., entitled “Disease-Modifying Properties of Long-Term Lithium Treatment for Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: Randomized Controlled Trial,” appearing in the British Journal of Psychiatry (2011) reported that lithium was superior to a placebo, evidencing a slower decline of cognitive function as measured by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale. Given the absence of adequate treatments that can slow, halt or even reverse the decline of this highly prevalent disease, the potential efficacy of lithium in the long-term management of Alzheimer’s may positively impact public health. There is an unmet medical need for safe and effective Alzheimer’s treatments, particularly for treatments with neuroprotective properties.
 
There is increasing evidence to suggest that depressive illness, particularly in the elderly, is associated with neuronal cell loss. These findings suggest that lithium may exert some of its long-term beneficial effects in the treatment of affective disorders via underappreciated neuroprotective effects. Molecular biology and animal studies have also suggested that lithium may offer protection against Alzheimer’s. Given the absence of other adequate treatments, the potential efficacy of lithium in the long-term treatment of neurodegenerative disorders may be warranted.

Following Phase III clinical trials in humans, we intend to seek approval to commercialize AL001 via a New Drug Application (“NDA”). As one of the initial steps of the NDA process, we submitted a pre-Investigational New Drug (“pre-IND”) briefing package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in July 2019 that argued against the need for any further preclinical safety studies. We submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA on June 30, 2021. On July 28, 2021, the FDA responded to our IND and stated that we may proceed with Phase I clinical trials in humans. We initiated our Phase I clinical trial on September 13, 2021. We completed our Phase I clinical trial in March 2022 and initiated a Phase IIA clinical trial in May 2022.
 
The ongoing Phase IIA study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of AL001 under multiple-dose, steady-state conditions and is determining the maximum tolerated dose in patients diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. The lithium and salicylate components of AL001 are to be given within the amounts already approved for use in patients for other indications. Up to 40 subjects will complete the Phase IIA trial. The maximum tolerated dose will then be used for further studies. Topline data are expected in December 2022 from this study.
 
Based on our preclinical data, AL001 has a positive effect on the pharmacodynamic biomarkers of Alzheimer’s. We propose to validate this clinically and if confirmed, we believe that AL001 is a candidate for breakthrough therapy designation because of its positive effect on a pharmacodynamic biomarker (beta-amyloids) and potential for a clinically meaningful effect on Alzheimer’s. A drug that receives a breakthrough therapy designation is eligible for fast-track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and FDA organizational commitment involving senior managers. However, we have not yet applied for breakthrough therapy designation nor have we received any official designation for expedited development. Our product candidate may not qualify for breakthrough therapy designation; further, even if it does qualify for breakthrough therapy designation, it may not actually lead to faster development or expedited regulatory review and approval or necessarily increase the likelihood that it will receive FDA approval.
 
Additionally, we believe that AL001 is positioned for an expedited Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug. AL001’s active pharmaceutical ingredients (lithium, proline and salicylate) are well documented and approved by the FDA. The provisions of 505(b)(2) were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (“reference” or “listed”) drug. This section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant. This process can result in a much less expensive and much faster route to approval, compared with a traditional development path such as 505(b)(1), while creating new, differentiated products with tremendous commercial value. If we successfully obtain a breakthrough therapy designation and the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug approvals, we believe we can shorten the development timeline for AL001. However, our product candidate may not qualify for expedited development or, if it does qualify for expedited development, it may not actually lead to faster development or expedited regulatory review and approval.
 
We believe that our ability to re-engineer lithium solid dosage forms in order to optimize performance has the potential to address a wide range of clinical applications ranging from neurodegenerative disorders, not merely Alzheimer’s, but also amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as ALS and Lou Gehrig’s disease), Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and traumatic brain injury, to more psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, MDD, mania, PTSD and suicidality. This novel approach is intended to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome of enhanced penetration through the blood-brain barrier and sustained brain lithium concentrations while systemic exposures (and toxicities) are mitigated for other organ systems. The optimal modified-release lithium dosing approach should avoid acutely toxic peak concentrations in blood, as well as in the brain, and should maintain such blood concentrations for a predictable, clinically relevant time, with overall low systemic exposures that mitigate the potential for adverse events. We anticipate that the lithium delivery system will be adaptable to a dosing regimen that maintains therapeutic brain lithium concentrations consistently for the longest possible time while allowing only modest exposures and providing adequate recovery periods between doses for other organ systems.
 
We have an additional preclinical candidate for Alzheimer’s, AL002, which has transitioned from early-stage development to an extensive program of preclinical study and evaluation that was completed on May 31, 2021, and was followed by a comprehensive report prepared by Charles River Laboratories, Inc., an independent preclinical service provider, received on July 23, 2021. We submitted a pre-IND meeting request for AL002 and supporting briefing documents to the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research of the FDA on July 30, 2021. We received a written response to relating to the pre-IND from the FDA providing a path for Alzamend’s planned clinical development of AL002 on September 30, 2021. The FDA agreed to allow Alzamend to submit an IND to conduct a combined Phase I/II study. We anticipate submitting an IND to initiate a Phase I/II study for AL002 in September 2022.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We intend to develop and commercialize therapeutics that are better than existing treatments and have the potential to significantly improve the lives of individuals afflicted by Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, MDD and PTSD. To achieve these goals, we are pursuing the following key business strategies:

• | Advance clinical development of AL001 and AL002 for Alzheimer’s treatment. For our lead candidate, AL001, we completed our Phase I clinical trial in March 2022 and initiated a Phase IIA clinical trial in May 2022. We anticipate topline data in December 2022 from our ongoing Phase IIA multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial for AL001 treatment of dementia related to Alzheimer’s. We completed our preclinical study and evaluation of AL002 on May 31, 2021, and anticipate submitting an IND to initiate a Phase I/II study in September 2022;

• | Expand our pipeline of pharmaceuticals to include additional indications for AL001 and delivery methods. Another element of our business strategy is to expand our pipeline of pharmaceuticals based on our technology and advance these product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of indications. In addition to treating Alzheimer’s, AL001 has the potential to treat a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. We plan to pursue the treatment of bipolar disorder, MDD, and PTSD with AL001, and in May 2022, we submitted a pre-IND meeting request to the FDA for these indications and received a written response from the FDA in July 2022. Based on the written response from the FDA, we plan to submit separate INDs for bipolar disorder, MDD, and PTSD after completion of the current Phase II MAD clinical trial, which would allow us to initiate Phase II studies in each of those indications. We also plan to explore different formulations (liquid, immediate release and sprinkle capsules) to deliver AL001;

• | Focus on translational and functional endpoints to efficiently develop product candidates. We believe AL001 is positioned for a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug approvals. We also believe AL001 and AL002 are positioned for breakthrough therapy designations because of their positive effects on a pharmacodynamic biomarker (beta-amyloids) and potential for a clinically meaningful effect on Alzheimer’s, making them eligible to receive assistance from the FDA throughout the development process that may shorten the development timelines. However, we have neither received breakthrough therapy designation nor have we qualified for expedited development, and no assurance can be given that we will. Even if we qualify for breakthrough therapy designation or expedited development, it may not actually lead to faster development or expedited regulatory review and approval or necessarily increase the likelihood that we will receive FDA approval; and

• | Optimize the value of AL001 and AL002 in major markets. We intend to commercialize AL001 and AL002 by seeking FDA marketing approval for both product candidates and partnering with biopharmaceutical companies seeking to strategically fortify pipelines and, in turn, receiving funding for the costly later-stage clinical development. We do not anticipate selling products directly into the marketplace, though we may do so depending on market conditions. Our focus is expected to concentrate on entering into strategical transactions with established distributors and producers, which will provide distribution and marketing capabilities for the sale of our products into the marketplace.

Our Development Pipeline
 
The following chart provides an overview of the current development stages of our therapeutic product candidates.
 


Our Proprietary Technology AL001 Drug Candidate
 
Our lead product candidate that we have licensed and have begun clinical development in humans is an ionic cocrystal of lithium for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, MDD and PTSD. Lithium salts have a long history of human consumption beginning in the 1800s. In psychiatry, they have been used to treat mania and as a prophylactic for depression since the mid-20th century. Today, lithium salts are used as a mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Although the FDA has approved no medications as safe and effective treatments for suicidality, lithium has proven to be the only drug that consistently reduces suicidality in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite these effective medicinal uses, current FDA-approved lithium pharmaceutics (lithium carbonate and lithium citrate) are limited by a narrow therapeutic window that requires regular blood monitoring of plasma lithium levels and blood chemistry by a clinician to mitigate adverse events. Because conventional lithium salts (carbonate and citrate) are eliminated relatively quickly, multiple administrations throughout the day are required to safely reach therapeutic plasma concentrations. Existing lithium drugs, such as lithium chloride and lithium carbonate, suffer from chronic toxicity, poor physicochemical properties and poor brain bioavailability. Because lithium is so effective at reducing manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder, it is still used clinically despite its narrow therapeutic index. This has led researchers to begin to look for alternatives to lithium with similar bioactivities.

Scientists from the University of South Florida have developed a new lithium cocrystal composition and method of preparation that, under certain clinical and/or testing conditions, have been shown to allow for lower dosages to achieve therapeutic brain levels of lithium for psychiatric disorders, which could lead to a broadening of lithium’s therapeutic index. Our studies and/or testing have indicated that the compound offers improved physiochemical properties compared to existing forms of lithium, giving it the potential to be developed as an anti-suicidal drug and for use against mood disorders.
 
Recent evidence suggests that lithium may be efficacious for both the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s. Unlike traditional medications which only address a single therapeutic target, lithium appears to be neuroprotective through several modes of action. For example, recent studies have indicated that it exerts neuroprotective effects, in part, by increasing a brain-derived neurotrophic factor leading to restoration of learning and memory. Another neuroprotective mechanism of lithium indicated by recent studies is the attenuation of the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and nitric oxide in activated microglia. Results from recent clinical studies suggest that lithium treatment may reduce dementia development while preserving cognitive function and reducing biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s.
 
The novel ionic cocrystal of lithium (AL001), which was designed, synthesized and characterized by a team of inventors from the University of South Florida has been shown to exhibit improved nonclinical pharmacokinetics compared to currently FDA-approved lithium products and is also bioactive in many in vitro models of Alzheimer’s. AL001 may constitute a means of treating Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, MDD and PTSD. Our preclinical studies encompassed the treatment of 28 transgenic (or genetically modified) and 10 non-transgenic mice with lithium carbonate and AL001. In particular, female APPSWE/PS1dE9 mice at 4 months of age were fed with either regular chow (Tg-Ctrl, n=8) or chow that contained lithium carbonate (LC, 0.05% equivalent to 83 mg/kg/day, n=6), or lithium salicylate (LS, 0.20% equivalent to 325 mg/kg/day, n=6), or lithium salicylate proline co-crystal, AL001 (AL001, 0.35% equivalent to 583 mg/kg/day, n=8) for 9 months. In addition, aged-matched non- transgenic background control mice (B6C3F1/J, Non-Tg-Ctrl, n=10) were fed regular chow for 9 months as control. Each treatment group was subject to a battery of behavioral tests at 12 months of age and mice were sacrificed at 13 months of age. The results of our preclinical studies, conducted from May 2016 to June 2017, are summarized below:
 

• | AL001 treatment improved cognitive function by 50% (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p<0.01), in comparison with the control group, through behavioral tests administered to mice with Alzheimer’s. The tests resulted in 50% lower escape latency (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p<0.01) during the training and probe trial of the Morris water maze test and 50% longer contextual freezing time (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p<0.05) during the fear conditioning test;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AL001 treatment reduced depression by 25% (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p<0.001), as assessed by the tail suspension test, and irritability by 50% (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p<0.01), as assessed by the touch escape test;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In comparison with lithium carbonate treatment, AL001 treatment afforded superior protection against cognitive impairment by 50% (LC vs. AL001; p<0.05), as shown by the contextual fear conditioning test, and irritability by 50% (LC vs. AL001: p<0.01);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued AL001 treatment prevented cognitive deficits, depression and irritability and, compared to lithium carbonate treatments, was superior in improving associative learning and memory (LC vs. AL001: p<0.05) and in reducing irritability (LC vs. AL001: p<0.01), supporting the potential of this lithium formulation for the treatment of Alzheimer’s;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AL001 had no effect on renal COX2 activity (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p>0.05), a biomarker of renal toxicity, while markedly reducing abnormal biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s by 50%, in particular beta-amyloid pathology, tau phosphorylation and neuro-inflammation (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p<0.01);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AL001 treatment did not induce tissue pathological damage in the heart, kidneys, liver and lungs by a general autopsy (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p>0.05). In contrast, equimolar doses (using a similar structure of moles but different active pharmaceutical ingredient) of lithium carbonate enhanced renal COX2 expression while having little or no impact on Alzheimer’s pathology (Tg-Ctrl vs. LC: p<0.01);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AL001, at the effective dose, yielded 50% higher lithium levels (LC vs. AL001; p<0.01) in the brain compared with equimolar doses of lithium carbonate (AL001 vs. LC; p<0.05), while producing low nontoxic steady state levels in the body; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No significant differences in body weight, brain, heart, lungs, spleen, liver or kidneys were found between cohorts treated with AL001 and untreated cohorts. (Tg-Ctrl vs. AL001: p>0.05).

In analyzing the preclinical study results, a p-value is used to determine the probability as to whether the difference between two data sets is due to chance. The smaller the p-value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, the outcome is considered statistically significant. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05. A p-value greater than 0.05 is considered statistically non-significant. As shown above, all of the results of our preclinical studies were statistically significant compared to the control group.
 
On September 13, 2021, we initiated a randomized, balanced, Phase I, single-dose, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, two- sequence, crossover, relative bioavailability study to investigate lithium pharmacokinetics and safety of AL001 formulation compared to a marketed immediate release lithium carbonate formulation in healthy subjects. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relative bioavailability of the AL001 lithium formulation relative to a marketed lithium carbonate formulation in healthy subjects for the purpose of determining potential clinically safe and effective AL001 dosing in future studies. Additionally, we wanted to characterize safety and tolerability of the tested formulations under the conditions of this study. This was a first-in-human study of the AL001 formulation; this trial was designed to assess the relative bioavailability of the AL001 lithium formulation compared to a marketed lithium carbonate formulation in at least 24 completed healthy subjects (30 subjects were to be enrolled) for the purpose of determining potential clinically safe and effective AL001 dosing in future studies. The AL001 lithium content was nearly half of the reference lithium carbonate capsule dosage as it was expected that treatment of frail Alzheimer’s patients will require half the lithium dose used for treatment of bipolar/affective disorders. Lithium carbonate 300 mg (Reference product) was given as a single dose in this study; this is often used as a starting dose for treatment of bipolar/affective disorders when given three times daily. The shape of the AL001 lithium plasma concentration versus time curve was unknown prior to this study. Also unknown were the AL001 rate and extent of lithium absorption. The Phase I study was completed in March 2022 with the following results:
 

· | AL001 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy adult subjects;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No serious adverse events and no deaths were reported during the trial;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The safety profiles of both AL001 and the marketed lithium carbonate capsule were benign;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No clinically significant abnormal findings in electrocardiograms were noted during the trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AL001 salicylate plasma concentrations were observed to be well tolerated and consistently within safe limits; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Dose-adjusted relative bioavailability analyses of the rate and extent of lithium absorption in plasma indicated that AL001 1050 mg (lithium content equivalent to 150 mg lithium carbonate) is bioequivalent to a marketed 300 mg lithium carbonate capsule and the shapes of the lithium plasma concentration versus time curves are similar. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On May 5, 2022, we initiated a multiple-dose, steady-state, double-blind, ascending dose safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic study (www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT05363293) of AL001 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s with the following objectives:
 

· | Primary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL001 under multiple-dose, steady-state conditions in Alzheimer’s patients;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Secondary: To characterize the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AL001 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exploratory: Determination of qualitative and quantitative evaluations of AD patient desirable characteristics for future Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies in order to:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Facilitate recruitment into subsequent AL001 clinical trials; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Facilitate trial-adherence to completion of study requirements including treatment adherence.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious condition (for which the FDA considers Alzheimer’s) and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). For purposes of breakthrough therapy designation, a clinically significant endpoint generally refers to an endpoint that measures an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), or on symptoms that represent serious consequences of the disease. A clinically significant endpoint can also refer to findings that suggest an effect on IMM or serious symptoms, including:
 

• | an effect on an established surrogate endpoint;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint considered reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit (i.e., the accelerated approval standard);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- 6 -
-----


• | an effect on a pharmacodynamic biomarker (which is a measurable indicator of the disease state) that does not meet criteria for an acceptable surrogate endpoint, but strongly suggests the potential for a clinically meaningful effect on the underlying disease; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a significantly improved safety profile compared to available therapy (e.g., less dose-limiting toxicity for an oncology agent), with evidence of similar efficacy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on our preclinical data, AL001 has a positive effect on the pharmacodynamic biomarkers of Alzheimer’s. As a result, we believe that if the data from AL001 in the aforementioned Phase II study provides confirmation of the pre-clinical data, i.e., positive effect on a pharmacodynamic biomarker (beta-amyloids) and potential for a clinically meaningful effect on Alzheimer’s, AL001 will be a candidate for breakthrough therapy designation. If breakthrough therapy designation is granted, it would be eligible for intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and FDA organizational commitment involving senior managers. However, we have neither received breakthrough therapy designation nor have we qualified for expedited development. Our product candidate may not qualify for breakthrough therapy designation; further, even if it does qualify for breakthrough therapy designation, it may not actually lead to faster development or expedited regulatory review and approval or necessarily increase the likelihood that it will receive FDA approval.
 
Additionally, we believe that AL001 is positioned for an expedited Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug. AL001’s active pharmaceutical ingredients (lithium, proline and salicylate) are well documented and approved by the FDA. The provisions of Section 505(b)(2) were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (“reference” or “listed”) drug. This section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant. This can result in a much less expensive and much faster route to approval, compared with a traditional development path such as Section 505(b)(1), while creating new, differentiated products with tremendous commercial value. If we successfully obtain a breakthrough therapy designation and the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug approvals, we believe we can shorten the development timeline for AL001. However, our product candidate may not qualify for expedited development or, if it does qualify for expedited development, it may not actually lead to faster development or expedited regulatory review and approval.


AL001 will require extensive clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before it or any successors are likely to provide us with any revenue. As a result, if we do not successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval for and commercialize AL001, our long-term business plans will not be met, and we will be unable to generate the revenue we have forecast for the foreseeable future, if any. We do not anticipate that we will generate our maximum revenue for several years, or that we will achieve profitability for this therapeutic drug candidate until at least a few years after generating material revenue, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue or raise substantial additional capital, we will not be able to pursue any expansion of our business or acquire additional intellectual property, we will not become profitable with this therapeutic drug candidate, and we will be unable to continue our operations at the currently planned pace, if at all.
 
AL002 Drug Candidate
 
The other product candidate that we have licensed to clinically develop in humans is AL002, a patented method using a mutant peptide sensitized cell as a cell-based therapeutic vaccine which seeks to restore the ability of the patient’s immunological system to combat Alzheimer’s. The proposed mechanism of action is through the pulsed-Dendritic Cell (“DC”) activation of T-cells that stimulates the immune system, resulting in the clearance of brain amyloid. Preclinical studies conducted from April 2005 to July 2010 suggest that the infusion of transgenic (or genetically modified) mice with AL002-pulsed DCs is associated with lower amyloid burden and improved neuro-behavioral performance. This is likely to be mediated by an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to the immunogenicity of this therapy.
 
AL002 is based on the theory that Alzheimer’s symptoms may be caused in large part by plaque deposits that can cluster in the brain composed of protein fragments called beta-amyloids that build up between nerve cells. One hypothesis is that a special type of immune cell, natural beta-amyloid antibodies, may play a role in preventing plaque build-up in people without Alzheimer’s. As people age, their immune systems may degrade, and some people may be unable to produce natural beta-amyloid antibodies, the absence of which leads to the plaque build-up causing Alzheimer’s.
 
AL002 is intended to elicit an immune response to produce anti-amyloid antibodies, which can then neutralize circulated beta-amyloids and prevent additional plaque build-up. The mutant antigen within AL002 was selected specifically for its high HLA binding affinity, thereby avoiding the need for an adjuvant, which may cause an adverse (Th1) immune response.
 
AL002 is an autologous modified DC treatment. More precisely, it is a patient-specific therapy where the patient undergoes leukapheresis, a nonsurgical treatment used to reduce the quantity of white blood cells in the bloodstream, to isolate peripheral blood monocytes that are subsequently matured into DCs using an IL4+ GM-CSF cocktail. The DCs are incubated with a modified amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide (“AL002 peptide”) to sensitize them, and then administered to the same patient.

Significant evidence has accumulated recently suggesting that immunotherapy is a highly promising modality of treatment in Alzheimer’s. Most current immune-based active investigations are focused on passive immunization by pre-prepared Aβ antibody administration. Active immunization may offer additional or more lasting effects on the clearance of amyloid and a safer approach due to its reliance on autologous immune mechanisms. Further, preliminary evidence suggests a recurrence of the amyloid accumulation after clearance with the immunoglobulins. A prior attempt at engaging the immune system to treat Alzheimer’s was conducted using the immunization with pre-aggregated synthetic Aβ (AN-1792) combined with the immunogenic adjuvant QS-21. The Phase IIA study with AN-1792 was terminated by the FDA due to severe meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of vaccinated subjects. We believe that this may have been caused by using a strong non-specific antigenic determinant T-cell epitope in the Aβ 1-42 peptide and the inclusion of a QS21 adjuvant and polysorbate-80 stabilizing agent in the vaccine formulation.
 
On July 23, 2021, we announced that Alzamend received positive toxicology results for AL002 in a good laboratory practices (“GLP”) toxicology study using a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s. The study was conducted by Charles River Laboratories. AL002 is a patented method using a mutant-peptide sensitized cell as a cell-based therapeutic vaccine that seeks to restore the ability of a patient’s immunological system to combat Alzheimer’s.
 
A five-dose GLP study with AL002-sensitized cells was completed using a transgenic (or genetically modified) mouse model of Alzheimer’s to investigate the tolerability of AL002. Single injections were administered on days 1, 30, 50, 70, and 90. The mice were evaluated for potential toxicity and reversibility of any findings at 75 and 90 days after dosing.
 
Histopathology results demonstrate that there was no indication of T-cell infiltration or meningoencephalitis suggesting that AL002 therapy is safe and tolerable as there were no adverse findings over a 90-day period and 90 days after the last dose. There were no treatment-related mortalities or reports of adverse effects on clinical observations, body weight parameters, organ weight parameters, clinical pathology parameters, gross pathology observations, or histopathologic observations during the main study or the recovery phase.
 
Modified cell therapies, especially DCs, may provide a safer and more patient-specific active immunization. Ex-vivo modification of DCs as a modality of treatment has been previously used in oncological therapeutics. It has been shown to be relatively safe and capable of engaging the immune system to attack the target tissues with success. Its use in Alzheimer’s therapeutics is relatively recent. We are proposing to conduct a first-in-human Phase I/II study of autologous DC, pulsed with a modified Aβ epitope. Preclinical work supports that it is associated with positive anti-inflammatory response and a decrease in brain amyloid contents. We anticipate submitting an IND to initiate a Phase I/II study for AL002 in September 2022.
 
A product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A drug that receives a breakthrough therapy designation is eligible for fast-track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and FDA organizational commitment involving senior managers. We believe that AL002 is positioned for a breakthrough therapy designation because of its positive effect on a pharmacodynamic biomarker (beta-amyloids) and potential for a clinically meaningful effect on Alzheimer’s. If we successfully acquire a breakthrough therapy designation for new drug approvals, we believe we can shorten the development timeline for AL002. However, we have neither received breakthrough therapy designation nor qualified for expedited development. Our product candidate may not qualify for breakthrough therapy designation; further, even if it does qualify for breakthrough therapy designation, it may not actually lead to faster development or expedited regulatory review and approval or necessarily increase the likelihood that it will receive FDA approval.
 
AL002 will require extensive clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before it or any successors are likely to provide us with any revenue. As a result, if we do not successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval for and commercialize AL002, our long-term business plans will not be met, and we will be unable to generate the revenue we have forecast for the foreseeable future, if any. We do not anticipate that we will generate our maximum revenue for several years, or that we will achieve profitability for this therapeutic drug candidate until at least a few years after generating material revenue, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue or raise substantial additional capital, we will not be able to pursue any expansion of our business or acquire additional intellectual property, we will not become profitable with this therapeutic drug candidate, and we will be unable to continue our operations at the currently planned pace, if at all.


Intellectual Property and Licensing Agreements
 
On June 2, 2018, we entered into two Standard Exclusive License Agreements with Sublicensing Terms for AL001 with the Licensor and its affiliate, the University of South Florida (the “AL001 License Agreements”), pursuant to which the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide licenses limited to the field of Alzheimer’s, under United States Patent Nos. (i) 9,840,521, entitled “Organic Anion Lithium Ionic Cocrystal Compounds and Compositions”, filed September 24, 2015 and granted December 12, 2017, and (ii) 9,603,869, entitled “Lithium Co-Crystals for Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders”, filed May 21, 2016 and granted March 28, 2017.

Market Opportunity
 
The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that the cost of caring for people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias will reach $321 billion in 2022, including $206 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments, and that by 2050, these costs may rise as high as $1 trillion per year. Alzamend was formed to develop and commercialize patented intellectual property and treatments for Alzheimer’s, by funding it from preclinical through clinical trials and ultimately, if successful, make it available to the global market. Additionally, we are supporting ongoing research at the USF Health College of Medicine and plan to support others with first rights of refusal on technologies for treating terminal diseases.
 
In an article jointly issued on April 8, 2016, Allergan and Heptares cited currently significant unmet medical needs and a heavy economic burden caused by cognitive impairment and dementia across multiple diseases, noting that currently available drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s provide limited and transient effects on cognition. They cite projections of healthcare costs, including nursing home care, associated with Alzheimer’s and dementia (currently estimated to be in excess of $640 billion for North America, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific), that are continuing to grow based on data from the World Health Organization, Alzheimer’s International, the National Institute of Mental Health and the Lewy Body Dementia Association.
 
This medical shortfall puts a spotlight on an urgent need for development of new therapies capable of treating the estimated more than 45 million people worldwide suffering from Alzheimer’s today, 6.2 million in North America, 7.5 million in Western Europe and 3.6 million in Asia-Pacific, a number expected to increase to more than 130 million by 2050. Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, estimated to be associated with some 60% to 70% of cases. An additional estimated 1.4 million patients in the United States suffer from Lewy body dementia. We believe that the potential marketplace for a commercialized therapy or treatment would be tremendously significant with large financial support available from numerous national and international pharmaceutical companies and various governments and worldwide agencies.
 
Industry Overview
 
Currently, Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and, when extrapolated globally, the market for preventions, treatments and cures of this crippling disease is massive. Since 1990, life expectancy has increased by six years and the worldwide average continues to increase. With the increase in the mean age of the population in developed countries, the prevalence of deteriorating neurological diseases has also increased. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, in the United States alone, one of nine persons over the age of 65 have Alzheimer’s, with roughly 6.2 million Americans currently living with it. It is estimated that this number will grow to 13 million by 2050 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure the disease. Many Alzheimer’s related associations believe the actual number of adults with Alzheimer’s may be much higher since current statistics do not take in account deaths from complications or from related diseases like pneumonia or heart attack. These death certificates only list the most immediate cause. The fastest growing age group in the United States is the “over 85” group within which one in three individuals have Alzheimer’s.
 
Although deaths from other major causes have decreased significantly, official records indicate that deaths from Alzheimer’s have increased significantly. Between 2000 and 2019, the number of deaths from Alzheimer’s as recorded on death certificates has more than doubled, increasing 145.2%, while the number of deaths from the number one cause of death (heart disease) decreased 7.3%.
 
Every 65 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s. Of the 10 most fatal diseases in the United States, Alzheimer’s is the only one with no cure, no known way of deceleration and no known means of prevention. Alzamend was formed to commercialize patented intellectual property in this space, by funding it from its present state through human clinical trials administered by the FDA and ultimately, if successful, potentially making it available to the global market.
 
Alzheimer’s
 
Alzheimer’s average annual incidence for individuals aged 65 to 74 was 0.4%. In individuals ages 75 to 84, the annual incidence was 3.2%, and for ages 85 and older (the “oldest-old”), the incidence was 7.6%. It is estimated that the cost of caring for people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias will increase from an estimated $305 billion in 2020 to a projected $1.1 trillion per year by 2050 with Medicare and Medicaid covering approximately 70% of such costs. Over 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that, in 2021, caregivers to individuals with Alzheimer’s will provide 15.3 billion hours of care valued at $257 billion.
 
The cause and progression of Alzheimer’s are not well understood. Through May 2022, more than 3,793 clinical trials have been or are being conducted to find ways to treat the disease, but it is unknown if any of the tested treatments will work.
 

- 11 -
------


According to the Alzheimer’s Association, it is widely accepted that, with the increasing trend towards a longer lifespan coupled with the baby-boomer population approaching retirement, the incidence of Alzheimer’s is likely to double in the next 30 years. The exponential increase in the expected number of patients presenting with Alzheimer’s not only represents a major area of unmet medical need, but it also constitutes a significant market opportunity for diagnostics for this disease. Alzheimer’s biomarker sales in 2011 were reported at $1.5 billion but are expected have doubled in 2018 to over $3 billion. (BCC research 2013, “Advances in biomarker and monitoring diagnostics: Great markets, not so great health effects” by Bjørn Hofmann PhD and H. Gilbert Welch MD, MPH, 2017).
 
Current clinical research focuses on the early phases of the disease. However, to our knowledge, no accurate and convenient tools are available today for pre-dementia diagnosis of Alzheimer’s to support these efforts. Currently, Alzheimer’s is diagnosed using a process that combines cognition assessments with imaging and spinal-fluid tests. This diagnostic procedure may last for several months to a year and is usually initiated late in the disease development.
 
Several companies are focusing on blood as a test material. Typically, these companies employ a multi-assay strategy (multiple RNAs or proteins) combined with advanced statistical tools/algorithms to develop disease-specific diagnostic models.
 
Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Landscape
 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, the following is a pictorial representation of the more recent published data encompassing the Alzheimer’s therapeutics landscape.
 



- 12 -
------


There are currently several experimental therapeutic agents for Alzheimer’s in various stages of development with clinical testing directed towards amyloid-beta, or Aβ, clearance, and inhibition of Tau protein aggregation or phosphorylated-Tau, or pTau, clearance. In June 2021, the FDA approved Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab, also known as Aduhelm, making it the first medication cleared by U.S. regulators to reduce amyloid plaques in people living with Alzheimer’s and the first new medication for the disease in nearly two decades. There were previously no drugs cleared by the FDA that can slow the mental decline from Alzheimer’s, which is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. The FDA approved Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm, aimed at helping symptoms, not actually slowing the disease itself. Recent clinical failures involving Aβ clearance highlight the incomplete understanding of the pathological processes in Alzheimer’s and clearly demonstrate the need for novel strategies to fight the disease.


Clinical Management
 
We have retained Rio Pharmaceutical Services and TAMM Net, Inc., to lead, develop and manage our preclinical and clinical efforts, extending from the current status of each product candidate through the exit or commercialization of the technologies that we have licensed. We may retain experienced Canadian and European Union consulting firms to commercialize these same technologies for those geographic markets.
Manufacturing
 
Currently, we do not have in-house manufacturing capabilities. We have outsourced and expect to continue to outsource the manufacturing of our products to third party contractors, with special capabilities to manufacture chemical drugs and biologic drug candidates for submission and clinical testing under FDA guidelines and, for AL001, have received Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, material manufactured for clinical trial. There are several sources of manufacturing available once a therapy or treatment can achieve Phase II study as identified in a publication by Pharma.org released in 2013 (http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/Alzheimer’s%202013.pdf).
Distribution and Marketing
 
We intend to develop AL001 and AL002 through successive de-risking milestones towards regulatory approval and seek marketing approval of AL001 and AL002 or enter into partnering transactions with biopharmaceutical companies seeking to strategically fortify pipelines and, in turn, receiving funding for the costly later-stage clinical development required to achieve successful commercialization. We do not anticipate selling products directly into the marketplace, though we may do so depending on market conditions. Our focus is to strategically effect partnering transactions which will provide distribution and marketing capabilities to sell products into the marketplace.
Government Regulation
 
Clinical trials, the pharmaceutical approval process, and the marketing of pharmaceutical products, are intensively regulated in the United States and in all major foreign countries.
 
Human Health Product Regulation in the United States
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related regulations promulgated thereunder. Pharmaceuticals are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, a clinical hold on trials, a refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products.
 
The FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of new disease indications or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or elsewhere.

Marketing Approval
 
The process required by the FDA before human health care pharmaceuticals may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 

• | nonclinical laboratory and, at times, animal tests;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of an NDA or BLA, which must occur before a drug or biologic product can be marketed or sold.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will need to successfully complete sufficient clinical trials in order to be in a position to submit a BLA or NDA to the FDA. We will reach agreement with the FDA on the proposed protocols for our future clinical trials in the U.S. A separate submission to the FDA must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site, and an informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may each suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on numerous grounds.
 
For purposes of BLA or NDA approval for human health products, human clinical trials are typically conducted in phases that may overlap.
 

• | Phase I. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. This phase involves trials in a limited subject population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase II studies may be sub-categorized into Phase IIA studies which are smaller, pilot studies to evaluate limited drug exposure and efficacy signals, and Phase IIB studies, which are larger studies testing both safety and efficacy more rigorously.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. This phase involves trials undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded subject population, often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
 
New Drug and Biologics License Applications
 
In order to obtain approval to market a pharmaceutical in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies (such as with the Orphan Drug Designation discussed below). For fiscal year 2021, the FDA set the application fee at $2,875,842 for new drug applications that require clinical data. The manufacturer and/or sponsor of certain drugs approved under an NDA or BLA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees, currently set at $336,432 per product for fiscal year 2021. These fees are typically increased annually. The NDA or BLA includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.

- 14 -
------


The FDA will initially review the NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with current GMP, or cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it typically considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.


Based on pivotal Phase III trial results submitted in an NDA or BLA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant a “Priority Review” designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six to eight months, rather than the standard ten to 12 months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority Review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products or offers a therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Priority Review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA or BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the application for the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA or BLA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured, even if such facilities are located overseas. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 
Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites and manufacturing sites to assure compliance with GCP and GMP. If the FDA determines that any of the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities is not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine that the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA or BLA. Additionally, the FDA may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing process and require changes prior to approval. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
The testing and approval process for a drug requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and this process may take up to several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
 
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase IV studies may be made a condition that must be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-market studies to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. Any approvals that we may ultimately receive could be withdrawn if required post-marketing trials or analyses do not meet the FDA requirements, which would materially harm the commercial prospects for AL001 or AL002.
 
The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA or BLA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA or BLA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA or BLA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act review cycle, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, a REMS is subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 
Even if AL001 or AL002 receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for AL001 or AL002, or obtaining approval only for significantly limited use, would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
Companies may also consider seeking FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) NDA process if their product candidates are similar to previously approved drugs but differ in dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 and is also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The purpose of Section 505(b)(2) is to allow companies to avoid duplicative testing by allowing applicants to utilize data from previous clinical and non-clinical studies in the current NDA submission, when pertinent. The 505(b)(2) application process requires, among other things, the submission of data from studies demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy for the new indication.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit companies to rely upon not only certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product, but also the FDA’s conclusions from a prior review of the studies. Additionally, the FDA may require companies to perform further studies to support changes from the approved product. After completion of the review, the FDA may approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the NDA. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not created by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, the applicant must still submit data related to the manufacturing and quality of the product candidate, such as information about the development, process, stability, qualification and validation.
 
If a company chooses to rely on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the company is required to provide a certification statement for any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book publication. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) until any non-patent exclusivity period for the reference product has expired, such as the exclusivity granted for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act
 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, requires pharmaceutical companies to divulge certain information regarding their products which has the effect of making it easier for other companies to manufacture generic drugs to compete with those products.
Patent Term Extension. After receipt of an NDA or BLA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for a patent extension of up to five years. The permissible patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase, that is, the time between IND submission and NDA or BLA submission, and all of the review phase, or the time between either NDA or BLA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.
 
Environmental Regulations. The U.S. generally requires an environmental assessment, which discusses a company’s proposed action, possible alternatives to the action, and whether the further analysis of an environmental impact statement is necessary. Certain exemptions are available from the requirement to perform an environmental assessment and an environmental impact statement. Once an exemption is claimed, a company must state to the FDA that no extraordinary circumstances exist that may significantly affect the environment. We may claim an exemption, under the category for biologic products, from the requirement to provide an environmental assessment and an environmental impact statement for AL001 or AL002 and further state to the FDA that, to our knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist that would significantly affect the environment.

FDA Post-Approval Requirements
 
Following the approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA continues to require adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a manufacturer fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, which includes measures that have significantly changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, became law in the U.S. The ACA is a sweeping measure intended to expand health care coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. The ACA has significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA requires discounts under the Medicare drug benefit program and increased rebates on drugs covered by Medicaid. In addition, the ACA imposes an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. There have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify, amend or eliminate the ACA. For example, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. The case has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and is awaiting a ruling. At this time, the financial impact of these discounts, increased rebates and fees and the other provisions of the ACA on our business are unclear. However, the fees, discounts and other provisions of this law are expected to have a significant negative effect on the profitability of pharmaceuticals.
Human Health Product Regulation in the European Union
 
In addition to domestic regulations, we may eventually be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the EU Member States resulting from the national implementation of underlying EU legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we will be required to submit a marketing authorization application. This application is similar to the BLA in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using (i) the centralized authorization procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, (iii) the decentralized procedure or (iv) the national authorization procedure.
 
The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EU, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, at times referred to as the European Economic Area. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that: (i) are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases; (iii) are officially designated orphan drugs; and (iv) constitute advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs that do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which, on the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, was not authorized in the European Economic Area; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients at European Economic Area level.

Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a Marketing Authorization Application by the EMA is 210 days, though the date count stops whenever the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) asks the applicant for additional written or oral information, with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, as when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: (i) the seriousness of the disease to be treated; (ii) the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and (iii) anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.


The Mutual Recognition Procedure (“MRP”) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Essentially, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more EU Member States.
 
The principal characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already existing marketing authorization in an EU Member State that is used as reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other Member States. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more EU Member States and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other EU Member States by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The EU Member State in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference EU Member State. The EU Member States where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned EU Member States.
 
The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by EU Member States of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference EU Member State, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other EU Member States. In such case, the reference EU Member State will update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all EU Member States, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned EU Member States then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the referenced EU Member State and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations will be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.
 
If any EU Member State refuses to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference EU Member State on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within 60 days, EU Member States will, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products.
 
Human Health Product Regulation in the Rest of World
 
For countries outside of the EU, such as Canada, countries in Eastern Europe or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Regulatory Considerations
 
Labeling, Marketing and Promotion. Once an NDA or BLA is approved, or just before approval, a product will be subject to certain marketing and promotional requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities on the internet and elsewhere.
 
While doctors are free to prescribe any pharmaceutical approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to the safety and efficacy of a pharmaceutical that are consistent with the FDA approval, and is only allowed to actively market a pharmaceutical for the particular indication approved by the FDA. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA/BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals.
 
Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws. In the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, state false claims acts and anti-kickback statutes, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular pharmaceutical, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including pharmaceuticals, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
 
Many states have similar anti-kickback or false claims statutes that can be even broader than their federal counterparts. There is also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, a federal law known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and to disclose any physician ownership in the previous calendar year. The data is published annually in a publicly searchable database. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
 
Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements. In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., its Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/ educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended, among others. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements will apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Legislative changes also require that discounted prices be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors that ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities or register their sales representatives. Other legislation has been enacted in certain states prohibiting pharmacies and other health care entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition and other laws and regulations.

Our Intellectual Property
 
We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as a trade secret or is protected by confidentiality agreements. Accordingly, patents or other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. Currently, we do not own a patent, although we do possess a license for an immunotherapy technology and two licenses for a lithium, salicylate and proline cocrystal technology from the University of South Florida.
 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depending on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 
A summary of the licensed patents is as follows:
 

Title of Patent | Patent Type | Therapeutic Drug | Date Filed | Date Issued | Expiration Date | Patent # 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------+----------
Lithium Cocrystals and an Additional Neuropsychiatric Agent for Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders | Method of Use | AL001 (LISPRO) | 05/21/2016 | 03/28/2017 | 05/21/2036 | 9,603,869
Organic Anion Lithium Ionic Cocrystal Compounds and Compositions | Composition of Matter | AL001 (LISPRO) | 04/18/2014 | 12/12/2017 | 04/18/2034 | 9,840,521
Amyloid Beta Peptides and Methods of Use | Composition of Matter | AL002 (E22W) | 10/12/2007 | 05/29/2012 | 02/12/2028 | 8,188,046

 
While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we take security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, there can be no assurance that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that our employees, consultants or any third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets and other proprietary rights or that measures we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
 
In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or ourselves, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
We currently have four trademarks registered with the USPTO that include our corporate name, Alzamend Neuro, two for our corporate slogan and one for our trade name.
 
Our Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we have some, albeit limited, development experience and scientific knowledge, we will face competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies, as well as academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions, among others.
 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. It is likely that the timing of market introductions of some of our potential products or our competitors’ products will be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our products, conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials to obtain approval and manufacture or obtain supplies of commercial quantities of any approved products should also be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on additional factors such as product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of April 30, 2022, we have four full-time employees (Stephan Jackman, our Chief Executive Officer, Lien T. Escalona, our Chief Financial Officer, Bradford Sullivan, our Director of Investor Relations, and Kraingsak Roajphlastien, our Senior Operations Manager) and four part-time employees. We also utilize independent consultants to assist us in our medical research and development projects.
