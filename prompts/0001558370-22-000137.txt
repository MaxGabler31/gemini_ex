Item 1.BUSINESS
General
Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company. We design, manufacture, and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control (“CNC”)) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service, and distribution network. Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components. Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products. We also provide machine tool components, automation integration equipment and solutions for job shops, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service, training, and applications support. As used in this report, the words “we”, “us”, “our”, “Hurco” and the “Company” refer to Hurco Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
​
Since our founding in 1968, we have been a leader in the introduction of interactive computer control systems that automate manufacturing processes and improve productivity in the metal parts manufacturing industry. We pioneered the application of microprocessor technology and conversational programming software for use in machine tools. Our Hurco brand computer control systems can be operated by both skilled and unskilled machine tool operators and, yet, are capable of instructing a machine to perform complex tasks. The combination of microprocessor technology and patented interactive, conversational programming software in our proprietary computer control systems enables operators on the production floor to quickly and easily create a program for machining a particular part from a blueprint or computer aided design file, and immediately begin machining that part. 
​
Our executive offices and principal design and engineering operations are headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. We have sales, application engineering, and service subsidiaries in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. We have manufacturing and assembly operations in Taiwan, the U.S., Italy, and China, and distribution facilities in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Taiwan. 
​
Our strategy is to design, manufacture, and sell a comprehensive line of computerized machine tools that help customers in the worldwide metal cutting market increase productivity and profitability. The majority of our machine tools employ proprietary, interactive computer control technology that increases productivity through ease of operation via interactive conversational and graphical programming software. All of our machine tools, regardless of brand, deliver high levels of machine performance (speed, accuracy and surface finish quality) that increases productivity. We routinely expand our product offerings to meet customer needs, which has led us to design and manufacture more complex machining centers with advanced capabilities. We bring a disciplined approach to strategically enter new geographic markets, as appropriate.
​

​



Our strategic plans focus on market expansion to reach more customers with more products on a global basis. We have made five acquisitions since 2013, and the products we have added through these acquisitions have given us more advanced products with unprecedented improvements in our machine tool accuracy and precision, allow us to seek higher productivity in complex manufacturing environments, provide automation for machine tending solutions, and minimize dependencies associated with volatilities from economic and geographic cyclicality. While the Hurco-branded computer control systems have been, and continue to be, our premium flagship product line, we have added other products to our portfolio that provide product diversity and market penetration opportunity priced from entry-level to high performance serving a variety of different industries. We have not changed our overall strategy to design, manufacture, and sell a comprehensive line of computerized machine tools; rather, we have enhanced this strategy through growth both organically and through acquisitions in an effort to attain long-term stability and profitability.
​
During fiscal 2021, our sales and service fees were $235.2 million, an increase of $64.6 million, or 38%, compared to fiscal 2020 and included a favorable currency impact of $7.7 million, or 5%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. For fiscal 2021, we reported net income of $6.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $6.2 million, or $(0.93) per diluted share, for fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, sales increased year-over-year for all product brands and in all regions as countries began to lift the government-mandated COVID-19 stay-at-home orders or other similar operating restrictions put in place in fiscal 2020. The net loss for fiscal 2020 included a one-time $4.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge attributable primarily to the then prolonged ongoing uncertainty in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
​
Industry
Machine tool products are considered capital goods, which makes them part of an industry that has historically been highly cyclical.
Industry association data for the U.S. machine tool market is available, and that market accounts for approximately 13% of worldwide consumption. Reports available for the U.S. machine tool market include:

• | United States Machine Tool Consumption – generated by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, this report includes metal cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Purchasing Manager’s Index – developed by the Institute for Supply Management, this report includes activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that purchase machine tools; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capacity Utilization of Manufacturing Companies – issued by the Federal Reserve Board.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A limited amount of information is available for foreign markets, and different reporting methodologies are used by various countries. Machine tool consumption data, published by the Association of Manufacturing Technology (“AMT”), calculates machine tool consumption annually by country. It is important to note that data for foreign countries are based on government reports that may lag 6 to 12 months behind real-time and, therefore, are unreliable for forecasting purposes.
​
Demand for capital equipment can fluctuate significantly during periods of changing economic conditions. Manufacturers and suppliers of capital goods, such as our company, are often the first to experience these changes in demand. Additionally, since build to stock and our typical order backlog is approximately 45 days, it is difficult to estimate demand with any reasonable certainty. Therefore, we do not have the benefit of relying on the common leading indicators that other industries use for market analysis and forecasting purposes.

Hurco CNC Machine Tools
​
Hurco computerized machine tools are equipped with a fully integrated interactive computer control system that features our proprietary WinMax® software. Our computer control system enables a machine tool operator to create complex two-dimensional (“2D”) or three-dimensional (“3D”) machining programs directly from an engineering drawing or computer-aided design geometry file, such as a solid model. An operator with little or no machine tool programming experience can successfully create a program with minimal training and begin machining the part in a short period of time.  The control features an operator console with a touch-screen, and incorporates an upgradeable personal computer (“PC”) platform using a high-speed processor with solid rendering graphical programming.  In addition, WinMax® has a Windows®† based operating system that enables users to improve shop floor flexibility and software productivity. Companies using computer-controlled machine tools are better able to:
​

● | maximize the efficiency of their human resources;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | make more advanced and complex parts from a wide range of materials using multiple processes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | incorporate fast moving changes in technology into their operations to keep their competitive edge; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | integrate their business into the global supply chain of their customers by supporting small to medium lot sizes for “just in time” initiatives.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Windows® based Hurco control facilitates our ability to meet these customer needs. The familiar Windows® operating system coupled with our intuitive conversational style of program creation allows our customers’ operators to create and edit part-making programs without incurring the incremental overhead of specialized computer aided design (“CAD”) and computer aided manufacturing (“CAM”) programmers. With the ability to transfer most CAD data directly into a Hurco program, programming time can be significantly reduced.
​
Machine tool products must be designed to meet customer demand to machine complex parts with greater part accuracies.  Our proprietary controls with WinMax® software and high-speed processors efficiently handle the large amounts of data these complex part-making programs require and enable our customers to create parts with higher accuracy at faster speeds. We continue to add technology to our control design as it becomes available. UltiMotion®, our patented motion control system, provides significant cycle time reductions and increases the quality of a part’s surface finish. This technology differentiates us in the marketplace and is incorporated into our control.

​
Other Control Systems, Software, and Accessories
​
The following machine tool computer control systems and software products are sold directly to end-users and/or to other original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”).
​
Autobend®
Our Autobend® computer control systems are applied to metal bending press brake machines that form parts from sheet metal and steel plate.  They consist of a microprocessor-based computer control and back gauge (an automated gauging system that determines where the bend will be made).  We have manufactured and sold the Autobend® product line since 1968.  We currently market two models of our Autobend® computer control systems for press brake machines, in combination with six different back gauges as retrofit units for installation on existing or new press brake machines.
​
Software Products
In addition to our standard computer control features, we offer software option products for part programming.  These products are sold to users of our Hurco computerized machine tools equipped with our dual touch-screen or single touch-screen consoles featuring WinMax® control software.  Each international division packages the options as appropriate for its market. The most common options include: Advanced Verification Graphics, Swept Surface, DXF Transfer, 3D DXF and Solid Model Import, UltiMonitor, UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets, Conversational Part and Tool Probing, Tool and Material Library, NC/Conversational Merge, Job List, Automation Job Manager, Stream Load, Active Thermal Compensation, Thread Repair, and Simultaneous Five-Axis Contouring. 
​
The Advanced Verification Graphics option displays a picture of the rendered part on the screen of the control that can be viewed from any angle. The detail allows the customer to evaluate how the part is programmed to be machined before cutting commences, which eliminates the need to scrap expensive material.
​
Solid Model Import with 3D DXF Technology automatically uses geometry from a 3D CAD model to easily create conversational programs for 2D and 3D parts or even 3+2 and 5-sided parts. 
​
Our Swept Surface software option simplifies programming of 3D contours and significantly reduces programming time. 

13
​



The DXF Transfer software option increases operator productivity because it eliminates manual data entry of part features by transferring AutoCAD®* drawing files directly into our computer control or into our desktop programming software, WinMax® Desktop.
​
Designed to take advantage of the IoT, UltiMonitor is a web-based productivity, management, and service tool that enables customers to monitor, inspect, and receive notifications about their Hurco machines from any location where they can access the internet. Customers can transfer part designs, receive event notifications via email for text, access diagnostic data, monitor the machine via webcam, and communicate with the machine operator.
​
UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets automatically calculates the tool path around islands, eliminating the arduous task of plotting these shapes.  Islands can also be rotated, scaled and repeated.
​
Conversational Part and Tool Probing options permit the computerized dimensional measurement of machined parts and the associated cutting tools.  This “on-machine” technique improves the throughput of the measurement process when compared to traditional “off-machine” approaches.
​
The Tool and Material Library option stores the tool and material information with the machine instead of storing it with each individual part program. The user enters the tool data and geometry one time and chooses the particular tool from the list when it is needed. Additionally, the library reads the part program and automatically locates the tool or displays an alert if the tool does not exist. In addition to saving time, the Tool and Material Library eliminates the need to enter information repeatedly and can prevent common tool crash conditions.
