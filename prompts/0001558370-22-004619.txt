Overview
We are a pre-revenue stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and advancement of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of pain from osteoarthritis. 
Ampion, our lead product candidate, has unique immunomodulatory action and anti-inflammatory effects, which may provide a treatment for individuals with inflammatory conditions including, but not limited to, severe osteoarthritis of the knee (“OAK”), osteoarthritis related to other joints (i.e., hip, shoulder, ankle and hand), and the widespread inflammation associated with COVID-19 infection. 
Ampion is currently in development as an intra-articular injection treatment for severe OAK, an intravenous (“IV”) and inhaled treatment for hospitalized severe and/or critical COVID-19 patients, and an at-home inhalation treatment for patients with prolonged respiratory symptoms due to COVID-19, commonly referred to as “Long-COVID.” Clinical development of Ampion is advancing through several clinical trials in the United States and abroad. We are currently conducting and involved in the ongoing management of four discrete clinical trials; all of which are at various stages of completion. The clinical trials in progress as of December 31, 2021 are as follows: 

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--
Study Name | | Title | 
AP-013 | ​ | A Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of an Intra-Articular Injection of Ampion in Adults with Pain Due to Severe Osteoarthritis of the Knee | ​
AP-017 | ​ | A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Ampion in Adult COVID-19 Patients Requiring Oxygen Supplementation | ​

AP-018 | ​ | A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ampion in Patients with Prolonged Respiratory Symptoms due to COVID-19 (Long-COVID) | ​

​
In addition, we continue our research and discovery efforts for additional Ampion applications. Laboratory results suggest that Ampion may have the potential to treat a wide variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Pre-clinical and discovery work is also underway for additional applications and indications for Ampion.
​
Our therapeutic product pipeline is the result of more than two decades of research at leading hospital-based research centers. Significant discoveries in both scientific and clinical research have been published in peer-reviewed journals, highlighting the depth of research supporting Ampion’s therapeutic capabilities. Ampion is backed by an extensive and robust United States and global patent portfolio with intellectual property protection extending through 2037 for OAK and 2041 for use of Ampion to treat viral respiratory conditions, including COVID-19. In addition, we believe that if approved as a novel biologic, Ampion may be eligible for 12-year FDA market exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.
​
AMPION 
​
We have developed a novel biologic drug, Ampion, which contains active ingredients that target multiple pathways in the innate immune response characteristic of inflammatory disease. In vitro studies in human cellular models have shown that Ampion represses the transcription of proteins responsible for inflammation, while activating anti-inflammatory proteins responsible for signaling tissue growth and healing. Ampion achieves its biological effect by targeting the elevated inflammatory cytokines, which is common in multiple inflammatory diseases like osteoarthritis and respiratory disease, and other infectious and inflammatory conditions. Ampion has been shown to uniquely reduce inflammation along multiple pathways, unlike other anti-inflammatory therapies that target only one mechanism.

Ampion has been developed for use, and has been cleared by the FDA for investigation, in multiple routes of administration.


● | Intra-articular injection places Ampion right where it is needed to locally treat inflammation. The OAK trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection into the knee joint.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inhalation provides direct application of Ampion to locally treat inflammation in the lungs. Certain COVID-19 clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ampion inhalation in the lungs of COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress and Long-COVID, which is supported by top-line results from the AP-014 study, our initial Phase 1 trial for this indication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Intravenous administration provides systemic application of Ampion to broadly treat inflammation throughout the body. An additional COVID-19 clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ampion IV treatment in hospitalized severe and critical COVID-19 patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe that the Ampion mechanism of action provides a therapeutic effect by interrupting the dysregulated immune system responsible for the disease, damage, and pain attributed to many inflammatory and degenerative conditions. We consider Ampion to be a platform drug which could be developed to treat an array of inflammatory diseases throughout the body. 
​
Ampion for Osteoarthritis 
Ampion targets the cellular pathways in the innate immune response correlated with pain, inflammation, and joint damage from osteoarthritis. As described above, in vitro studies have shown that Ampion represses the transcription of inflammatory cytokines responsible for inflammation, while activating anti-inflammatory proteins responsible for tissue growth and healing. We believe that this mechanism of action interrupts the disease process responsible for the pain and disability associated with OAK while providing market expansion potential as a disease-modifying biologic drug.

We are currently developing Ampion as an intra-articular injection to treat the signs and symptoms of severe OAK, which continues to affect an increasing number of patients in the United States and other countries worldwide. OAK is a progressive disease characterized by gradual degradation and loss of cartilage due to inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the knee joint. Progression of the most severe form of OAK leaves patients with little or no treatment options other than a total knee arthroplasty. The FDA has asserted that severe OAK is an “unmet medical need” with no existing licensed therapy available. While we believe that Ampion could successfully treat this “unmet medical need,” our ability to market this product is subject to FDA approval in the United States and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities worldwide.
Osteoarthritis Market Opportunity
Osteoarthritis (“OA”) is the most common form of arthritis, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), OA affects over 32.5 million adults in the United States. It is a progressive and debilitating disease of the joints involving degradation of the intra-articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. Certain risk factors in conjunction with natural wear and tear lead to the breakdown of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is caused by inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of intra-articular cartilage. Other progressive effects include narrowing of the joint space, synovial membrane thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of the subchondral bone. Based on Research and Markets’ “Osteoarthritis Treatment Market – Growth, Trends, COVID-19 impact, and Forecasts (2021 – 2026),” the OA treatment market was valued at approximately $5.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $8.2 billion by 2026, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.8% from 2020 to 2026. The global demand for OAK treatment is expected to be fueled by aging demographics and increased awareness of treatment options. Despite the size and growth of the OAK market, only a few viable treatment options currently exist, with none labeled specifically for the patient population with severe disease. 
Ampion Development for OAK 
Since our inception, we have conducted multiple clinical trials and have advanced through late-stage clinical trials in the United States, initially under the guidance of the FDA’s Office of Blood Research and Review and most recently under the guidance of the FDA’s Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies.
The AP-003-A study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial of 329 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive Ampion or saline control via intra-articular injection. The study showed a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to the control, with an average of greater than 40% reduction in pain from baseline at 12 weeks with Ampion treatment. Patients who received Ampion also showed a significant improvement in function and quality of life at 12 weeks compared to patients who received the saline control. Quality of life was assessed using Patient Global Assessment. Furthermore, the trial included severely diseased patients, defined radiographically as Kellgren Lawrence Grade 4 (“KL 4”). From this patient population, those patients who received Ampion had a significantly greater 

9




reduction in pain than those who received the saline control. Ampion was well tolerated with minimal adverse events reported in either the Ampion or saline treated groups. There were no drug-related serious adverse events in either group.
In 2018, the FDA confirmed that our Phase 3 pivotal trial, AP-003-A, was adequate and well-controlled, provided evidence of the effectiveness of Ampion and could contribute to the substantial evidence of effectiveness needed for the approval of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). In addition, the FDA provided guidance that we should complete an additional Phase 3 trial of severe OAK patients with concurrent controls to support a marketing application of Ampion for OAK patients.
AP-013 study
​
The AP-013 study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 1,043 patients with severe OAK who were randomized 1:1 to receive Ampion or saline control via intra-articular (“IA”) injection. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the effects of Ampion treatment on pain and function. The study was sized to detect superiority of treatment in the co-primary endpoint of function, which required a larger study (i.e., 1,034 patients) than required for pain alone (approximately 500 patients provides more than 85% power). 
​
The AP-013 study was initiated in June 2019 and was ongoing when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency (“PHE”) on January 31, 2020 and the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. The AP-013 study was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as was the case with many clinical studies being conducted at that time. The study was paused in April 2020 due to patient and site safety concerns about COVID-19, the inability of sites to support remote visits, and the resulting unanimous recommendation from the study’s safety monitoring committee given the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conduct of the study and its participants. 
​
The FDA acknowledged the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials in the “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” which outlined the FDA’s guidance to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of clinical trial participants, complying with good clinical practice (“GCP”), and minimizing risks to clinical trial integrity during the outbreak. The FDA also issued an update to its Guidance for Industry regarding the statistical principles for sensitivity analysis in clinical trials. In discussions with the FDA, the agency recommended that we identify subject information that was impacted by the pandemic during the AP-013 study and conduct a sensitivity analysis to detect potential bias related to the pandemic. Following this guidance, we initiated close-out of the study, locked the database, and conducted a preliminary analysis. These preliminary results were communicated in a press release on September 15, 2021, and as stated at that time, a more thorough analysis of the data was subsequently performed for presentation to the FDA.
​
Early in the first quarter of 2022, we completed these additional analyses in consideration of FDA feedback and guidance documents and requested a Type C meeting with the FDA. In our meeting request, we presented the results of the recommended sensitivity analysis, which suggested the clinical trial data in the full set of randomized patients, which is known as the intention to treat (“ITT”) population, was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001). The currently analyzed results of the AP-013 study show that statistical superiority of Ampion as compared with saline was not observed in the ITT population, which was likely due to the substantial number of missing visits and large amounts of data imputation required to assess efficacy, particularly for patients enrolled after the declaration of the PHE. The missing data similarly effected both arms of the study. This substantial amount of missing data would impact the estimation of the treatment effect, and per study plans, triggered the use of a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) efficacy analysis population, which was also presented to the FDA in the request for a meeting. 
​
The detailed analyses using the proposed mITT population (n=618 patients), which was based in part on randomization date to determine impact of COVID-19, demonstrated a significant reduction in pain (p=0.042) with trends towards functional improvement (Ampion treatment was numerically better than saline) in severely diseased OAK patients. Sensitivity and robustness analyses showed the proposed mITT population was not impacted by COVID-19, required less imputation due to missing visits, and preserved randomization, which supports the use of the mITT for the evaluation of efficacy. 
​
In addition, the Per-Protocol population (“PP”) is defined in the AP-013 study protocol to include all patients from the full set of randomized patients who did not have major protocol violations. By definition, this minimizes the substantial amounts of missing data due to COVID-19, which impacted the ITT estimation of the treatment effect. Analysis using 

10




this PP population (n=580) demonstrated statistical superiority of Ampion compared with saline for both the endpoints of pain (p=0.020) and function (p=0.027). 
​
Ampio believes that the AP-013 results using the mITT analysis, supported by the PP analysis, confirm the results from the first pivotal AP-003-A study. The AP-013 mITT efficacy population, analyses, and impact on the study due to COVID-19, will be discussed with the FDA in the first half of 2022. Despite the influence of COVID-19, we believe the analysis of the AP-013 study retained sufficient power and preserved randomization in order to assess the treatment of pain due to OAK. Ampio maintains that the results of these analyses support Ampion as a clinically meaningful treatment option for severely diseased OAK patients. 
​
Additionally, a preliminary integrated analysis of the proposed AP-013 mITT population combined with severe OAK subjects from previous Ampion clinical trials randomized 1:1 with Ampion or saline control, which included over 1,000 patients, indicated that subjects treated with Ampion had a statistically significant improvement in pain and function as compared to those treated with saline.
​
Ampion has been administered via IA injection in the knee to more than 1,500 patients, including over 1,000 severe OAK patients, and the side effects have been mild and not related to Ampion. The safety data demonstrates the benefits for Ampion treatment do not come at an increased risk to safety. Our review of publicly available literature supports a conclusion that the rate of adverse events for Ampion treatment, including in patients with severe OAK, is more favorable than that observed in currently marketed products used for pain due to OAK. Proposed label indications will be discussed with the FDA when a license application is submitted for review.
​
We cannot know the potential outcome of the review of this data by the FDA. The submission of data does not provide assurance that the FDA will agree that we are in position to file the BLA, that the FDA will accept our BLA for Ampion when submitted, or that our trial results will be adequate to support approval. Those issues will be addressed during the review of the submitted application and are determined based on the adequacy and merit of the overall submission. Final determinations for marketing application approval are made after a complete review of the marketing application and are based on the entirety of the data provided in the application. If the FDA requires us to perform an additional clinical trial, this circumstance would significantly change our future contractual commitments. Depending on the length of the review period prior to BLA approval, there could be a potential adverse impact on the assumed 12-year exclusivity in the event a like-kind biologic is approved and enters the market prior to the approval of Ampion.  
​
Ampion for COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of cases and deaths worldwide. Once infected, the COVID-19 virus can move into a patient’s respiratory tract where the lungs may become inflamed. This can make breathing difficult, requiring treatment with oxygen, and in some cases result in death. We believe it is imperative that effective therapeutic treatments are identified and developed to combat the damaging inflammation and clinical effects resulting from COVID-19 infection.
Nonclinical in vitro studies show Ampion decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines associated with the hyperactive inflammatory response present during COVID-19 infection. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are correlated with COVID-19 severity and may also trigger additional complications including pneumonia, Acute Lung Injury (“ALI”) and/or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (“ARDS”), which are leading causes of mortality from COVID-19. By targeting and reducing the production of these inflammatory cytokines, Ampion may improve the clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19.
Due to its mode of action, Ampion may be a viable treatment option for those infected with COVID-19 to improve clinical outcomes and decrease the progression and severity of associated COVID-19 inflammatory conditions (i.e., COVID-19 pneumonia, ALI, ARDS, and ultimately mortality). Accordingly, Ampion may provide an option for COVID-19 patients.
As an immunomodulatory agent, we believe that Ampion may be effective in improving the clinical course and outcome for COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 Market Opportunity
​
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in multiple millions of cases and deaths worldwide with figures continuing to reflect significant expansion of the pandemic. Complications of severe COVID-19 infection include ARDS, ALI, pneumonia, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury and prolonged hospitalization for other complications (i.e., secondary bacterial infection). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to transform the growth of various industries and the immediate market impact varies. The global demand for COVID-19 therapeutics is expected to be fueled by the continued mutations of the virus and the desire for multiple types of treatment options. We believe that it is imperative that effective treatments are identified and developed to address the full spectrum of clinical features of COVID-19 infection, from the need for oxygen to the progression to ARDS, and Long-COVID. 
​
Ampion Development for Treating COVID-19 Induced Inflammation 
Ampion is in development as a novel biologic drug that regulates multiple therapeutic targets in the innate immune system responsible for the inflammation, tissue damage and pathogenesis associated with dysregulated immune disorders. Due to its mode of action, Ampion may be a viable treatment option for those infected with COVID-19 to improve clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 inflammatory conditions (i.e., progression to respiratory failure, the need for assisted breathing and ultimately mortality). A number of treatments for acute COVID-19 have been approved, and previously approved therapies are being successfully used in COVID-19, and global vaccination programs are underway, alongside unpredictable mutations of the virus (new variants), and together these are altering the clinical manifestations of the disease and the market for treatments.
​
Ampion is currently in development under active Investigational New Drug applications (“INDs”) with the FDA as an IV and inhalation treatment for COVID-19 patients. In late 2020, we announced the results of the AP-016 study, which met its primary endpoint and found Ampion to be safe and well-tolerated with no significant differences in the incidence, frequency, and severity of adverse events between IV Ampion and the Standard of Care (“SOC”). Secondary efficacy endpoints from the study suggest Ampion may improve the clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 as measured by the ordinal scale of clinical improvement, as recommended by the World Health Organization (the “WHO”). 
​
In April 2021, we announced the results from 40 patients in the Phase 1 study, AP-014, titled “A Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Nebulized Ampion In Adults with Respiratory Distress Secondary to COVID-19 Infection”. The AP-014 study met its primary safety endpoint, and showed an improvement in all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with inhaled Ampion treatment and SOC, over patients treated using only SOC. Specifically, mortality in the SOC group was 24% while the group also treated with inhaled Ampion had a mortality rate of only 5%, representing an almost 80% improvement.
​
Other key findings from the AP-014 study continue to show a positive outcome for patients treated with inhaled Ampion and SOC including:
​

• | Patients who received Ampion required less hospitalization time. The average hospital stay was four days less for the Ampion group compared to the patients receiving SOC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients treated with Ampion were either stable or showed improvement on a scale of clinical improvement compared to patients treated using SOC. By day five, 89% of patients who received Ampion were stable or had improvement compared to 77% of patients who received SOC. This trend in improvement with Ampion treatment is noted as early as day two and continues to day five.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ampion treatment was safe and well-tolerated in all patients. There were no significant adverse events with Ampion treatment and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
​
AP-017 study – IV Ampion treatment
Following the results of the AP-016 study, we discussed with the FDA a potential Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) of IV Ampion treatment for COVID-19 patients and the agency recommended we conduct a Phase 2 study in COVID-19 patients. The Phase 2 study, AP-017, titled “A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Ampion in Adult COVID-19 Patients Requiring Oxygen Supplementation” commenced enrollment in July 2021. The study is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients and we have completed an interim analysis at 30 patients for sample size re-estimation. We have noted very slow enrollment 

12




due to low COVID admission rates at the participating centers and competing studies. There has been an increase in the number of approved medications to treat COVID-19 and its complications raising the bar for EUA approval. A substantial investment to increase the number of study sites in other countries would be required to complete enrollment. The progression to mechanical ventilation or death has been lower than observed earlier in the pandemic and consequently a subsequent much larger phase 3 clinical trial will be required to document efficacy. Based on the changing impact of COVID-19 as discussed above, we have determined that it is prudent to terminate enrollment and analyze the data completely to determine next steps for the use of IV Ampion. We believe an excellent safety profile of IV Ampion has been documented that will support IV use in COVID-19 and other indications.
​
AP-019 study – Inhaled Ampion treatment
This data was also presented to the FDA for guidance for inhaled Ampion treatment as a potential EUA therapy. The FDA provided guidance and recommended that we proceed to a Phase 2 study in COVID-19 patients. In June 2021, we commenced enrollment in the U.S. in the Phase 2 study, AP-019, titled “A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Ampion in Adults with Respiratory Distress Due to COVID-19”. The study is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients and utilizes an interim analysis at 150 patients for sample size re-estimation as needed. In September 2021, we received regulatory approval from the Drugs Controller General of India, and we expanded enrollment to India shortly thereafter. We have completed the enrollment for the interim analysis and await data entry. We will determine the next steps for the study when the data has been analyzed.
​
AP-018 study
In March 2021, we initiated the AP-018 study, titled “A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ampion in Patients with Prolonged Respiratory Symptoms due to COVID-19 (Long-COVID),” as an “at home” inhaled Ampion therapeutic treatment. This study was initiated in response to a growing concern that an increasing number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 are experiencing ongoing effects including, but not limited to, prolonged respiratory complications months after the onset of the disease, also known as PASC, Long-COVID, and/or long-hauler syndrome. This study enrolled 32 patients and aims to evaluate the safety of Ampion and the clinical outcomes in patients with Long-COVID. We completed in December 2021, and are currently performing Day 60 post-treatment safety/efficacy measures, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. We will then finalize the study results and determine next steps for this program.
​
Due to the global pandemic and the need for new treatments, regulatory authorities are applying emergency approval programs. These programs include the EUA program in the United States. Our COVID-19 studies are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ampion treatment in COVID-19 patients. The analysis of the COVID-19 study data will determine if we decide to seek an EUA from the FDA for the use of Ampion for COVID-19 patients. A separate regulatory process will be needed in order to obtain a full marketing authorization (i.e., non-emergency authorization) for the use of Ampion in COVID-19 patients.
​
Ampion Manufacturing Facility
In May 2014, we commenced a 125-month lease of a multi-purpose facility containing approximately 19,000 square feet. This facility includes quality control and research laboratories, our corporate offices and approximately 3,000 square feet of modular clean rooms to manufacture Ampion.
Since the manufacturing site has been operational, we have implemented a quality system for both U.S. and European Union (“EU”) regulatory compliance, validated the facility for human-use products, produced Ampion and placebo for use in the inception-to-date clinical trials, and successfully produced a significant number of vials of Ampion, which we believe would support the BLA filing.
The manufacturing facility utilizes automated equipment with single-use line sets and modular clean rooms designed to maximize flexibility and scalability while meeting international quality standards to initially satisfy the demand expected in connection with a global launch of the product. We believe that with our direct control and management of the manufacturing process, we are in a strong position to deliver a competitive cost of goods that is significantly lower than the industry benchmark. Additionally, we estimate that the maximum capacity for our existing facility is approximately 8 million 5 mL vials per year. An independent third-party has conducted a quality audit of the Ampion manufacturing 

13




facility, which confirmed that our facility is expected to meet the requirements of an FDA pre-approval inspection for the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls required for a BLA approval.

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope of regulatory approvals; government and third party reimbursement rates for, and the average selling price of products; the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent rights and their protection; and sales and marketing capabilities.
Market acceptance of Ampion will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) its potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies; (ii) the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products; (iii) the effectiveness of our sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities and/or those of any partner(s); and (iv) the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.
Although we believe Ampion possesses attractive attributes, it may not receive regulatory approval or market acceptance, and we may not be able to compete effectively in the pharmaceutical drug markets. If Ampion fails to gain regulatory approvals and acceptance in its intended markets, we may not generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitability.
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending BLA, adverse facility inspection reports (Form 483), untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

Pharmaceutical and biologic product development in the United States typically involves: 

● | the performance of satisfactory preclinical laboratory and animal studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), regulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes, which conform to the FDA mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), including a quality system regulating manufacturing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission and acceptance of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining the approval of Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) at each clinical trial site to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA for review and approval of a BLA, depending on the product’s components, intended effect, and claims.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as certain animal studies to assess its safety. Results of these preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information (in compliance with GLP and cGMP), analytical data and the clinical trial protocol (detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated), must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials can begin.
An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trial and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. Preclinical studies generally take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing clinical testing to begin. While the IND sponsor and/or clinical trial sponsor may transfer its obligations to third parties, the sponsor ultimately remains responsible for the proper management, documentation and reporting in connection with the clinical trials and the investigational drug, and if the sponsor fails to provide the necessary management and oversight, or if the sponsor or third parties do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, product development, submission and approval may be adversely impacted. Each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or Ethics Committee (“EC”) for sites located outside of the United States. The IRB/EC considers, among other things, ethical factors, and the selection and safety of human subjects. Clinical trials for use in support of a BLA must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements. The FDA and/or IRB/EC may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial or a specific clinical trial site to be halted at any time, or impose other sanctions for failure to comply with requirements under the appropriate entity jurisdiction.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Ampio is seeking a BLA for Ampion’s treatment of severe OAK. In Phase 1 clinical trials, a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used. The main purpose of the trial is to assess a product candidate’s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate. Phase 1 clinical trials generally include fewer than 50 subjects or patients. During Phase 2 trials, a product candidate is studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to: (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product candidate for specific target diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for Phase 3 trials. Phase 3 trials are generally undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. Phase 3 trials will generally be designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate’s clinical efficacy and provide adequate information for labeling of the biologic.

15




After successful completion of clinical testing under an IND, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most of these applications are subject to an application user fee, currently approximately $3.1 million. However, the FDA will waive the application user fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. Small businesses are defined as businesses with fewer than 500 employees, therefore Ampio believes that it will be considered a small business and intends to submit a small business waiver for waiver of the BLA application user fee. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved BLA are also subject to an annual program fee, currently approximately $370,000. The annual program fee replaced the product and establishment user fees that the FDA charged in prior years. These fees typically increase annually.
The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. The FDA has committed to a goal of 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Applications for standard biologic products are typically reviewed within ten months; most applications that have been granted priority review are reviewed in six months. There are accelerated review processes at the FDA, including Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval, none of which Ampio is currently seeking.
The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider BLA amendments, including certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or the facilities where the biologic is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe and effective for the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it will issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of the BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Product approval also may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
We have advanced through late-stage clinical trials on Ampion for the treatment of OAK in the United States. Nevertheless, our current regulatory strategy may not secure the final regulatory approval of Ampion for the chosen product indications. In addition, the approval(s) if obtained, may take longer than anticipated. We can provide no assurance that Ampion will prove to be safe or effective. Ampion may not receive required regulatory approvals, or, if approved, may not be successfully commercialized. A subsequent regulatory process is required to lead to full marketing approval and may require additional clinical trials.

Emergency Use Authorization
Under FDCA Section 564, in the event that the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declares a public health emergency and implements emergency use authorizations, the FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by certain threats when specified criteria are met. FDA issuance of an EUA for unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products is subject to statutory conditions relating, in part, to potential effectiveness and the lack of approved alternatives. The “may be effective” standard for EUAs is a lower standard than the typical requirements for BLA approval, and it is applied by the FDA on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis based on the totality of the available scientific evidence. 
Once authorized, an EUA generally remains effective until the Secretary of HHS terminates the emergency use authorization declaration (with sufficient advance notice beforehand), or the product or its authorized use is no longer unapproved. The data from our studies, which we are currently analyzing, may not secure Emergency Use Authorization for Ampion for the chosen product indications. In addition, if one or more EUAs are obtained, it may take longer than anticipated. We can provide no assurance that Ampion will prove to be potentially effective with a favorable risk-benefit analysis, will receive an EUA, or if authorized, how long the EUA will remain effective or if the product will be successfully commercialized. A subsequent regulatory process is required to lead to full marketing approval and may require additional clinical trials.
Foreign Regulatory Approval
Outside of the United States, our ability to market Ampion will be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The Common Technical Document used to assemble the Quality, Safety, and Efficacy information for submission of an Ampion BLA in the United States is currently recognized throughout Europe, Canada and Japan. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain the requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and may differ from those required for FDA approval. 
Under EU regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. The mutual recognition process results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state and each concerned member state. 
We will seek to choose the appropriate route of European regulatory filing in an attempt to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals for Ampion when ready for review. However, the chosen regulatory strategy may not secure regulatory approval of Ampion for the chosen product indications. In addition, these approvals, if obtained, may take longer than anticipated. We can provide no assurance that Ampion will prove to be safe or effective or will not require a different clinical trial or trials from those that satisfy the FDA. Ampion may not receive required regulatory approvals, or, if approved, may not be successfully commercialized.

BPCIA and Exclusivity
In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the “Affordable Care Act”), which was signed into law in 2010, included a subtitle known as the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”). The BPCIA grants a novel biologic, or reference product, 12 years of market exclusivity. 
We believe that Ampion is currently a novel biologic product and, as such, we believe it will be eligible to receive 12 years of market exclusivity as measured from the FDA approval date, if approved.
Post-Approval Regulation
If a product candidate receives FDA regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications. Furthermore, after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers always will be found in compliance with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals.
If the FDA approves our BLA, we and the manufacturers of clinical supplies and commercial supplies must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs, or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a biologic product must also be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. In addition, we were prohibited from promoting our products off-label. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter or untitled letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory requirements and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state, and local agencies, including HHS, the Office of Inspector General of HHS and other regulatory bodies. Our current and future partners are subject to many of the same requirements. Although we currently do not have any approved products on the market, our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, customers, and third-party payors, expose us to broadly applicable healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal, state, and foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
The ever-changing compliance environment and the need to comply with different compliance and reporting requirements in more than one jurisdiction increase the possibility that a company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our activities are found to be in violation of any such laws or other applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, the limitation or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participating in federal or state healthcare programs, and/or individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and/or our financial results.
There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several governmental investigations and proposed legislation and regulation to 

18




make product pricing more transparent, to change the relationships in the distribution systems, and to alter reimbursement methodologies for drug products. It is not clear what measures will be in effect if and when our product is approved. If a product is not considered cost-effective compared to other available options, the government or third-party payors may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans, or, if they do, the level of payment permitted may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the product on a profitable basis. Even if a product would be considered cost-effective at approval and could be sold on a profitable basis at that time, other cost and reimbursement changes could be adopted in the future and could harm future revenues. 
In addition, we are subject to other general regulations, including regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and regulations under other federal, state, and local laws.
Violations of any of the foregoing requirements could result in penalties being assessed against us and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and/or our financial results.
Privacy
We may also be subject to federal, state, and foreign data privacy and security laws and regulations. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. Most health care providers, including research institutions from whom we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”). HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities as well as their covered subcontractors. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity or their covered subcontractors. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. 
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Additionally, strict personal privacy laws in other countries affect pharmaceutical companies’ activities in those countries. We also are or will become subject to privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we are established or in which we sell or market our products or run clinical trials. 

19




Although our clinical development efforts are not barred by these privacy regulations, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider that has not satisfied HIPAA’s or the EU’s disclosure standards. Failure by EU clinical trial partners to obey requirements of national laws on private personal data, including laws implementing the EU Data Protection Directive, might result in liability and/or adverse publicity.
Information Systems
We believe that our Information Systems (“IS”) capabilities are adequate to manage our core business. In addition, we believe our internal controls related to IS are operating effectively.
Intellectual Property Summary 
Ampion
We made the decision to focus available resources by limiting the maintenance of patent protection for Ampion based on the relative importance of technologies covered by patents, the geographic jurisdiction of patents and the remaining patent term. This allowed us to reduce the overall number of patents while maintaining our strategic coverage. The portfolio primarily consists of nine families filed in the United States and throughout the world. 
​
The first family includes U.S. patents with claims directed to methods of treating inflammatory diseases with compositions of matter, including Ampion, and claims directed to such compositions of matter. This family also includes issued patents in Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Africa, and Europe (validated in Germany, Great Britain, and France) and pending applications in the United States and Canada. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2024.

The second family includes issued patents and pending applications world-wide, including issued patents in Australia, Canada, China, Russia, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa and Europe (validated in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden), and pending applications in Brazil, Singapore, and the United States. The claims in this family are directed to the treatment of degenerative joint diseases. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2032. 

The third family includes two U.S. patents, a pending U.S. application, issued patents in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Europe (validated in Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Switzerland), and pending applications in Canada and New Zealand with claims directed to the use of Ampion to mobilize, attract, expand and differentiate stem cells in the treatment of subjects. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2034. 

The fourth family includes three U.S. patents, a pending U.S. application, issued patents in Australia, Israel, Japan, and Russia, and pending applications in Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, and Russia with claims directed to the use of Ampion for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases in a multi-dose treatment regimen. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2035. 

The fifth family includes a pending U.S. application and pending applications in Europe and Hong Kong with claims directed to the use of Ampion in the absence of a cyclooxygenase-2 (“COX-2”) antagonist. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2036. 

The sixth family includes a pending U.S. application with claims directed to the use of N-acetyl-kynurenine for treatment of T-cell mediated diseases, degenerative joint disease and diseases mediated by platelet activating factor and composition of matter. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2037.
​
The seventh family includes a pending U.S. application and issued patents in China, Japan and Europe (validated in Germany, Great Britain, and France) with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP to treat conditions, including respiratory conditions, mediated by vascular hyperpermeability. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2031.

20




​
The eighth family includes a pending U.S. application and pending applications in China and Hong Kong with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP to treat conditions, including respiratory conditions, mediated by vascular hyperpermeability. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2037. 
​
The ninth family includes an issued U.S. patent, a pending U.S. application, and a pending PCT application with claims directed to the use of Ampion to treat viral respiratory conditions, including COVID-19. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2041.
​
​
Barriers to Entry – General
We also maintain trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other controls over confidential information. We have sought U.S. and foreign patent protection for our therapeutic product for multiple indications. These patents may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. If we do not adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed.
The patent positions of companies such as ours involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued patents, and those that may be issued to us in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under the patents may not provide us with meaningful protection or competitive advantages. Our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, which could offset any advantages we might otherwise realize from our intellectual property. Furthermore, even if Ampion receives regulatory approval, the time required for development, testing, and regulatory review could mean that protection afforded to us by our patents may only remain in effect for a short period after commercialization. The expiration of patents we hold could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our biologic, thus harming our operating results and financial position.
We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If we must litigate to protect our intellectual property from infringement, we may incur substantial costs and our officers may be forced to devote significant time to litigation-related matters. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Our pending patent applications, or those we may file or license from third parties in the future, may not result in patents being issued. Until a patent is issued, the claims covered by an application for patent may be narrowed or removed entirely, thus depriving us of adequate protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing Ampion to market exceeds the returns we are likely to obtain. We are generally aware of the scientific research being conducted in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts, but patent applications filed by others are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after filing and, in some cases in the U.S., until the patent is issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific literature often occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. As a result, it is possible that patent applications for products similar to our biologic candidate may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and it is possible that development of Ampion could be challenged by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If we become involved in litigation concerning the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, we may incur significant litigation or licensing expenses, be prevented from further developing or commercializing Ampion, be required to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or subject us to compensatory or punitive damage awards. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business.

21




Compliance with Environmental Laws
We believe we are in compliance with current environmental protection requirements that apply to us or our business. Costs attributable to environmental compliance are not currently material.
Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers 
We currently source the key components/raw materials needed to produce Ampion for our clinical trials from the following major suppliers in the industry:

​ | ​ 
--------------------+----------------------------------
Human Serum Albumin | Nova Biologics/Octapharma 
Line Sets | Sartorius Stedim and ThermoFisher
Caps/vials/stoppers | Afton Scientific 

​
We plan to identify secondary suppliers post commercialization to ensure that we can mitigate risk associated with utilizing sole source suppliers. 
Product Liability and Insurance
The development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceutical products involve inherent risks of adverse side effects or reactions that can cause bodily injury or even death. Ampion could adversely affect consumers even after obtaining regulatory approval and, if so, we could be required to withdraw our product from the market or be subject to administrative or other proceedings. We obtain clinical trial liability coverage for human clinical trials, and, if we obtain regulatory approval of Ampion, we will obtain appropriate product liability insurance coverage for Ampion that we manufacture and commercialize for human use. The amount, nature, and pricing of such insurance coverage will likely vary due to a number of factors such as Ampion’s clinical profile, efficacy, and safety record, and other characteristics. We may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to address our exposure to product recall or liability actions, or the cost of that coverage may be such that we will be limited in the types or amount of coverage we can obtain. Any uninsured loss we suffer could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
Human Capital Resources
In order to achieve the goals and expectations of our Company, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits. For example, we pay 100% of our employees’ medical benefits and provide a Company 401(k) employer matching contribution, effective January 1, 2022. In addition, we have implemented a flexible paid time off (“PTO”) policy, which we believe is helpful and essential for our employees to achieve an appropriate work-life balance. 
As of February 15, 2021, we had 21 full-time employees and utilized the services of a number of consultants on a temporary basis. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees and company morale is considered high. As of December 31, 2021, our voluntary turnover was 15% with 20 full-time employees.
Corporate History
Our predecessor, DMI Life Sciences, Inc. (“Life Sciences”), was incorporated in Delaware in December 2008. In March 2010, Life Sciences was merged with a subsidiary of Chay Enterprises, Inc. As a result of this merger, Life Sciences stockholders became the controlling stockholders of Chay Enterprises, Inc. Following the merger, we reincorporated in Delaware as Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in March 2010.
