Corporate Overview
 
Landec Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Landec” or the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture and sell differentiated health and wellness products for food and biomaterials markets. There continues to be a dramatic shift in consumer behavior to healthier eating habits and preventive wellness to improve quality of life. In our Apio, Inc. (“Apio”) Packaged Fresh Vegetable business, we are committed to offering healthy, fresh produce products conveniently packaged to consumers. In our Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (“Lifecore”) Biomaterials business, we develop and commercialize products with our partners that improve the health of people of all ages. In our new O Olive & Vinegar (“O”) business acquired on March 1, 2017, we sell premium California-sourced specialty olive oils and wine vinegar products.
 
Landec’s Packaged Fresh Vegetables and Biomaterials businesses utilize polymer chemistry technology, a key differentiating factor. Both businesses focus on business-to-business markets such as selling directly to retail grocery store chains and club stores for Apio and directly to partners in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets for Lifecore.
 
With the discontinuation of the Food Export business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Landec now has two operating segments – Packaged Fresh Vegetables and Biomaterials, both of which are described below. The results of O are included in the Other segment because it was not significant to Landec’s overall results during fiscal year 2018. Financial information concerning each of these segments for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 is summarized in Note 11 – Business Segment Reporting.
 
Landec was incorporated in California on October 31, 1986 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 6, 2008. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “LNDC”.
 
Description of Business Segments
 
In this Description of Business Segments section, “Apio” and the “Packaged Fresh Vegetables business” will be used interchangeably. The Company decided to discontinue its Food Export segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 in order to focus on its higher margin, differentiated Packaged Fresh Vegetables products. As a result, the operating results for the Food Export business are presented as a discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the financial results for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 have been reclassified to present the Food Export business as a discontinued operation.
A) Packaged Fresh Vegetables Business
 
Apio operates the Packaged Fresh Vegetables business, which combines our proprietary BreatheWay® food packaging technology with the capabilities of a large national food supplier and value-added produce processor which sells products under the Eat Smart® brand to consumers and the GreenLine® brand to foodservice operators, as well as under private labels. In Apio’s Packaged Fresh Vegetables operations, produce is processed by trimming, washing, sorting, blending, and packaging into bags and trays that in most cases incorporate Landec’s BreatheWay membrane technology. The BreatheWay membrane increases shelf-life and reduces shrink (waste) for retailers and helps to ensure that consumers receive fresh produce by the time the product makes its way through the distribution chain. Apio also generates revenue from the sale and/or use of its BreatheWay technology by partners such as Chiquita Brands International, Inc. (“Chiquita”) for packaging and distribution of bananas and berries and Windset Holding 2010 Ltd., a Canadian corporation (“Windset”), for packaging of greenhouse-grown cucumbers and peppers.

The Packaged Fresh Vegetables business had revenues of $455 million for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018, $408 million for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2017, and $424 million for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016.
 
Based in Guadalupe, California, Apio’s primary business is fresh-cut and whole vegetable products typically packaged in our proprietary BreatheWay packaging. Apio’s Packaged Fresh Vegetables business markets a variety of fresh-cut and whole vegetables and salad kit products to retail grocery chains, club stores and food service operators. During the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018, Apio shipped approximately 28 million cartons of produce to its customers throughout North America, primarily in the United States.
 
Most vegetable products packaged in our BreatheWay packaging have an approximately 17-day shelf-life. In addition to packaging innovation, Apio has developed innovative blends and combinations of vegetables that are sold in flexible film bags or rigid trays. More recently, Apio has launched a family of salad kits, salad blends and single serve salads that are comprised of “superfood” mixtures of vegetables with healthy toppings and dressings. The first salad kit to launch under our Eat Smart brand was Sweet Kale Salad, which now has wide distribution throughout club and retail stores in North America. Overall, we are currently selling under our Eat Smart brand 12 salad kits, 5 salad blends and 9 single serve salads. The Company’s expertise includes accessing leading culinary experts and nutritionists nationally to help in the new product development process. We believe that our new products are “on trend” and strong market acceptance supports this belief. Recent statistics show that more than two-thirds of adults are considered to be overweight or obese and more than one-third of adults are considered to be obese. More and more consumers are beginning to make better food choices in their schools, homes and in restaurants and that is where our superfood products can fit into consumers’ daily healthy food choices.
 
In addition to proprietary packaging technology and a strong new product development pipeline, the Company has strong channels of distribution throughout North America with retail grocery store chains and club stores. Landec has one or more of its products in approximately 55% of all retail and club store sites in North America giving us a strong platform for introducing new products. The Company believes it will have growth opportunities for the next several years through new customers, the introduction of innovative products and expansion of its existing customer relationships.
 
The Company sells its products under its nationally-known Eat Smart brand to retail and club stores and its GreenLine brand to foodservice operators. The Company also periodically licenses its BreatheWay packaging technology to partners. These packaging license relationships generate revenues either from product sales or royalties once commercialized. The Company is engaged in the testing and development of other fruits and vegetables that can benefit from the Company’s BreatheWay technology. Landec manufactures its BreatheWay packaging through selected qualified contract manufacturers.
 
 Apio Business Model
 

There are four major distinguishing characteristics of Apio that provide competitive advantages in the Packaged Fresh Vegetables market:
 
Packaged Vegetables Supplier: Apio has structured its business as a marketer and seller of branded and private label blended, fresh-cut and whole vegetable products. It is focused on selling products primarily under its Eat Smart brand, with some sales under its GreenLine brand and private label brands. As retail grocery chains, club stores and food service operators consolidate, Apio is well positioned as a single source of a broad range of products.

Nationwide Processing and Distribution: Apio has strategically invested in its Packaged Fresh Vegetables business. Apio’s largest processing plant is in Guadalupe, CA, and is automated with state-of-the-art vegetable processing equipment in one of the lowest cost, growing regions in California, the Santa Maria Valley. With the acquisition of GreenLine in 2012, Apio added three East Coast processing facilities and five East Coast distribution centers for nationwide delivery of all of its packaged vegetable products in order to meet the next-day delivery needs of customers.
 
Expanded Product Line Using Technology and Unique Blends: Apio is introducing new packaged vegetable products each year, and many of these products use our BreatheWay packaging technology to extend shelf-life. These new product offerings range from various sizes of fresh-cut bagged products, to vegetable trays, to whole produce, to vegetable salads and to snack packs. During fiscal year 2018, Apio introduced fifteen new unique products.
 
Products Currently in Approximately 55% of North American Retail Grocery Stores: Apio has products in approximately 55% of all North American retail grocery stores. This gives Apio the opportunity to sell new products to existing customers and to increase distribution of its approximately 120 unique products within those customers.
Windset
 
The Company believes that hydroponically-grown produce using Windset’s know-how and growing practices will result in higher yields with competitive growing costs that will provide dependable year-round supply to Windset’s customers. See Note 3 – Investment in Non-public Company for further information regarding the Company’s investment in Windset. In addition, the produce grown in Windset’s greenhouses uses significantly less water than field grown crops. Windset owns and operates greenhouses in British Columbia, Canada and California. In addition to growing produce in its own greenhouses, Windset has numerous marketing arrangements with other greenhouse growers and utilizes buy/sell arrangements to meet fluctuation in demand from their customers.
B) Biomaterials Business
 
Lifecore operates our Biomaterials business and is involved in the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate (“HA”) products and providing contract development and aseptic manufacturing services. Sodium hyaluronate is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix in animals and humans. Based upon Lifecore’s expertise working with highly viscous HA, the Company specializes in fermentation and aseptic formulation, filling, and packaging services, as a contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”), for difficult to handle (viscous) medicines filled in finished dose vials and syringes.
 
Our Biomaterials business operates through our Lifecore subsidiary. Lifecore had revenues of $65 million for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018, $59 million for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2017, and $50 million for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016.
 
Lifecore is involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate in bulk form as well as formulated and filled syringes and vials for injectable products used in treating a broad spectrum of medical conditions and procedures. Lifecore leverages its fermentation process to manufacture premium, pharmaceutical-grade HA and uses its aseptic filling capabilities to deliver private-label HA and non-HA finished products to its customers. There is now a greater percentage of Americans age 65 and older than at any other time in U.S. history and currently over 50 million Americans are 65 years of age or older and this trend is expected to accelerate dramatically in the upcoming years. As our population ages, eye surgeries, such as cataract surgeries, will increase, and other patients will increasingly seek joint therapy as cartilage and soft tissue deteriorates. HA injections are a primary course of treatment for such conditions and Lifecore has built a leadership position in the markets it serves. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2020, 32 million cataract operations will be performed worldwide, up from 12 million in 2000. Lifecore’s expertise includes its ability to ferment, separate, purify, and aseptically formulate and fill HA and other polymers for injectable product use. There are several markets Lifecore serves including ophthalmic, orthopedic, oncology, general surgery, ENT, respiratory and general drug delivery. Lifecore sells its products through partners in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada and South America. Lifecore has built its reputation as a premium supplier of HA and more recently as a specialty CDMO.
 
 -3-


      Lifecore provides product development services to its partners for HA-based, as well as non-HA based, aseptically formulated and filled products. These services include activities such as technology transfer, material component changes, analytical method development, formulation development, pilot studies, stability studies, process validation, and production of materials for clinical studies.
 
By leveraging its fermentation process and aseptic formulation and filling expertise, Lifecore has become a leader in the supply of HA-based products for multiple applications, and has taken advantage of non-HA device and drug opportunities by leveraging its expertise in development, manufacturing and aseptic syringe and vial filling capabilities. Elements of Lifecore’s strategy include the following:
 
•     Establish strategic relationships with market leaders. Lifecore will continue to develop applications for products with partners who have strong marketing, sales and distribution capabilities to end-user markets. Through its strong reputation and history of providing pharmaceutical grade HA products, Lifecore has been able to establish long-term relationships with the market leading pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and leverages those partnerships to attract new relationships in other medical markets.
 
•     Expand medical applications for HA. Due to the growing knowledge of the unique characteristics of HA, and the role it plays in normal physiology, Lifecore continues to identify and pursue opportunities for the use of HA in other medical applications, such as wound care, aesthetic surgery, drug delivery, next generation orthopedics and device coatings and through sales to academic and corporate research customers. Further applications may involve expanding process development activity and/or additional licensing of technology.
 
•     Utilize manufacturing infrastructure to pursue contract aseptic filling and fermentation opportunities. Lifecore has made strategic capital investments in its CDMO business focusing on extending its aseptic filling capacity and capabilities. It is investing in this segment to meet increasing partner demand and attract new contract filling opportunities outside of HA markets. Lifecore is using its manufacturing capabilities to provide contract manufacturing and development services to its partners in the area of sterile pre-filled syringes and vials, as well as, fermentation and purification requirements.
 
•     Maintain flexibility in product development and supply relationships. Lifecore’s vertically integrated development and manufacturing capabilities allow it to establish a variety of contractual relationships with global corporate partners. Lifecore’s role in these relationships extends from supplying HA raw materials to providing technology transfer and development services to manufacturing aseptically filled, finished sterile products and assuming full supply chain responsibilities.
 
C) Other
 
Included in the Other business segment is Corporate and O. The Company acquired O on March 1, 2017. O, founded in 1995, is based in Petaluma, California, and is the premier producer of California specialty olive oils and wine vinegars. Its products are sold in over 4,000 natural food, conventional grocery and mass retail stores, primarily in the United States and Canada. O had revenues of $3.8 million for the twelve months ended May 27, 2018 and $773,000 from the acquisition date through May 28, 2017.
 
Technology Overview
 
The Company has two proprietary polymer technology platforms: (1) Intelimer® materials, which are the key technology behind our BreatheWay membrane technology, and (2) hyaluronan biopolymers. The Company’s materials are generally proprietary as a result of being patented or due to being specially formulated for specific customers to meet specific commercial applications and/or specific regulatory requirements. The Company’s polymer technologies, customer relationships, trade names and strong channels of distribution are the foundation and key differentiating advantages on which Landec has built its business.
A) Intelimer Polymers
 
Intelimer polymers are crystalline, hydrophobic polymers that use a temperature switch to control and modulate properties such as viscosity, permeability and adhesion when varying the materials’ temperature above and below the temperature switch. The sharp temperature switch is adjustable at relatively low temperatures (0°C to 100°C) and the changes resulting from the temperature switch are relatively easy to maintain in industrial and commercial environments. For instance, Intelimer polymers can change within the range of one or two degrees Celsius from a non-adhesive state to a highly tacky, adhesive state; from an impermeable state to a highly permeable state; or from a solid state to a viscous liquid state.
 
 -4-


Landec's proprietary polymer technology is based on the structure and phase behavior of Intelimer materials. The abrupt thermal transitions of specific Intelimer materials are achieved through the controlled use of hydrocarbon side chains that are attached to a polymer backbone. Below a pre-determined switch temperature, the polymer's side chains align through weak hydrophobic interactions resulting in a crystalline structure. When this side chain crystallizable polymer is heated to, or above, this switch temperature, these interactions are disrupted and the polymer is transformed into an amorphous, viscous state. Because this transformation involves a physical and not a chemical change, this process can be repeatedly reversible. Landec can set the polymer switch temperature anywhere between 0°C to 100°C by varying the average length of the side chains.
 
Landec's Intelimer materials are readily available and are generally synthesized from long side-chain acrylic monomers that are derived primarily from natural materials such as coconut and palm oils that are highly purified and designed to be manufactured economically through known synthetic processes. These acrylic-monomer raw materials are then polymerized by Landec leading to many different side-chain crystallizable polymers whose properties vary depending upon the initial materials and the synthetic process. Intelimer materials can be made into many different forms, including films, coatings, microcapsules and discrete forms. Intelimer polymers are the coatings on the substrate used to form our BreatheWay membranes.
 
BreatheWay Membrane Packaging 
 
Certain types of fresh-cut and whole produce can spoil or discolor rapidly when packaged in conventional packaging materials and, therefore, are limited in their ability to be distributed broadly to markets. The Company’s proprietary BreatheWay packaging technology utilizes Landec’s Intelimer polymer technology to naturally extend the shelf-life and quality of fresh-cut and whole produce.
 
After harvesting, vegetables and fruit continue to respire, consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Too much or too little oxygen can result in premature spoilage and decay. The respiration rate of produce varies for each fruit and vegetable. Conventional packaging films used today, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, can be made with modest permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, but often do not provide the optimal atmosphere for the packaged produce. To achieve optimal product performance, each fruit or vegetable requires its own unique package atmosphere conditions. The challenge facing the industry is to develop packaging that meets the highly variable needs that each product requires in order to achieve value-creating performance. The Company believes that its BreatheWay packaging technology possesses all of the critical functionalities required to serve this diverse market. In creating a product package, a BreatheWay membrane is applied over a small cutout section or an aperture of a flexible film bag or plastic tray. This highly permeable “window” acts as the mechanism to provide the majority of the gas transmission requirements for the entire package. These membranes are designed to provide three principal benefits:
 
High Permeability. Landec's BreatheWay packaging technology is designed to permit transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide at 300 to 1,000 times the rate of conventional packaging films. The Company believes that these higher permeability levels will facilitate the packaging diversity required to market many types of fresh-cut and whole produce in many package sizes and configurations.
 
Ability to Adjust Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Ratios. BreatheWay packaging can be tailored with carbon dioxide to oxygen transfer ratios ranging from 1.0 to 12.0 to selectively transmit oxygen and carbon dioxide at optimum rates to sustain the quality and shelf-life of packaged produce. Other high permeability packaging materials, such as micro-perforated films cannot differentially control carbon dioxide permeability, resulting in sub-optimal package atmosphere conditions for many produce products.

Temperature Responsiveness. Landec has developed breathable membranes that can be designed to increase or decrease permeability in response to environmental temperature changes. The Company has developed packaging that responds to higher oxygen requirements at elevated temperatures, but is also reversible, and returns to its original state as temperatures decline. As the respiration rate of fresh produce also increases with temperature, the BreatheWay membrane’s temperature responsiveness allows packages to compensate for the change in produce respiration by automatically adjusting gas permeation rates. By doing so, detrimental package atmosphere conditions are avoided and improved quality is maintained through the distribution chain.
B) Sodium Hyaluronate (HA)
 
Sodium hyaluronate is a non-crystalline, hydrophilic polymer that exists naturally as part of the extracellular matrix in many tissues within the human body, most notably within the aqueous humor of the eye, synovial fluid, skin and umbilical cord. The viscoelastic properties and water solubility of HA make it ideal for medical applications where space maintenance, lubricity, drug delivery or tissue protection are critical. Because of its widespread presence in tissues, its critical role in normal physiology, and its high degree of biocompatibility, the Company believes that hyaluronan will continue to be used in existing applications and for an increasing variety of other medical applications.
 
Sodium hyaluronate can primarily be produced in two ways, either through bacterial fermentation or through extraction from rooster combs. Lifecore produces HA only from fermentation, using an extremely efficient microbial fermentation process and a highly effective purification operation.
 
Sodium hyaluronate was first demonstrated to have commercial medical utility as a viscoelastic solution in cataract surgery. In this application, it is used for maintaining the space in the anterior chamber and protecting corneal tissue during the removal and implantation of intraocular lenses. The first ophthalmic HA product, produced by extraction from rooster comb tissue, became commercially available in the United States in 1981. In 1985, Lifecore introduced the bacterial fermentation process to manufacture premium HA and received patent protection until 2002. HA-based products, produced either by rooster comb extraction or by fermentation processes such as Lifecore’s, have since gained widespread acceptance in ophthalmology and are currently used in the majority of cataract extraction procedures in the world. HA has also become a significant component in several products used in orthopedics. Lifecore’s HA is used as a viscous carrier for allogeneic freeze-dried demineralized bone used in spinal surgery, and as the active component of devices to treat the symptoms of osteoarthritis, and as a component to provide increased lubricity to medical devices. Lifecore’s HA has also been utilized in veterinary drug applications to treat traumatic arthritis.
 
Trademarks and Trade names
 
Intelimer®, Landec®, Apio™, Eat Smart®, BreatheWay®, GreenLine®, Clearly Fresh™, Lifecore®, LUROCOAT®, Ortholure™ and O Olive & Vinegar® are some of the trademarks or registered trademarks and trade names of the Company in the United States and other countries. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also refers to the trademarks of other companies.
Sales and Marketing
 
Apio is supported by dedicated sales and marketing resources. Apio has 46 sales and marketing employees, located in central California and throughout the U.S. and Canada, supporting the Packaged Fresh Vegetables business. During fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, sales to the Company’s top five customers accounted for approximately 49%, 48%, and 50%, respectively, of its revenues. The Company’s top two customers, both from the Packaged Fresh Vegetables segment, were Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”) which accounted for approximately 19%, 20%, and 23%, respectively, and Wal-mart, Inc. (“Wal-mart”) which accounted for approximately 18%, 16%, and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Lifecore sells products to partners under supply agreements and also through distribution agreements. Excluding research sales, Lifecore does not sell to end users and, therefore, does not have the traditional infrastructure of a dedicated sales force and marketing employees. It is Lifecore’s name recognition and referrals that allow Lifecore it to attract new customers and offer its services with a minimal marketing and sales infrastructure.
 
 -6-


Seasonality
 
Apio’s sales are seasonal. The Packaged Fresh Vegetables business can be affected by seasonal weather factors, such as the high cost of sourcing product due to a shortage of essential produce items, which had a significant impact on the Company’s results during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Biomaterials business is not significantly affected by seasonality.
Manufacturing and Processing
 
Packaged Fresh Vegetables Business
 
The manufacturing process for the Company's proprietary BreatheWay packaging products is comprised of polymer manufacturing, membrane manufacturing and label package conversion. A third-party toll manufacturer currently makes virtually all of the polymers for the BreatheWay packaging system. Select outside contractors currently manufacture the breathable membranes, and Apio performs the label package conversion in its various processing facilities.
 
Apio processes its packaged fresh vegetable products in its processing facilities located in Guadalupe, California, Bowling Green, Ohio and Hanover, Pennsylvania. Cooling of produce is done through third parties and its own in-house cooling via its various cooling systems.
 
Apio processes its fresh-cut, packaged green bean products in four processing plants located in Guadalupe, California; Bowling Green, Ohio; Hanover, Pennsylvania; and Vero Beach, Florida.
 
Biomaterials Business
 
The commercial production of HA by Lifecore requires fermentation, separation and purification and aseptic processing capabilities. Products are supplied in a variety of bulk and single dose configurations.
 
Lifecore produces its HA through a bacterial fermentation process. Pharmaceutical grade HA was initially commercially available only through an extraction process from rooster combs. Lifecore believes that the fermentation manufacturing approach is superior to rooster comb extraction because of negativity surrounding animal-sourced materials, greater efficiency and flexibility, a more favorable long-term regulatory environment, and better economies of scale in producing large commercial quantities. Today’s HA competitors are primarily utilizing a fermentation process.
 
Lifecore’s facilities in Chaska, Minnesota are used primarily for the HA manufacturing process, formulation, aseptic syringe and vial filling, analytical services, secondary packaging, warehousing raw materials and finished goods, and distribution. The Company believes that its current manufacturing capacity plan will be sufficient to allow it to meet the needs of its current customers for the foreseeable future.
 
Lifecore provides versatility in the manufacturing of various types of finished products. It supplies several different forms of HA in a variety of molecular weight fractions as powders, solutions and gels, and in a variety of bulk and single-use finished packages. Lifecore continues to conduct development work designed to improve production efficiencies and expand its capabilities to achieve a wider range of HA product specifications in order to address the broadening opportunities for using HA in medical and pharmaceutical applications.
 
The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) inspects the Company’s facilities and manufacturing systems periodically and requires compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and its current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations, as applicable. In addition, Lifecore’s customers conduct intensive quality audits of the facility and its operations. Lifecore also periodically contracts with independent regulatory consultants to conduct audits of its operations.  Similar to other manufacturers subject to regulatory and customer specific requirements, Lifecore’s facility was designed to meet applicable regulatory requirements and has been cleared for the manufacturing of both device and pharmaceutical products. The Company maintains a Quality System which complies with applicable standards and regulations: FDA Medical Device Quality System requirements (21 CFR 820); FDA Drug Good Manufacturing Practices (21 CFR 210-211); European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (EudraLex Volume 4); Medical Device Quality Management System (ISO 13485); European Medical Device Directive; Canadian Medical Device Regulations; International Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (ICH Q7), and Australian Therapeutic Goods Regulations.  Compliance with these international standards of quality greatly assists in the marketing of Lifecore’s products globally.

O Business
 
O uses third parties to crush, process and bottle its olive oil products. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, O moved the fermentation of vinegar in-house upon completing the installation of new vinegar fermentation equipment in its Petaluma facility. The first sales of vinegar produced by O began late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.
 
General
 
Several of the raw materials used in manufacturing certain of the Company’s products are currently purchased from a single source. Although to date the Company has not experienced difficulty acquiring materials for the manufacturing of its products, no assurance can be given that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future, that the Company will be able to obtain substitute vendors, or that the Company will be able to procure comparable materials at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time. Any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to manufacture and distribute its products and, consequently, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.
Research and Development
 
Landec is focusing its research and development resources on both existing and new product applications. Expenditures for research and development for the fiscal years ended May 27, 2018, May 28, 2017, and May 29, 2016 were $12.8 million, $9.5 million, and $7.2 million, respectively. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain its competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. As of May 27, 2018, Landec had 61 employees engaged in research and development with experience in polymer and analytical chemistry, product application, product formulation, and mechanical and chemical engineering.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
The Company's success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. The Company has had 50 U.S. patents issued of which 26 remain active as of May 27, 2018 with expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2031. There can be no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will be approved, that the Company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable, that any patents issued to the Company will provide the Company with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the Company's technology. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of the Company's products or design around the Company's patents. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.
 
The commercial success of the Company will also depend, in part, on its ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If the Company were determined to be infringing any third-party patent, the Company could be required to pay damages, alter its products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. In addition, if patents are issued to others which contain claims that compete or conflict with those of the Company and such competing or conflicting claims are ultimately determined to be valid, the Company may be required to pay damages, to obtain licenses to these patents, to develop or obtain alternative technology or to cease using such technology. If the Company is required to obtain any licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. The Company's failure to obtain a license to any technology that it may require to commercialize its products could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Government regulation in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the marketing of certain of the Company’s products and in the Company’s ongoing research and development activities and contract manufacturing activities. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) the FDA regulates and/or approves the clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, import, export sale and promotion of medical devices and drug products in or from the United States. Some of the Company’s and its customers’ products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, which regulates some of the products as medical devices or drug products, that in some cases require FDA Approval or clearance, prior to U.S. distribution of Pre-Market Approval (“PMAs”), or New Drug Applications (“NDA”), or Pre-Market Notifications (“510(k)”s), or other submissions and by foreign countries, which regulate some of the products as medical devices or drug products.
 
 -8-


Other regulatory requirements are placed on the design, manufacture, processing, packaging, labeling, distribution, recordkeeping and reporting of a medical device or drug products and on the quality control procedures. For example, medical device and drug manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to assure compliance with device QSR and/or drug GMP requirements, as applicable. The FDA also conducts pre-approval inspections for PMA and NDA product introduction. Lifecore’s facility is subject to inspections as both a device and a drug manufacturing operation. For PMA devices and NDA drug products, the company that owns the product submission is required to submit an annual report and also to obtain approval, as applicable, for modifications to the device, drug product or its labeling. Other applicable FDA requirements include but are not limited to reporting requirements such as the medical device reporting (“MDR”) regulation, which requires certain companies to provide information to the FDA regarding deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
 
The Company’s food products and operations are also subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies. Food products are regulated by the FDA under the FDC Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDA has the authority to inspect the Company’s food facilities, and regulates, among other things, food manufacturing (pursuant to food-related cGMPs), food packing and holding, food safety, the growing and harvesting of produce intended for human consumption, food labeling, and food packaging. The FDA is currently implementing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act and has published a number of final rules related to, among other things, hazard analysis and preventive controls, produce safety, foreign supplier verification programs, sanitary transportation of food, and food defense. The compliance dates for these rules vary and started as early as September, 2016. The FDA also requires companies to report to the FDA via the Reportable Food Registry when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other state authorities regulate how the Company may promote and advertise its food products.
 
Employees
 
As of May 27, 2018, Landec had 710 full-time employees, of whom 568 were dedicated to research, development, manufacturing, quality control and regulatory affairs, and 142 were dedicated to sales, marketing and administrative activities. Landec intends to recruit additional personnel in connection with the development, manufacturing and marketing of its products. None of Landec's employees are represented by a union, and Landec considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
