-----------------------------------+---------

GENERAL AND HISTORICAL
 
Company Overview
 
Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Ohr,” or the “Company”) is a pharmaceutical company which has been focused on the development of novel therapeutics and delivery technologies for the treatment of ocular disease.
Recent Developments
 
On January 2, 2019, the Company, Ohr Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ohr (“Merger Sub”), and NeuBase Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuBase”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NeuBase, with NeuBase becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation of the merger (the “Merger”). The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (a) each outstanding share of NeuBase common stock, including shares of NeuBase capital stock issued in, or issued upon conversion, exercise or exchange of securities issued in, the NeuBase Financing (as defined below), will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Company Common Stock”) equal to the exchange ratio described below; (b) each outstanding NeuBase stock option that has not previously been exercised prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by the Company; and (c) the warrant to purchase shares of common stock of NeuBase will be converted into and become a warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock.
 Under the exchange ratio formula in the Merger Agreement, as of immediately after the Merger, the former NeuBase securityholders are expected to own approximately 80% (the “NeuBase Allocation Percentage”) of the aggregate number of shares of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding following the consummation of the Merger (the “Post-Closing Shares”), and the stockholders of the Company as of immediately prior to the Merger are expected to own approximately 20% (the “Ohr Allocation Percentage”) of the aggregate number of Post-Closing Shares. NeuBase anticipates that it will issue and sell not less than $4,000,000 (the gross proceeds received by NeuBase, the “NeuBase Proceeds”) of its equity securities (including securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into such equity securities) prior to the Effective Time (the “NeuBase Financing”). The NeuBase Allocation Percentage will be increased by 0.1% for every $100,000 that the NeuBase Proceeds exceeds $4,000,000, and the Ohr Allocation Percentage will be decreased by 0.1% for every $100,000 that the NeuBase Proceeds exceeds $4,000,000.
 Immediately following the Effective Time, the name of the Company will be changed from “Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc.” to “NeuBase Therapeutics, Inc.” The Merger Agreement contemplates that, immediately after the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company will consist of five members, all of which will be designated by NeuBase. The executive officers of the Company immediately after the Effective Time will be designated by NeuBase with NeuBase’s Chief Executive Officer, Dietrich Stephan, being the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company and NeuBase, including covenants relating to obtaining the requisite approvals of the stockholders of the Company and NeuBase, indemnification of directors and officers, and the Company and NeuBase signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of the Company and NeuBase. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and NeuBase, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay NeuBase a termination fee of $250,000 or NeuBase may be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $250,000.
 In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) the officers and directors of the Company have each entered into a support agreement with the Company and NeuBase (the “Ohr Support Agreements”), and (ii) the officers, directors and certain affiliated stockholders of NeuBase have each entered into a support agreement with NeuBase and the Company (the “NeuBase Support Agreements,” together with the Ohr Support Agreements, the “Support Agreements”). The Support Agreements place certain restrictions on the transfer of the shares of the Company and NeuBase held by the respective signatories thereto and include covenants as to the voting of such shares in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against any actions that could adversely affect the consummation of the Merger.
 Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the officers and directors of the Company, and the officers, directors and certain stockholders of NeuBase, each entered into lock-up agreements (the “Lock-Up Agreements”) pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, not to sell or dispose of any shares of Company Common Stock which are or will be beneficially owned by them at the closing of the Merger until the date that is 90 days after the Effective Time.
 In connection with the Merger, on January 2, 2019, Ohr entered into a Retention Bonus Agreement with Dr. Jason Slakter, Ohr’s Chief Executive Officer (the “Retention Bonus Agreement”). Under the Retention Bonus Agreement, Dr. Slakter is eligible for a retention bonus payment of $75,000 upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) Dr. Slakter’s continued service with the Company in his current position through and including the closing date of the Merger, or (ii) Dr. Slakter is involuntarily separated from service without Cause (as such term is defined in the Retention Bonus Agreement) by the Company prior to the closing date of the Merger. In the event Dr. Slakter voluntarily separates from service with the Company for any reason prior to the closing of the Merger, Dr. Slakter will not receive any retention bonus payment and the Company will have no further obligation to Dr. Slakter under the Retention Bonus Agreement.
 
Corporate and Historical Information
 
We are a Delaware corporation that was organized on August 4, 2009, as successor to BBM Holdings, Inc. (formerly Prime Resource, Inc., which was organized March 29, 2002 as a Utah corporation) pursuant to a reincorporation merger. On August 4, 2009, we reincorporated in Delaware as Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc.
 
On May 30, 2014, we completed the ophthalmology assets acquisition (the “SKS Acquisition”) of the privately held SKS Ocular LLC and its affiliate, SKS Ocular 1 LLC (“SKS”). Simultaneous with the SKS Acquisition, Ohr completed a holding company reorganization in which Ohr merged with a wholly owned subsidiary and a new parent corporation succeeded Ohr as a public holding company under the same name. The business operations of Ohr did not change as a result of the reorganization. The new holding company retained the name “Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc.” Outstanding shares of the capital stock of the former Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. were automatically converted, on a share for share basis, into identical shares of common stock of the new holding company.
 
On January 5, 2018, the Company reported topline data from the MAKO study which did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. The MAKO study evaluated the efficacy and safety of topically administered squalamine in combination with monthly Lucentis® injections for the treatment of wet-AMD. Based on these results, we discontinued further development of squalamine and have been evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value.
 
As part of its review of strategic alternatives, the Company formed a special committee of independent directors. The Board of Directors and the special committee have engaged Roth Capital Markets, LLC, to advise them and management, and to assist in pursuing a range of strategic alternatives including some of the following: license, divestiture, or other monetization of current assets; license or acquisition of additional assets; merger, reverse merger, joint venture, partnership, or other business combination with another entity, public or private. Neither the Board nor the special committee has set a definitive timetable for completion of this process. There can be no assurance that this process will result in a strategic alternative of any kind. The Company does not intend to disclose developments or provide updates on the progress or status of this process unless it deems further disclosure is appropriate or required.

ASSETS AND TECHNOLOGIES
 

(a) | SKS SUSTAINED RELEASE OCULAR DRUG DELIVERY PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The SKS sustained release technology was designed to develop best-in-class drug formulations for ocular disease. The technology employs micro fabrication techniques to create nano, micro and macroparticle drug formulations that can provide sustained and predictable release of a therapeutic drug over a 3-6 month period. The versatility of this delivery technology makes it well suited to potentially deliver hydrophilic or hydrophobic small molecules, as well as proteins with complex structures.
 
In February 2017, the Company suspended activities at its lab facility in San Diego, CA where research regarding the SKS sustained release technology had been conducted. However, the Company continues to explore strategies and pathways for applications of its sustained release technology and potential avenues to monetize it.
 

(b) | CEP ASSETS 
----+----------------------------------------------------

 
As part of the SKS acquisition, we acquired the exclusive rights to an animal model for dry-AMD whereby mice are immunized with a carboxyethylpyrrole (“CEP”) which is bound to mouse serum albumin (“MSA”) as well as the rights to produce and use CEP for research, clinical, and commercial applications. CEP is produced following the oxidation of docosahexaenoic acid, which is abundant in the photoreceptor outer segments that are phagocytosed by the retinal pigment epithelium (“RPE”). A number of CEP-adducted proteins have been identified in proteomic studies examining the composition of drusen and other subretinal deposits found in the eyes of patients with dry-AMD. Studies have shown that immunization of CEP-MSA can lead to an ophthalmic phenotype very similar to dry-AMD, including deposition of complement in the RPE, thickening of the Bruch’s membrane, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, and immune cell influx into the eye. Upon immunization with CEP, a marked decrease in contrast sensitivity which precedes a loss of visual acuity, was observed, similar to what occurs in many patients with dry AMD. The Company has not yet monetized this technology.
 

(c) | DEPYMED JOINT VENTURE 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ohr also owns various other compounds in earlier stages of development, including the PTP1b inhibitor trodusquemine and related analogs. On February 26, 2014, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement and related agreements with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (“CSHL”) pursuant to which a joint venture, DepYmed Inc. (“DepYmed”), was formed to further preclinical and clinical development of Ohr’s trodusquemine and analogues as PTP1B inhibitors for oncology and rare disease indications. DepYmed licenses research from CSHL and intellectual property from us. Ohr is a passive joint venturer in DepYmed.
 
Competitive Factors
 
Competition in General
 
Competition in the area of biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development is intense and significantly depends on scientific and technological factors. These factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We can provide no assurance that developments by others will not render our technology obsolete, noncompetitive or harm our strategy, that we will be able to keep pace with new technological developments or that our technology will be able to supplant established products and methodologies in the therapeutic areas that are targeted by us. The foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.
Competitive Landscape in Sustained Release Drug Delivery
 
There are a number of companies developing various forms of sustained release drug delivery platforms for ophthalmic applications. These include, but are not limited to:
 

● | GreyBug with a biodegradable polymer microsphere/nanoparticle matrix system; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aerie Pharmaceuticals with the PRINT® technology system for microparticle and nanoparticle formulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Kala Pharmaceuticals with a mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) technology; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ocular Therapeutix with a proprietary hydrogel technology. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of these programs are in a more advanced stage than us. Each of these may prove to be effective means to deliver drugs in a sustained manner and we cannot assure that none of them will get to market before us or that our technology will be a better drug delivery approach.

Corporate Strategy
 
The Board of Directors and the special committee have engaged Roth Capital Markets, LLC, to advise them and management, and to assist in pursuing a range of strategic alternatives including some of the following: license, divestiture, or other monetization of current assets; license or acquisition of additional assets; merger, reverse merger, joint venture, partnership, or other business combination with another entity, public or private. Neither the Board nor the special committee has set a definitive timetable for completion of this process. There can be no assurance that this process will result in a strategic alternative of any kind. The Company does not intend to disclose developments or provide updates on the progress or status of this process unless it deems further disclosure is appropriate or required.
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
 
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our assets, and also to rely upon trade secrets, know-how and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
We generally seek worldwide patent protection for products and have foreign patent rights corresponding to most of our U.S. patents. We currently own or have exclusively licensed several issued U.S. patents and non-US patents and have additional U.S. and non-U.S. pending patent applications.
 
Under an agreement with Akina, Inc (“Akina”), we license patents and patent applications, with an estimated expiration date of September 2031, relating to nano/micro/macro particle fabrication technology for sustained release of molecules. The worldwide, exclusive, sub-licensable license was granted to SKS (now Ohr) for use in developing ocular products. Under the agreement with Akina, the parties collaborated on three nano/micro particle products. Additional patent applications have been filed that expand on this platform technology.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the term of a U.S. patent is 20 years and is measured from the effective date that the patent application was filed rather than the prior calculation of term which was 17 years from the date that the patent issued. Patent term may be extended beyond the 20-year period by patent term adjustment when the U.S. Patent Office fails to examine the patent application in a timely manner before issuance of the patent. We take advantage of patent term adjustment whenever available and expect to seek patent term extensions following marketing approval. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988 (the “GADPTR Act”), a patent that claims a product, use or method of manufacture covering a drug may be extended for up to five years to compensate the patent holder for a portion of the time required for FDA review. Our issued U.S. patents and applications related to the SKS technology have expiration dates ranging from April 2027 to September 2033.
 
While we file and prosecute patent applications to protect our inventions, our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of patents or our issued patents might not provide competitive advantages. Also, our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology.
 
In addition to seeking intellectual property protection via patents and licenses, we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and technological innovation, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, suppliers and licensees.
 
The scope, enforceability and effective term of issued patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims in pharmaceutical patents, so that even issued patents might later be modified or revoked by the relevant patent authorities or courts. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with a similar claim scope in another country, and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries, so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country. The patents we obtain and the unpatented proprietary technology we hold might not afford us significant commercial protection. Additional information regarding risks associated with our patents and other proprietary rights that affect our business is contained under the heading “Intellectual property litigation is increasingly common and increasingly expensive and may result in restrictions on our business and substantial costs, even if we prevail” and under the heading “Risk Factors”.
 
There are no contested proceedings and/or third-party claims over any of our patents or patent applications.
 
NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED
 
At September 30, 2018, we had three full-time employees. In addition, we use consultants on an as needed basis, to provide a cost efficient alternative to a larger infrastructure to support the Company.
GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE
 
The Drug Development Process
 
Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of product candidates. Any product candidates will require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other premarket approval requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted.
 
The activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In Phase 1, trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as required by the FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a therapeutic product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application.


4


Any approval required by the FDA for any product candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or efficacy of compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in humans.
 
Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required for FDA approval.
 
Other Regulations
 
Various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the environment and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with research activities. They include, among others, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, import, export, and customs regulations, and other present and possible future local, state, or federal regulation. The compliance with these and other laws, regulations and recommendations can be time consuming and involve substantial costs. In addition, the extent of governmental regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
