Recent Developments
 
cbdMD’s products were again recognized and awarded 2022 Product of the Year Awards by a national survey organized by Kantar, a global leader in research. cbdMD serves as the first CBD company to win Product of the Year in consecutive years, earning 2022 top honors in “CBD Ingestible” for its CBD Drink Mixes. cbdMD was also named as the Sleeping Beauty Award at the 2022 Daytime Beauty Awards for its sleep focused product.  This fall our gummies were named Editors Picked by Healthline, a leading online provider of health information.
 
Our Paw brand won two Pet Innovations awards this year from Independent Innovations Awards, an independent awards association.  Our cat soft chews won the Cat Product of the year while our dog calming tinctures won the Dog Product of the Year.
 
Management ﻿continues to be very focused on delivering positive earnings through a combination of optimizing our product portfolio, right-sizing our cost structure and investing in marketing that will provide positive return on customer acquisition.
 
During fiscal 2022 we rationalized a significant portion of our product portfolio all while repositioning our product set for higher efficacy and functional products.  We continued to expand on our full spectrum products, launched a Delta 9 and pioneered commercializing NSF (a global health and safety organization) and NSF for Sport SKUs.  More recently we launched our strongest CBD, best pricing, as well as our cbdMD Max, formulated to have clinically proven claims around pain and discomfort.
 
Growth Strategies
 
We continued to pursue many strategies to grow our revenues and expand the scope of our business in fiscal 2022 and beyond:
 

● | Product Innovation: Our goal is to provide our customers superior functional based products with greater efficacy, absorption and efficacy claims. We regularly assess and evaluate our product portfolio, and devote resources to ongoing research and development processes with the goal of improving our product offerings to meet consumer demands. During fiscal 2022 we significantly rationalized our SKU offering to focus on our highest and best sellers. During this year we launched an industry first NSF for Sport product line, a line of Delta 9 gummies and microdose products, a number of functional gummies and capsules. Based on customer feedback and preliminary clinicals we launched a new line of high-strength CBD products at the end of September. We have a robust pipeline of products to launch during fiscal 2023, including our new clinically proven product cbdMD Max for Pain.

● | Expand our revenue channels: During fiscal 2022, our wholesale business continued to face macro industry contraction trends that we believe are tied to low-dose, high-priced products. We continued to pursue relationships with traditional retail accounts and believe our top brand awareness and effective marketing position us as a preferred CBD partner for key traditional retail accounts as this channel has continued to normalize. During the second quarter we added several top selling ingestible SKUs throughout GNC’s retail footprint. We believe it is important to have the right product at the right price for the right channel and worked on a bespoke line of products for the food drug and mass channel (“FDM”) that shipped to Wegmans in late fiscal 2022. In September we adjusted our wholesale offer to align with our strongest CBD, best prices consumer offer. We continue to have discussions with key retailers and have expanded our sales organization to include deep channel-specific experience, focused on developing a pipeline of opportunities we believe are strategic to the category and our brand. 
● | International Expansion: We continue to explore sales in markets outside of the United States. Our products are currently available in 31 countries. We generally partner with local wholesalers and local legal counsel who can help navigate the laws and regulatory requirements within their jurisdiction. We continue to pursue key wholesale accounts in a number of international markets and are gaining market share in Central America through our sanitary registration approvals. We are also expanding our E-commerce business to consumers in the United Kingdom (U.K.). In March 2021, we officially filed our Novel Food Application with the United Kingdom’s Food Standards Agency (“FSA”) and the European Union’s (“EU”) Food Safety Agency (“EFSA”). In March 2022, we received notice that the products we submitted have been validated in the UK as well as in the EU. based warehouse. During August 2021 we signed an exclusive agreement to enter the Israeli Market with IM Cannabis Corp. a multi-country operator in the medical and adult- use recreational cannabis sector with operations in Israel, Germany and Canada. In March 2022, the Israeli Health Ministry announced it has begun the process of exempting CBD from its banned substances list and will be permitting CBD to be included into food and cosmetic products. During fiscal 2022, we registered and began selling products in Japan.

● | Cultivate Additional Brands: During fiscal 2022 we took additional steps to grow the Paw CBD business which include advertising on TV, introducing our Paw CBD rewards program and introducing a Paw CBD subscription program which offers additional savings to customers enrolled in the service. During 2022 we launched cbdMD Botanicals as a separate brand and continue to build out the product portfolio and distribution channels. We believe there is ongoing opportunities with these to focus on education, cross-selling and customer retention.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Acquisitions: We evaluate acquisitions where we believe (i) there is an accretive customer base that can lower our cost of customer acquisitions through either a complementary direct to consumer base or wholesale channels, or (ii) the target has a profitable business or easily attainable cost synergies that can quickly help contribute and accelerate profitability of our Company. 

Marketing
 
Our business model is designed first and foremost to build a strong brand as quickly as possible as we operate in an emerging CBD market. As CBD is a relatively new market, we believe the cost to acquire customers is most likely at the lowest point it will be, therefore, as part of our overall strategy we started with an internet and online marketing strategy and have invested heavily in brand promotion and customer acquisition. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 we spent approximately $15,363,751 and $17,902,673, respectively, on brand development, sponsorships and marketing.
 
Our marketing department services multiple brands, including cbdMD, Paw CBD, and cbdMD Botanicals. We employ a multi-channel media approach that allows us to market our brand and products through various distribution efforts, which includes sports and athletes sponsorships, professional partnerships, social media engagement, podcasts, digital and television advertising, affiliate marketing, and influencer endorsements. We also have media partnerships in place with the Joe Rogan Experience, Spotify and Draft Kings and working to expand these partnerships where we believe the customer acquisition costs and brand exposure meet our thresholds.
 
Based on the latest report from Brightfield Group, cbdMD holds the #3 position in Online Brand Share and grew 5 percentage points (8% to 13%) in repeat purchasers during the last 3-6 months during the quarter ending September 2022, which aligns with our launch of our higher strength product range and evolved subscription model. Additionally, cbdMD ranks 1st in anxiety relief among CBD industry purchasers, highlighting the success of our benefit focused products and messaging.
 
During Fiscal 2022 we reviewed our customer analytics to better understand customer habits and attribution and identify opportunities to lower our cost of customer acquisition and improve lifetime value.  As such we have rationalized a significant amount of marketing spend throughout the year eliminating expensive sponsorships, influencers and digital spend where we could not derive strong attribution or generate sufficient brand exposure.  Our goal is to continue to thoughtfully invest in expanding our already highly recognizable brand and place increased emphasis on consumer, retailer and regulatory education. Through these educational efforts we expect to attract more consumers to the category as well as enlighten more retailers to the opportunity and gain more widespread regulatory acceptance.
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we have shifted our strategy to focus to our higher-strength CBD product range to deliver optimal wellness benefits at a price-point that is accessible to everyone and well below the top brands in the category.  Our objective is is to be the leader in the cannabinoid category by leveraging our higher strength products, safe and clinically supported claims, and best customer customer experience to attract and retain consumers.

Sales
 
We distribute our products both through our online sales channel as well as through a number of wholesalers and retailers that resell our products both in brick and mortar locations as well as via their online websites. Sales of our products primarily come from online sales at our websites www.cbdmd.com, www.pawcbd.com, cbdmdbotanicals.com and www.directcbdonline.com and through our inside sales department. Our inside sales team concentrates on B2B niche specialty retailers as well as wholesale distributors, who we believe can help amplify our reach of cbdMD products at physical retail locations.
 
During fiscal 2022, our e-commerce business experienced continued growth, with year over year increases in new e-commerce customers. For fiscal 2022, approximately 75% of sales were e-commerce as compared to approximately 74% in 2021. The number of stores we serve on our B2B brick and mortar side of our business grew to approximately 3,366 locations during fiscal 2022 as we saw COVID-19 related restrictions continue to be lifted and B2B brick and mortar distribution channels continue to bounce back. In addition, we acquired www.directcbdonline.com during 2021. The acquisition of www.directcbdonline.com, which has allowed us to own a CBD online marketplace that sells various CBD brands, provides a unique transparency to better understand consumer spending habits and trends across the wider CBD and hemp marketplace, as well as enhances our overall direct to consumer capabilities.
 
Product manufacturing
 
We are committed to producing a safe, high-quality product with testing transparency. We only use cannabinoids extracted from hemp grown in the United States in our products. All suppliers meet strict quality requirements and are validated producers of hemp under state and federal laws.
 
During 2022 the Company completed the sale of its manufacturing assets to Steady State, LLC, significantly reducing its fixed overhead costs, migrating to a more variable cost structure, as now all production is outsourced. 
 
We develop detailed product specifications and utilize several manufacturers with specific formulation and format expertise to deliver finished products within specification. These suppliers, who have undergone a detailed supplier verification process, are independently cGMP certified, and are subject to continuing independent audit and certifications. Master Manufacturing Agreements and Quality Assurance Agreements are required for all of our critical supply contract manufacturers. All finished goods are tested by the supplier at an independent ISO accredited third-party laboratory to ensure they meet ingredient label claims, including purity and strength of cannabinoid levels and comply with the THC content requirements in the 2018 Farm Act, before they are released for shipment. We have no long term obligations with any manufacturers or suppliers.
 
As a consumer goods brand dedicated to providing the highest quality hemp extracted cannabinoid consumer products on the market, we strive to meet or exceed the FDAs Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. These guidelines provide a system of processes procedures and documentation to assure a product is manufactured consistently, in a safe manner, and meets label claims for identity, strength, composition, quality, and purity. Our warehouse operations encompassing 80,000 square feet, is fully GMP compliant and NSF dietary supplements certified. Quality of products is a key tenant of our operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we renewed our NSF GMP 455 certification.  We also hold the National Animal Supplement Counsel’s (“NASC”) prestigious Quality Seal Award.  In addition, during fiscal 2022 we were the first CBD company to commercialize THC Free SKUs that were NSF Certified Products, which is a prestigious third-party guarantee that ensures what we say is in the product is actually in the product. We also spearheaded NSF’s Certified for Sport (CFS) for cannabinoid products and were the first company to commercialize products under this rigorous program that gives assurances that a person consuming an NSF CFS product will not fail a World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) test for banned substances, thus assuring our customers they can safely consume our CFS products.

Research and development and product enhancements
 
Our new product development efforts are focused on both near-term and long-term results for the Company. The key objectives and input points driving cbdMD’s research and development process include current product improvement efforts and new product development activities. Our product improvement efforts include consumer feedback analysis and feedback from panels of product testers, among others. We have expanded our consumer feedback analysis to include biometric device monitoring and expect statistically relevant data to be generated as early as the second quarter of 2023. We also conduct in-depth market research campaigns and sample size testing and research. Our new product development activities include market research, projecting future product trends, research and identification of clinically proven, proprietary functional ingredients, and research to develop new product offerings, manufacturing process optimization, in-depth product testing, and package and graphic development. The Company is exploring exclusive partnerships with well-known and established dietary supplement ingredient manufacturers to include their proprietary and clinically studied ingredients in functional combination products to address specific consumer needs in large market segments. The first such partnership was entered into with Unigen Corporation to include their proprietary pain reduction ingredient Univestin in a first of its kind CBD product to address the +$30 Billion market for pain management drugs. To further guide product refinement and new product development, cbdMD Therapeutics successfully completed two clinical studies, one in humans and one in dogs.
 
In August of 2022 the Company concluded a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical study in dogs performed in conjunction with Colorado’s State University’s veterinary program. Preliminary results indicate that our proprietary broad spectrum hemp extract improved mobility, gait, and quality of life in dogs with osteoarthritis. These results are expected to provide claims related to our proprietary broad spectrum blend’s efficacy and drive new product development to address the needs of the nearly $2 Billion canine arthritis treatment market according to Expert Market Research.
 
In September of 2022 the Company concluded a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical study in healthy adults utilizing its proprietary hemp extract blend which demonstrated significant benefits in many areas, including reduction of pain, reduced inflammation, improvements to several immunity markets, and improved mood, and these results are further driving the refinement of current products and the development of new products which utilize the same proprietary blend of hemp extracted cannabinoids.
 
The results from both of the clinical studies will inform near term product development and marketing efforts, and serve as preliminary data for future clinical studies.
 
The formation of Therapeutics has also led to the identification of a novel cannabinoid that will be patented and utilized in future formulations for cbdMD. We believe the Company’s investments into therapeutics R&D will continue to benefit current products and dietary supplement development.
 
Intellectual property 
 
We hold a portfolio of U.S. trademark applications which are held for current and future product offerings and extended branding capability. The portfolio includes but is not limited to trademarks set forth below:
 


Mark | Federal registration No. | Filing date | Description of Mark Usage 
------------------+--------------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------
DIRECT CBD ONLINE | 6324509 | 5/10/2019 | Service mark 
DIRECT CBD ONLINE | 6399287 | 5/10/2019 | Service mark 
cbdMD | 88451429 | 5/29/2019 | Stylized word mark (logo in color)

We currently have filed multiple foreign trademark applications for CBDMD and PAWCBD and have secured marks in the following countries: Chile, Costa Rica, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, European Union, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Columbia, Australia, and Switzerland. We continue to prosecute the CBDMD and PAWCBD trademarks in the following countries: Brazil, Canada, China, Spain, Mexico, Norway, and South Africa. Additionally, a growing number of our products hold sanitary registrations in certain Central and South American countries.
 
In July 2020, we filed a new patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which will allow us to pursue patented protection in several key areas, including novel formulations and delivery systems, as well as methods of manufacturing and use. This application is currently under examination.
 
In addition to our trademarks and our patent filing, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our product development, formulation and knowhow, as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our formulas and other proprietary information.
 
In addition to www.cbdmd.com, www.pawcbdmd.com, www.cbdmdbotanicals.com and www.directcbdonline.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registers or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.
 
Competition
 
The CBD-based market has remained fragmented with over 2,000 brands in the category with no clear dominant brand in the US. According to Brightfield Group (2022 Mid-Year US CBD Report), cbdMD ranked 3rd in Online Brand Share and 5th in Revenue within the CBD industry for 2022. The top 20 Brands Market share shrank slightly during Q1 2022 from 18.9% to 18.4%, due to category supply chain issues and slowing consolidation post COVID-19.  Our competitors of CBD and cannabinoid-based products include a combination of public and private companies who operate as combination of e-commerce and wholesale brands as well as brick and mortar retail operations.

Government Regulations 
 
On December 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed the Farm Bill into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and hemp products containing less than 0.3 percent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, including removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substance Act. On January 15, 2021 the USDA issued its final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which authorized hemp to be grown and processed legally in the United States and made it legal to transport hemp and its derivatives in interstate commerce.
 
The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We actively monitor the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.
 
In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD will guide the industry. The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill.
 
As of the date of this report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD. In December 2020, the FTC announced it was going to seek penalties against companies making deceptive marketing claims and named 6 companies which it had targeted for making egregious and unsupported health claims. On March 5, 2021, the FTC approved the final administrative consent orders with all 6 companies. We are unaware of any further actions and we will continue to monitor the FTC’s position with regards to deceptive marketing claims.
 
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
 
There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
 
On March 26, 2021, we submitted a Novel Foods dossier with both the EU Food Safety Agency (FSA) and the United Kingdom’s Food Safety Agency (UK FSA). “Novel Foods” are foods which have not been widely consumed in the UK or the EU before May 1997. In December 2020 the EU FSA announced it would begin accepting Novel Food dossiers for CBD after suspending acceptance for most of the year. This change was due to an EU Court of Justice opinion ruling that certain hemp derived extracts should not be classified as narcotic controlled substances. Before a Novel Food can be marketed in the UK or EU, it is required to have a pre-market safety assessment and authorization. The UK has waived the pre-market requirement and is allowing post market submissions for products that were in the marketplace prior to February 2020, which qualifies our products. We worked in conjunction with a leading food safety and regulatory consultant in the UK to prepare the dossiers which included detailed analysis of the quality and stability of our products, our hemp sourcing and extraction controls, our labeling and testing requirements, and the underlying intake and toxicological data related to the safe consumption of the proprietary cannabinoid blend ingredients in our cbdMD product line. Since April 26, 2021, the UK Government has yet to provide the industry any material public feedback or clarity on industry wide submissions. The Company strongly believes its products will ultimately be approved once the administration delays in the UK are cleared.
 
As of this filing, the Company is in the Risk Assessment stage of the Novel Food approval process in both the UK and EU. The Company is one of only a handful of companies which have been validated and entered the Risk Assessment phase in the UK, and we believe we are the only company to be Validated and be moved into Risk Assessment analysis in the EU. The Company is currently actively selling its products in the UK.
 
Human Capital
 
At December 1, 2022 we had approximately 90 full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.
 
We believe that cbdMD’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We believe that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
