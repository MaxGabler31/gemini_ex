ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Aytu BioPharma, Inc. (“Aytu,” the “Company”, “we”) is a pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing novel therapeutics and consumer healthcare products and developing therapeutics for rare pediatric-onset or difficult-to-treat diseases. We have two primary product candidates in development, AR101 enzastaurin for the treatment of VEDS and Healight (endotracheal light catheter) for the treatment the treatment of severe, difficult-to-treat respiratory infections. We were incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August 9, 2002 in the State of Colorado and were re-incorporated as Aytu BioScience, Inc in the state of Delaware on June 8, 2015. Following the acquisition of Neos Therapeutics, Inc. (“Neos”) in March 2021 (“Neos Acquisition”), we changed our name to Aytu BioPharma, Inc.
RECENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Commercial Products 
On March 23, 2022, our newly issued US patent No. 11,166,947 for Cotempla XR-ODT was listed in the FDA publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," commonly known as the "Orange Book." The Cotempla XR-ODT patent covers methods of use for the effective pediatric dosing of methylphenidate for the treatment ADHD. The Orange Book listing extends the exclusivity period for Cotempla XR-ODT to 2038. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. has the right to manufacture and market its generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT under its Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) beginning on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances.
As part of our realization of post-Neos acquisition synergies and product prioritization, we implemented a portfolio rationalization plan whereby we discontinued or divested five non-core products: Cefaclor Oral Suspension, Flexichamber, Tussionex, Tuzistra XR, and ZolpiMist. These products, collectively, contributed $2.2 million in net revenue and $0.7 million in gross loss during the year ended June 30, 2022.

AR101
On December 7, 2021, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation (“ODD”) to AR101(“enzastaurin”) for the treatment of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a group of rare inherited connective tissue disorders that includes the severe subtype VEDS. The FDA grants ODD status to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases, or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. ODD affords us with certain financial incentives to support clinical development and the potential for seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. upon regulatory approval.
On December 13, 2021, the FDA cleared the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for AR101 in VEDS to enable the initiation of the AR101 PREVEnt Trial in VEDS. We are underway with preparation activities for our PREVEnt Trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating once daily enzastaurin in the treatment of VEDS. The PREVEnt Trial is designed to enroll approximately 260 patients with COL3A1-positive VEDS in order to assess time to arterial events leading to intervention among patients treated with AR101 compared to patients treated with standard-of-care. The trial is expected to begin enrolling patients by early 2023.
On March 2, 2022, the European Commission granted orphan designation to AR101 for the treatment of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. To qualify in Europe for orphan drug designation, an investigational medicine must be intended to treat a seriously debilitating or life-threatening condition that affects fewer than five in 10,000 people in the European Union (‘EU”), and there must be sufficient non-clinical or clinical data to suggest the investigational medicine may 

7



produce clinically relevant outcomes. The European Medicines Agency orphan designation affords us with certain benefits and incentives, including clinical protocol assistance, differentiated evaluation procedures for Health Technology Assessments in certain countries, access to a centralized marketing authorization procedure valid in all EU member states, reduced regulatory fees and 10 years of market exclusivity.
On April 19, 2022, we were notified by the FDA that AR101 received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”). Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track addresses a broad range of serious conditions, and the request can be initiated by a pharmaceutical company at any time during the development process. The FDA reviews the request and decides based on whether or not the drug fills an unmet medical need in a serious condition. Once a drug receives Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and the sponsor is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process.
Healight
In November 2021, we received U.S. Patent Number 11,179,575, titled "Internal Ultraviolet Therapy," which is the first issued patent protecting the Healight investigational device and covers methods of treating a patient for an infectious condition inside the patient's body through the insertion of a UV-light-emitting delivery tube inside a respiratory cavity of the patient at specific UV-A light wavelengths. The term of this patent extends to August of 2040.
In April 2022, our preclinical pilot study showed that administration of Healight delayed the time to development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (“VAP”) in a novel porcine model. The proof-of-concept study was conducted at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona under the supervision of principal investigator Antonio Torres, M.D., Ph.D., FERS, FCCP, ATSF, Senior Consultant, Pulmonology Department - one of the only centers in the world with access to this well-characterized porcine model of VAP caused by oropharyngeal secretions colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the study, administration of the Healight UV-A endotracheal catheter resulted in a 46% reduction in multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA C1-17) versus controls following two separate 20-minute treatments. Based on these positive data, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and we have initiated a second, larger porcine VAP study to guide the future development of Healight for patients with VAP.
Debt and Equity financing 
On January 26, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Avenue Capital Agreement”) with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P. and Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P. as lenders (the “Avenue Capital Lenders”), and Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. as administrative agent (the “Avenue Capital Agent”), collectively (“Avenue Capital”), pursuant to which the Avenue Capital Lenders provided the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with a secured $15.0 million loan. The interest rate on the loan is the greater of the prime rate and 3.25%, plus 7.4%, payable monthly in arrears. The maturity date of the loan is January 26, 2025. The proceeds from the Avenue Capital Agreement were used towards the repayment of the Deerfield Facility, which was otherwise due and payable on May 11, 2022.
In connection with the Avenue Capital Agreement, we entered into a Consent, Waiver and Second Amendment to Eclipse Loan Agreement with Eclipse Business Capital LLC (f/k/a Encina Business Credit, LLC) (“Eclipse”), dated as of January 26, 2022 (the “Eclipse Loan Agreement”). Pursuant to the Eclipse Loan Agreement, the Company, among other things, extended the maturity date of the Eclipse Loan Agreement to January 26, 2025 and reduced the maximum availability under the Eclipse Loan Agreement from $25.0 million to $12.5 million minus a $3.5 million availability block,
In March 2022, upon closing of an underwritten public offering, we raised gross proceeds of $7.6 million from the issuance of (i) 3,030,000 shares of our common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 3,030,000 shares of our common stock, and (iii) common stock purchase warrants (the “Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 6,666,000 shares of our common stock (the “March 2022 Offering”). We received $6.8 million in proceeds net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In April 2022, the pre-funded warrants were exercised in full.

In August 2022, upon the closing of an underwritten public offering, we raised gross proceeds of $10.0 million from the issuance of (i) 21,505,814 shares of our common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,750,000 shares of its common stock, and (ii) accompanying warrants (the "Common Warrants") to purchase 23,255,814 shares of our common stock (the "Offering"). We received $9.1 million in proceeds net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In August, the pre-funded warrants were exercised in full.
COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We operate through two business segments (i) the BioPharma segment, consisting of various prescription pharmaceutical products sold through third parties the BioPharma segment, and (ii) the Consumer Health segment, which consists of various consumer health products sold directly to consumers. We generate revenue by selling our products through third party intermediaries in our marketing channels as well as directly to our customers. We currently manufacture our products for the treatment of ADHD at our manufacturing facilities and use third party manufacturers for our other prescription and consumer health products.
BioPharma Segment
Our BioPharma Segment consists of our ADHD Product and Pediatric Product portfolios. Our prescription products are sold solely in the United States and are distributed through multiple channels, including sales to pharmaceutical wholesalers, using third-party logistics enterprises. 
We acquired our ADHD product portfolio in March 2021 with the acquisition of Neos Therapeutics. These commercial ADHD products are extended-release (“XR”) medications formulated in patient-friendly, orally disintegrating tablets (“ODT”) that utilize the Neos-developed microparticle modified-release drug delivery technology platform. Products containing amphetamine or methylphenidate are the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States for the treatment of ADHD. Adzenys XR-ODT (for patients six years of age and above) and Cotempla XR-ODT (for patients six to 17 years of age) are the first and only FDA-approved amphetamine and methylphenidate extended-release, orally disintegrating tablets, respectively, for the treatment of ADHD.
Our prescription pediatric portfolio includes Karbinal® ER, an extended-release carbinoxamine (antihistamine) suspension indicated to treat numerous allergic conditions for patients two years and above and Poly-Vi-Flor® and Tri-Vi-Flor®, two complementary prescription fluoride-based multi-vitamin product lines containing combinations of fluoride and vitamins in various formulations for infants and children with fluoride deficiency (Karbinal ER, Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are collectively the “Pediatric Portfolio”). These products serve established pediatric markets and offer distinct clinical features and patient benefits.
We commercialize our Rx Portfolio through our internal commercial organization that includes approximately forty territories for our ADHD portfolio and approximately eight territories for our pediatric portfolio.
Our Aytu RxConnect™ patient support program operates through a network of approximately 1,000 pharmacies to offer affordable, predictable copays and hassle-free availability to all commercially insured patients, regardless of their individual insurance plan. In addition, RxConnect seeks to significantly reduce the challenges and frustrations that health care professionals and their office staff can face when prescribing branded medications, including our medications, for their patients.
Consumer Health Segment
Our Consumer Health segment is dedicated to being a leader in developing and commercializing safe and effective non-prescription (also known as “over-the-counter” or “OTC”) medicines, personal care products, and dietary supplements to improve health and vitality. Our core products focus in categories such as hair loss, digestive health, urological health, diabetes management (with a concentration on neuropathy), and allergy. All products are intended to be used by consumers on a regular basis, and as such, we offer a monthly subscription program to allow for ongoing use and to simplify product ordering and use by patients. We acquired our Consumer Health segment, previously known as Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in February 2020 (“Innovus Acquisition”).

9



The consumer health segment currently sells directly to consumers in both the United States and Canada through e-commerce platforms including branded websites and the Amazon.com platform which utilized marketing strategies focused on search engine optimization, search marketing, and affiliate marketing. Additionally, the segment sells products through its proprietary Beyond Human Sales & Marketing platform which focuses on direct mail and newspaper advertisements, allowing consumers to purchase directly through call centers with shipment directly to their homes.
The overall strategy of the consumer health division focuses on two primary objectives:

● | developing a diversified product portfolio of unique OTC medicines, consumer health products and dietary supplements through: (a) the introduction of line extensions and reformulations of either our or third-parties’ currently marketed products; (b) the development of new proprietary OTC products and supplements; and (c) the acquisition or exclusive licensing of products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing our e-commerce presence within the United States through the development of our own websites, continued expansion on third-party platforms and through social media marketing methodologies.

Development Portfolio
AR101
On April 12, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rumpus VEDS, LLC, Rumpus Therapeutics, LLC, and Rumpus Vascular, LLC (together “Rumpus”) pursuant to which we acquired commercial global licenses, relating primarily to the pediatric-onset rare disease development asset enzastaurin, or AR101. AR101 is initially being studied for the treatment of VEDS.
AR101 is an orally available investigational first-in-class small molecule, serine/threonine kinase inhibitor of the PKC beta, PI3K and AKT pathways. AR101 has been studied in more than 3,300 patients across a range of solid and hematological tumor types in trials previously conducted by Eli Lilly & Company (“Hal”). Harry C. Dietz III, M.D. developed the first preclinical model that mimics the human condition and recapitulates VEDS, and this model serves as the basis for the plausible clinical benefit and rationale for conducting a clinical trial with AR101 in VEDS. This novel knock-in model has the same genetic mutation most prevalent in VEDS patients and is representative of the human condition in both the timing and location of vascular events. The model has generated identical structural histology and mechanical characteristics, and unbiased findings demonstrated that vascular structure alone does not lead to vascular events. Objective comparative transcriptional profiling by high-throughput RNA sequencing of the aorta displayed a molecular signature for excessive PKC/ERK cell signaling that is the purported driver of disease. PKC inhibitors proved efficacious in multiple pre-clinical and murine (mice) models and indeed prevented death due to vascular rupture.
We have secured exclusive global rights to AR101 in the fields of rare genetic pediatric onset or congenital disorders outside of oncology. AR101 is protected by a suite of pending patents being pursued in major markets globally which have been licensed from The Johns Hopkins University (“Johns Hopkins”) and have an earliest priority date of March 2017. In December 2021, the FDA granted ODD to AR101 for the treatment of EDS, inclusive of VEDS, allowing for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States. The FDA has cleared the IND application for AR101, enabling us to proceed with initiating a pivotal clinical trial for AR101. We expect to advance AR101 to a pivotal study by early-calendar year 2023.
Healight™
Our clinical-stage medical device asset, an ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light endotracheal catheter we refer to as Healight™, is being studied as a potential treatment for mechanically ventilated patients suffering from severe respiratory infections, including the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and VAP. In April 2020 we licensed global rights to the Healight technology platform from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Cedars-Sinai”). The Healight technology employs proprietary methods of administering intermittent UV-A light via a novel endotracheal medical device that, when implemented clinically, is inserted through the patient’s endotracheal tube and illuminated intermittently over a 

10



period of multiple days. Pre-clinical findings indicate the technology's effects in eradicating a wide range of viruses and bacteria, activating a key cell signaling protein, and reducing cytokine levels responsible, in part, for the ‘cytokine storm’ associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Those data, along with recently published clinical data from a five patient study studying SARS-CoV-2, have been the basis of discussions with regulatory bodies as we consider an efficient path to enable human use for the potential treatment of coronavirus in intubated patients in the intensive care unit. 
We now plan to study Healight as a prospective treatment or preventative for VAP and, as such, have completed a preclinical porcine study, demonstrating that the administration of the Healight UV-A endotracheal catheter resulted in a 46% reduction in multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA C1-17) versus controls following two separate 20-minute treatments. Based on these positive data, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and we have initiated a second, larger porcine VAP study to guide the future development of Healight for patients with VAP. 
VAP has a reported mortality rate approaching 50% in some patient populations, making it one of the most difficult-to-treat and deadly infections affecting hospitalized patients. Approximately 86% of nosocomial pneumonias are associated with mechanical ventilation and result in VAP. Between 250,000 and 300,000 VAP cases per year occur in the United States alone, which is an incidence rate of 5 to 10 cases per 1,000 hospital admissions. VAP afflicts up to 15% of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units.
We received the first issued patent protecting Healight™ which covers methods of treating a patient for an infectious condition inside the patient's body through the insertion of a UV-light-emitting delivery tube inside a respiratory cavity of the patient at specific UV-A light wavelengths. The term of this patent extends to August of 2040.
We do not anticipate further significant development without a partner to finance further development. This could be in the shape of out-license of a portion, or all commercial rights to Healight or an asset sale.
OUR STRATEGY
Our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical company that improves the lives of patients and healthcare consumers. We will do this by employing a focused approach of in-licensing, acquiring, developing, and commercializing novel prescription therapeutics and consumer health products. Our primary focus is on commercializing innovative prescription products that address conditions frequently developed in childhood. We also commercialize consumer healthcare products through efficient e-commerce and direct-to-patient platforms. Importantly, we are also focused on developing a late-stage pipeline of novel, promising therapeutics that address unmet medical needs, with a focus on pediatric-onset rare diseases. Our lead product candidate, AR101, is a therapeutic that, if proven safe and effective and ultimately approved, would be the first and only approved treatment for VEDS.
Our strategic priorities are to continue to increase revenues from our prescription and consumer health portfolios, enhance our financial performance through operational and manufacturing efficiencies and portfolio prioritization, and advance and expand our product pipeline focused on rare and complex disorders. Specifically, we intend to:

● | continue to grow our commercial branded, revenue-generating products, by increasing product sales and improving patient access. Our primary commercial objective is to drive revenue growth of our ADHD and pediatric brands, with a focus on Adzenys XR-ODT, Cotempla XR-ODT, Poly-Vi-Flor, Tri-Vi-Flor, and Karbinal ER. We expect to increase market share using our internal commercial organization and leveraging our advanced analytics platform to optimize sales force performance and increase both the breadth, or number of healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) prescribing our medicines, and the depth, or the number of appropriate patients per HCP for our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | leverage our RxConnect patient support program, which is designed to reduce access barriers to medicines facing patients and HCPs by providing coverage for all commercially insured patients, regardless of their individual insurance plan, thus establishing an affordable and predictable monthly co-pay for patients, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




eliminating many of the hassles facing HCPs and their staffs by improving availability of Aytu products at participating pharmacies;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | grow our consumer health business by driving growth of our current consumer health brands and introducing new products into our consumer marketing channels. Through a dual approach that employs both e-commerce commercial and direct-to-consumer strategies to sell existing and future products, we expect to reach an increasing number of healthcare consumers and drive revenue growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve gross margins for our ADHD product franchise through the transfer of manufacturing of Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT to a well-established, global commercial manufacturing organization, a transition that is expected to occur in mid-calendar 2023;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advance the development of AR101 enzastaurin to address a significant unmet need in VEDS, a rare, devastating, pediatric-onset disease with no currently approved therapies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | progress Healight development for VAP. We are collaborating with leading researchers at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona on a large, proof-of-concept pre-clinical study for VAP.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe our history of acquiring companies and in-licensing and acquiring products and pipeline assets, along with our success in building out commercial teams and executing product launch and growth strategies, is a distinct competitive advantage. Our transactional adeptness and execution orientation enable us to continue to seek growth opportunities through both organic growth and opportunistic in-licensing or strategic acquisitions. Further, our commercial infrastructure and distribution capability is scalable and lends itself to additional on-market assets and future product candidates that fit within our core therapeutic focus. As such, in the near term, we may seek to leverage our commercial model and infrastructure by expanding our commercial portfolio with external product opportunities as we have done since our inception. Near to longer term, we believe our prescription and consumer health businesses will provide resources to invest in and develop our pediatric-onset rare disease asset pipeline.

ADHD Portfolio 
ADHD Market and Treatment Options
ADHD is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity that interferes with functioning and/or development. ADHD can have a profound impact on an individual’s life, causing disruption at school, work, home and in relationships. It is one of the most common developmental disorders in children and often persists into adulthood. In 2011, an estimated 11% of children in the United States ages 4 to 17 had previously received an ADHD diagnosis. A 2006 study estimated 4.4% of adults in the United States experience ADHD symptoms. Current ADHD treatment guidelines recommend a multi-faceted approach that uses medications in conjunction with behavioral interventions.
In 2021, approximately 84.8 million prescriptions for medications with ADHD labeling were written in the United States and generated approximately $22.6 billion in sales. Approximately 91% of these prescriptions were for stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which are and have been the standard of care for several decades. Methylphenidate and amphetamine prescriptions generated $5.6 billion and $11.3 billion in sales, respectively, in 2020 in the United States. A few non-stimulant medications are also available, but evidence of their efficacy for treating ADHD symptoms is less compelling. The market for ADHD medications outside of the United States is less developed, but we believe it will continue to grow as recognition and awareness of the disorder increase.

12



Extended-release, or long acting, dosage forms of stimulant medications are the standard of care for treating ADHD, making up approximately 44% of ADHD prescriptions. The most prescribed extended-release medications for ADHD, Concerta® and Adderall XR® (and each of their generic equivalents), are long-acting versions of previously short-acting methylphenidate and amphetamine medications, respectively. Most of these extended-release dosage forms allow for once-daily dosing in the morning, which eliminates the need to re-dose during the day. Our products, Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT, are extended-release orally disintegrating tablets that allow for once-daily dosing in the morning based upon an internally developed proprietary microparticle delivery technology.
There is significant competition in the ADHD market, including from well-established companies, many of whom have substantially greater financial, technical and commercial resources than we do, and entrenched existing ADHD products. For example:

● | amphetamine XR is currently marketed in the United States by (i) Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited under the brand names Adderall XR®, Vyvanse® and Mydayis® and (ii) Tris Pharma, Inc. (“Tris”), under the brand names Dyanavel® XR, Dyanavel® XR tablets ; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | methylphenidate XR is marketed in the United States by (i) Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the brand name Concerta®, (ii) Tris under the brand names Quillivant XR® and QuilliChew ER®, (iii) Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP under the brand name Aptensio XR®, (iv) Ironshore Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the brand name Jornay PM®, (v) Alora Pharmaceuticals under the name Methylphenidate HCl ER 72 mg Tablets, (vi) Novartis under the brand names Focalin XR® and Ritalin LA® and (vii) Azstarys®, a product developed by KemPharm and sold by Corium.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a non-stimulant treatment for ADHD was approved by the FDA and commercially launched by Supernus in the U.S in 2021 is sold under the brand name Qelbree®.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further, makers of branded drugs could also enhance their own formulations in a manner that competes with our enhancements of these drugs. We are also aware of efforts by several pharmaceutical companies with ADHD medications in clinical development, including Vallon Pharma, Cingulate Therapeutics, Sunovion, NLS Pharma and Neurovance, a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 
Our ADHD Product Portfolio
Our modified-release drug delivery technology platform has enabled us to create XR-ODT formulations of amphetamine and methylphenidate. This was achieved by developing an extended-release profile that allows for once daily dosing and an ODT formulation that allows for easier administration and ingestion and twelve-hour duration of action.
Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT are the first and only XR-ODT products for the treatment of ADHD. These XR-ODT products offer unique attributes to ADHD patients and caregivers, including:

● | ease of administration and ingestion because they disintegrate rapidly in the mouth and may be taken without water;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | taste-masking of bitter ADHD medications, with flavoring options;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prevention of “cheeking,” the practice of hiding medication in the mouth and later spitting it out rather than swallowing it; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | convenient single-unit blister-packaging, which is both portable and discrete.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adzenys XR-ODT: Amphetamine XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD
Adzenys XR-ODT is approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD in patients six years and older. We believe Adzenys XR-ODT is the first and only amphetamine XR-ODT approved for the treatment of ADHD. The NDA for Adzenys XR-ODT relies on the efficacy and safety data that formed the basis of FDA approval for the listed drug, Adderall XR, 30 mg, together with bioequivalence, bioavailability, and aggregate safety data from the Adzenys XR-ODT clinical program. Adzenys XR-ODT contains amphetamine loaded onto a mixture of immediate-release and polymer-coated delayed-release resin particles, which are formulated and compressed into an ODT along with other typical tableting excipients using our patented rapidly disintegrating ionic masking (“RDIM”) technology. The result is amphetamine with an in vivo extended-release profile delivered through a tablet that quickly disintegrates in the mouth without the need for water. Adzenys XR-ODT is available in 30-day supply, child-resistant blister packs.
The suite of composition-of-matter patents for Adzenys XR-ODT are scheduled to expire in 2026 and 2032. These patents are listed in the FDA’s publication of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations (the “Orange Book”). In addition, we entered into a settlement agreement with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. (“Actavis”), which resolved all ongoing litigation involving Adzenys XR-ODT patents and Actavis’ ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT. Under the agreement with Actavis, Actavis (acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries) has the right to manufacture and market its generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on September 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. No tentative approval from the FDA has been received by Teva to date. 
In conjunction with the approval of the Adzenys XR-ODT NDA, the FDA has required us to conduct certain clinical studies in preschool (age four to five years) children with ADHD as a post-marketing requirement. A pharmacokinetic study in this population was completed in 2018, and we are in discussions with the FDA to further clarify the design protocols required to conduct the remaining studies.
Cotempla XR-ODT: Methylphenidate XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD
The FDA approved Cotempla XR-ODT treatment of ADHD in patients six to seventeen years old. The Cotempla XR-ODT NDA relies on the efficacy and safety data that formed the basis of FDA approval for the listed drug, Metadate CD®, together with bioavailability/bioequivalence data and efficacy/safety data from the Cotempla XR-ODT clinical program. The results of the Cotempla XR-ODT Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trial showed a statistically significant improvement in ADHD symptom control compared to placebo across the classroom day. Onset of effect was observed within one hour post-dose and persisted through 12 hours. No serious adverse events were reported during the study, and the adverse event profile was consistent with the drug’s mechanism of action.
Cotempla XR-ODT contains methylphenidate loaded onto a mixture of immediate-release and polymer-coated delayed-release resin particles, which are formulated and compressed into an ODT along with other typical tableting excipients using our RDIM technology. The result is methylphenidate with an in vivo extended-release profile delivered through a tablet that quickly disintegrates in the mouth. Cotempla XR-ODT is available in 30-day supply, child-resistant blister packs. We believe Cotempla XR-ODT is the first methylphenidate XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD, providing onset-of-effect within one hour and a 12-hour duration.
We hold composition-of-matter patents in the U.S. which we expect will provide Cotempla XR-ODT intellectual property protection until 2032, and a recent method-of-use patent was issued which will extend protection until 2038. These patents are listed in the Orange Book. In addition, Neos entered into a settlement agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”), which resolved all ongoing litigation involving the Cotempla XR-ODT patents and Teva’s ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT. Under the agreement with Teva, Neos granted Teva the right to manufacture and market its generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances. 
In conjunction with the approval of the Cotempla XR-ODT NDA, the FDA required us to perform additional clinical studies in preschool (age four to five years) children with ADHD as a post-marketing requirement. A pharmacokinetic study in this population was completed in 2019. In light of a new draft guidance for industry that was 

14



published in May 2019, “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Developing Stimulant Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry,” and we remain in discussions with the FDA to gain concurrence on the design of the protocols required to meet the remaining post-marketing requirements.
Pediatric Portfolio
Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor: Our fluoride-based multivitamin prescription supplement product line for infants and children
Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are two complementary prescription fluoride-based supplement product lines containing combinations of vitamins and sodium fluoride in various oral formulations. These prescription supplements are prescribed for infants and children to treat or prevent fluoride deficiency due to poor diet or low levels of fluoride in drinking water and other sources while also providing multi-vitamin support and folic acid supplementation. Because these products contain at least .25 mg of sodium fluoride, Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are regulated as prescription products.
Fluoride supplementation has been proven to protect teeth from decay. Community water fluoridation prevents tooth decay by providing frequent and consistent contact with low levels of fluoride. By keeping the teeth strong and solid, fluoride stops cavities from forming and can rebuild the tooth’s surface. Community water fluoridation began in the United States in 1945 and is the process of adjusting the amount of fluoride in drinking water to a level recommended for preventing tooth decay. As of 2016, more than 200 million people, or nearly 3 in 4 Americans who use public water supplies, drank water with enough fluoride to prevent tooth decay. However, American children living in municipalities that do not fluoridate the water supply or in rural areas that rely on well water supplies do not receive recommended levels of fluoride through fluoridation. Therefore, these children often require daily fluoride supplementation as part of their mineral and vitamin intake. In many instances, physicians prescribe fluoride-based multi-vitamins (Vitamins A, B, C, D and folic acid) regularly to supplement their fluoride intake and enable convenient supplementation. Infants are prescribed multi-vitamin drops while older children are prescribed tablet formulations.
In 2021, 9.5 million multi-vitamin prescriptions were written in the U.S. Of those, prescription multi-vitamins containing sodium fluoride accounted for 1.5 million total prescriptions. Common multi-vitamin combinations contain vitamins A, B, C, D and E, but no other prescription pediatric multi-vitamin products contain Metafolin, which makes the Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor product lines distinct, single-source brands. Other brands include Tri-Vite (marketed by Method Pharmaceuticals), Floriva (marketed by BonGeo Pharmaceuticals) and Quflora (marketed by Carwin Pharmaceutical Associates).
Poly-Vi-Flor is available in both chewable tablet and oral liquid suspension multivitamin formulations in six different product presentations: Poly-Vi-Flor Chewable Tablets .25 MG, .50 MG, and 1 MG tablets, Poly-Vi-Flor Chewable Tablets with Iron, Poly-Vi-Flor Oral Suspension and Poly-Vi-Flor Oral Suspension with Iron. Poly-Vi-Flor contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B1, B2, B3, and B6, Vitamin C, Sodium Fluoride in various doses and Metafolin, a proprietary, trademarked L-methylfolate form of folic acid developed by Merck & Cie (“Merck”).
Tri-Vi-Flor is available as an oral liquid suspension in two different strengths (.25 MG and .50 MG fluoride) containing Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Sodium Fluoride, Sodium Benzoate and Metafolin. By virtue of its Metafolin content, Tri-Vi-Flor offers a similar clinical profile: a fluoride-based multivitamin containing body-ready Metafolin.
Metafolin® is Merck’s manufactured calcium salt of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolic or L-methylfolate. It is a ‘body ready’ alternative to folic acid and offers good stability, solubility, and bioavailability. Folic acid supplementation is recommended in various patient groups, but a significant number of patients have difficulty metabolizing folate due to an enzymatic deficiency characterized by a genetic mutation affecting the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or MTHFR. MTHFR converts ingested folate (such as supplemented folic acid) into L-methylfolate, the body’s usable form. Clinical studies have demonstrated that 75% of pediatric patients may have one MTHFR genetic mutation while 40% may have two mutations. These mutations lead to impaired function of the enzyme and cause folate deficiencies. 

15



Metafolin is unaffected by the MTHFR mutation, thereby directly delivering bioavailable L-methylfolate, and offering a distinct clinical advantage over other folic acid supplements.
The core family of patent covering Arcofolin has a priority date of March 31, 2017 and describes a crystalline sodium salt of 5-methyl-(6S)- tetrahydrofolic acid wherein the molar ratio of 5-methyl-(6S)-tetrahydrofolic acid to sodium is from 1:0.5 to 1:1.5 (in mol/mol) and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof, as well as a process of obtaining the same. If issued, the standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent would expire in 2037.
The prescription multi-vitamin market is dominated by generic products, with brands accounting for 3.4% of the multivitamin plus fluoride market. Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor primarily compete in the generic prescription multi-vitamin fluoride market and with the brands of FLORIVA and QFLORA.
Karbinal ER: Extended release carbinoxamine oral suspension for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergies
Karbinal® ER (carbinoxamine maleate extended-release oral suspension) is an H1 receptor antagonist (antihistamine) indicated to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis due to inhalant allergens and food, mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema, dermatographism, as therapy for anaphylactic reactions adjunctive to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute manifestations have been controlled, and amelioration of the severity of allergic reactions to blood or plasma for patients two years of age and above.
Over 50 million Americans suffer from allergies in any given year, and allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. Numerous allergy treatments exist to address allergies and allergic symptoms depending upon the symptom(s). Oral antihistamines are considered a mainstay of allergy treatment, and the prescription antihistamine market is a large category with approximately 52 million prescriptions written in 2021. The prescription antihistamine category is dominated by generic products and consists of first generation and second-generation molecules. Generally, first-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors and pass the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly block histaminic receptors, but they do not pass the blood-brain barrier. First generation antihistamines, which are generally characterized as more sedating, accounted for 6% of 2021 total prescriptions, while non-sedating, second generation antihistamines accounted for 94% of total prescriptions. The most widely prescribed oral, second-generation antihistamines are cetirizine (brand name Zyrtec®) and loratadine (brand name Claritin®). Diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl®) is the most widely prescribed first-generation molecule.
Karbinal ER is the only FDA-approved, 12-hour carbinoxamine oral suspension and is an effective antihistamine with a broad range of indications. Karbinal ER is positioned as a second-line allergy treatment for patients who continue to suffer from allergic symptoms following initial treatment with a second-generation, non-sedating antihistamine. Further, as Karbinal ER is an oral suspension formulation, children are the primary target patient given their preference for liquid treatments and, in many cases, their inability to swallow tablets or capsules. Karbinal ER is indicated for children as young as two years of age. Karbinal has a pleasant strawberry-banana taste and is available in 480 mL bottles.
Through a supply and distribution agreement with Tris, we own exclusively rights to distribute Karbinal ER in the U.S. through August 2032, unless the agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to the termination provisions in the agreement. As part of the agreement, we pay sales-based royalties based on net revenue. Additionally, we are committed to make annual minimum payments to through 2025. 
Two core patents protect Karbinal ER in the U.S., and both parents are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. The first patent describes a coated drug-ion exchange resin complex comprising a core composed of a drug complexed with a pharmaceutically acceptable ion-exchange resin. The priority date for this family is March 29, 2009, so the standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent will expire in 2029. The second patent describes an aqueous liquid suspension containing a coated drug-ion exchange resin complex comprising a core molecule complexed with a pharmaceutically acceptable ion-exchange resin and an uncoated ion exchange resin complex. The priority date for this family is June 15, 2007, so the standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent will expire in 2027.

Karbinal ER faces competition from over-the-counter (“OTC”) products such as non-sedating antihistamines, sedating antihistamines as well as nasal steroids.
Consumer Health Segment
We acquired our consumer health business through the acquisition of Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2020. The consumer health business is focused on OTC medicines and consumer health products designed for in-home treatment of medical conditions and ailments to help customers take care of themselves and their families in order to lead healthy lives. Now marketed under the name Aytu Consumer Health, we commercialize over 20 products in the U.S. and Canada through two distinct marketing channels: e-commerce platforms such as our website and Amazon.com and direct-to-consumer marketing channels utilizing our proprietary Beyond Human marketing and sales platform. 
We classify our products into three categories:

● | ANDA/Device OTC products, which compete in large consumer health categories and are marketed via e-commerce strategies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | OTC monograph products, which compete in large categories; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | personal care products, which are proprietary products with strong scientific and clinical support.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following represents the core Aytu Consumer Health products:

● | Regoxidine® - for Men & Women – proprietary over-the-counter aerosol foam that works to treat hair loss in both men and women.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | OmepraCareDR® - acid reducer to treat frequent heartburn.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Urivarx® - dietary supplement to support healthy bladder function consisting of a proprietary blend of well published botanical ingredients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Trexar®* - supplement formulated to support healthy nerves targeting the TRPA1 pathway in both men and women which controls how we interpret both hot and cold sensations on the skin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diabasens® / NeuriteRx® - scientifically formulated combination of three effective and extensively clinically tested and published ingredients to improve soft tissue pain or leg and foot discomfort.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FlutiCare® - allergy relieving nasal spray proven to offer 24-hour relief of both nose and sinus-related allergy symptoms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continue to grow this business through organic growth, acquisition of new products and exclusive distribution rights and introduction of new products developed internally. In our fiscal 2022, we launched 12 new products in our product line. In addition, in June 2021, we signed an exclusive agency supply and distribution agreement with Amman Pharmaceutical Industries to exclusively market numerous sterile ophthalmic, otic, and nasal products in the U.S. that compete with large national OTC medicine brands.
We own over 180 trademarks for products in our consumer health portfolio and own or license patents covering 15 of these products. 
The OTC pharmaceutical market is highly competitive with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors that are actively engaged in all phases of the business. We believe that competition in the sale of our products will be based primarily on efficacy, regulatory compliance, brand awareness, availability, product safety and 

17



price. Our products are subject to competition from alternate therapies in the form of generic products and other competitive branded products in the marketplace.
Competing in the branded products business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying technological innovations and/or improved pricing. Successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the efficacy, safety, and value to consumers. Based upon business conditions and other factors, we regularly reexamine our business strategies and may from time to time reallocate our resources from one product category to another, withdraw from a product category or add an additional product category in order to maximize our overall growth opportunities.
Some of our existing products compete with one or more products marketed by very large pharmaceutical or consumer healthcare companies that have much greater financial resources for developing and marketing their products. Many competitors have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we directly compete with them for the same markets and/or products, their financial and market strength could prevent us from capturing a meaningful share of those markets.
MANUFACTURING
ADHD Product Portfolio
For the production of our ADHD products, we lease one manufacturing site in Grand Prairie, Texas. This facility has 77,112 square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space and contains dedicated current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) manufacturing suites for both Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT. We hold U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) manufacturing and analytical licenses and maintain storage and use of Schedule II through IV controlled substances. The manufacture of our products is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.
We are in the process of a technical transfer to outsource the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a CMO. The transfer of the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products requires several steps including knowledge and method transfer, manufacturing of materials for feasibility study and confirmation batch materials, bioequivalence studies, inspections from regulatory agencies, and regulatory filings. If we are able to establish bioequivalence between the current manufactured products and the products manufactured at the prospective CMO, we believe we will be able to submit a pre-approval supplement for the transfer to the FDA by the end of calendar year 2022 or early 2023, which in turn could allow us to be able to produce these products through our CMO in mid to late-calendar 2023.
Pediatric Product Portfolio
We contract with CMOs for the manufacture and testing of our Pediatric Product portfolio. We have entered into the following key supply agreements for the commercial manufacture and supply of certain of these products:

● | A supply agreement with Tris Pharma for the supply of Karbinal. This agreement terminates in August 2033, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are not purchased under any supply agreement and only on a purchase order basis with a CMO based in the U.S.. Merck & Cie is responsible for providing either Metafolin or Arcofolin to our designated CMO. We have established relationships with U.S. CMOs for the production of both Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe our third-party manufacturers have adequate capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet anticipated commercial demands. As we rely on CMOs, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record-keeping, manufacturing 

18



processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among other activities. Our systems and our contractors are required to comply with these regulations, and we assess this compliance regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.
Consumer Health Segment
The Consumer Health segment maintains relationships with a number of manufacturers from which it obtains its products. With the exception of a settlement agreement with our manufacturer of FlutiCare which establishes a minimum number of batches which may be purchased, there are no manufacturing agreements in place that contain minimum requirements. Aside from those products under the ANDA classification, most products may be manufactured by a variety of manufacturers, and therefore we engage those who can produce product most cost efficiently and on a timely basis.
Research and Development
A key aspect of our growth strategy is our continued investment in our evolving and expanding research and development actives. We actively explore new treatment options for patients including novel compounds and innovative medical device technologies.
Our Development Pipeline: AR101 (enzastaurin for the treatment of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (VEDS))
AR101 (enzastaurin) is an orally available investigational first-in-class small molecule, serine/threonine kinase inhibitor of the protein kinase C (PKC) beta, PI3K and AKT pathways. AR101 has been studied in more than 3,300 patients across a range of solid and hematological tumor types. AR101 was originally developed by Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), and worldwide rights were acquired by Denovo Biopharma (“Denovo”) in September 2014 following Lilly’s discontinuation of the enzastaurin development program. Orphan drug designation in DLBCL and GBM has been granted by the FDA and the EMA. Fast Track qualification for the first-line treatment of GBM was also granted by the FDA in July 2020. Pivotal Phase 3 studies for both newly diagnosed DLBCL and GBM patients are currently being conducted by Denovo.
VEDS is a rare genetic disorder typically diagnosed in childhood and characterized by arterial aneurysm, dissection and rupture, bowel rupture and rupture of the gravid uterus. VEDS is the severe subtype of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, affecting 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. VEDS results from pathogenic variants in the COL3A1 gene, which encodes the chains of type III procollagen, a major protein in vessel walls and hollow organs. Twenty-five percent of VEDS patients have a first complication by the age of 20 years, and more than 80 percent have at least one complication by the age of 40. VEDS patients have a median lifespan of 51 years. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for VEDS.
The research underpinning the application of enzastaurin for the treatment of VEDS has been conducted by Dr. Harry (Hal) Dietz and his research colleagues. Dr. Dietz is the Victor A. McKusick Professor of Genetics in the departments of medicine, pediatrics, and molecular biology and genetics at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the William S. Smilow Center for Marfan Syndrome Research. He has also been an investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997. Dr. Dietz is a leading scientist in the field of genetic connective tissue disorders and developed the first preclinical model that mimics the human condition and recapitulates VEDS. His group’s research findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in February 2020. The VEDS knock-in murine (mouse) preclinical model from Dr. Dietz has the same genetic mutation most prevalent in VEDS patients and is representative of the human condition in both the timing and location of vascular events. The model has generated identical structural histology and mechanical characteristics, and unbiased findings demonstrated that structure alone does not lead to vascular events. Objective comparative transcriptional profiling by high-throughput RNA sequencing of the aorta displayed a consistent molecular signature for excessive PKC/ERK cell signaling that is now known to be the driver of disease. Based on the scientific rationale for intervention along the PKC/ERK pathway, PKC inhibition and treatment with PKCβ inhibitors proved efficacious in multiple pre-clinical and murine studies and indeed prevented death due to vascular rupture.

19



Taken together, the pre-clinical efficacy model along with extensive previous pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability findings from Lilly’s IND and NDA provide significant support for once daily dosing of 500mg of enzastaurin in the potential treatment of patients with VEDS. Given the nature of this rare disease, the high unmet medical need, the well-characterized nature of AR101, and guidance from the FDA, we expect to advance AR101 to a pivotal safety and efficacy study in VEDS patients which we refer to as the PREVEnt Trial. The development plan includes a well-controlled global clinical trial designed to demonstrate that AR101 delays time to intervention related to arterial rupture, dissection or pseudoaneurysm patients in VEDS patients whose VEDS diagnoses have been confirmed with COL3A1 gene mutations. Additional data will also be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of AR101 in preventing intestinal rupture, uterine rupture, pneumothorax, and any of the severe clinical events related to VEDS confirmed with COL3A1 gene mutations, as adjudicated by an independent event committee. In fiscal 2022 we received Orphan Drug Designation for AR101 in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome including VEDS and in Europe, allowing for seven years’ marketing exclusivity in the United States and ten years in Europe. We also received Fast Track designation for AR101 in VEDS by the FDA, allowing for an accelerated review timeline upon submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) and more frequent interaction with the FDA during the development process.
AR101 is protected by a suite of pending patents being pursued in major markets globally which have been licensed from Johns Hopkins and have an earliest priority date of March 2017. The cornerstone of the intellectual property family surrounds enzastaurin initially targeting the treatment of VEDS focused on the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions which include Europe, Japan, China, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea. This pending patent provides compositions and methods for treating VEDS and associated connective tissue disorders and has a priority date of October 16, 2018. Additional molecule intellectual property is afforded through the license with Denovo whose pending patent provides methods and compositions for the prediction of the activity of enzastaurin and has a priority date of September 1, 2016. The third pending patent provides methods and compositions for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Marfan syndrome and related diseases, disorders and conditions and has a priority date of March 2, 2017, in select geographies. The fourth patent, titled “Pathway Targets for the Treatment of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,” deepens the scientific evidence of the pathophysiology of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and is highly confirmatory of the therapeutic approach for AR101/Enzastaurin. 
​
Healight Medical Device Platform Technology
In April 2020, we signed an exclusive worldwide license with Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, California, to develop and commercialize the Healight Platform Technology ("Healight" or the “Healight Platform”) in respiratory fields of use. This medical device technology platform is currently envisioned as an endotracheal, UV-A light catheter, developed by scientists at Cedars-Sinai, is being studied as a potential first-in-class treatment for viral and bacterial respiratory infections. The Healight Platform has been in development since 2016 by the Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) team at Cedars-Sinai. We and our research collaborators engaged in clinical and scientific research to establish the clinical utility of Healight as an intervention for critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with an initial focus on SARS-CoV-2 infections, and we are now pivoting research efforts to assess the clinical benefits of Healight in VAP.
The agreement with Cedars-Sinai grants us a license to all patent and development related technology rights for the intra-corporeal therapeutic use of ultraviolet light in the field of endotracheal and nasopharyngeal applications. The term of the agreement is on a country-by-country basis and will expire on the latest of the date upon which the last to expire valid claim shall expire, ten years after the first bona fide commercial sale of such licensed product in a country, or the expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory agency. 
As part of the Healight development plan we entered into an agreement with Sterling Medical Devices ("Sterling") to support our product development efforts. This agreement with Sterling is a fee-for-service development agreement for which we pay Sterling on a project-by-project basis.
Given the significant reduction in cases and severity of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential for broader, longer-term clinical applications for Healight, we are now evaluating the Healight platform as a potential treatment for VAP, a severe respiratory infection caused by the infiltration of pathogens through a hospitalized, mechanically ventilated patient’s 

20



endotracheal tube. VAP has a reported mortality rate approaching 50% in some patient populations, making it one of the most difficult-to-treat and deadly infections affecting hospitalized patients. Approximately 86% of nosocomial pneumonias are associated with mechanical ventilation and result in VAP. Between 250,000 and 300,000 VAP cases per year occur in the United States alone, which is an incidence rate of 5 to 10 cases per 1,000 hospital admissions. VAP afflicts up to 15% of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units.
We conducted a proof-of-concept study with Healight at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona under the supervision of principal investigator Antonio Torres, M.D., Ph.D., FERS, FCCP, ATSF, Senior Consultant, Pulmonology Department - one of the only centers in the world with access to a specific, well-characterized porcine model of VAP caused by oropharyngeal secretions colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the study, administration of the Healight UVA endotracheal catheter resulted in a 46% reduction in multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA C1-17) versus controls following two separate 20-minute treatments. Based on these positive data, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and the company have initiated a second, larger porcine VAP study to guide the future development of Healight for patients with VAP and expect results from this study by the end of the calendar 2022 or early calendar 2023.
Given our focus on growing our commercial Rx and Consumer Health businesses and advancing AR101/enzastaurin, we are considering various strategic options to maximize the value of Healight including out-licensing regional or global rights to a third-party or divesting the asset. 
Other intellectual property rights
We seek trademark protection in the United States when appropriate. We currently have registered trademarks for Aytu, Neos Therapeutics, Innovus Pharma, Beyond Human, Supplement Hunt, Healight, Poly-Vi-Flor, Adzenys, Adzenys XR-ODT, Adzenys ER and Cotempla XR-ODT in the United States, as well as for a number of our consumer health products and two for our DTRS technology.
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party intellectual property holders.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The FDCA and the FDA's implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, sale, advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates. We may seek approval for, and market, our products in other countries in the future. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences.
Development and Approval
Under the FDCA, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs in the case of new drugs, or PMAs or 510(k)s in the case of medical devices, may require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant, including the following:
Preclinical Testing. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the toxicity and dosing of the product. 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. 

● | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to evaluate the safety, metabolism and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21




pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population and are designed to develop initial data regarding the product's effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential AEs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug's overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, multi-site, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen. Phase 3 data often form the core basis on which the FDA evaluates a drug’s safety and effectiveness when considering the product application.

Medical Device Regulations
The FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval (“PMA”) before introducing it into the U.S. market. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to another legally U.S. marketed device. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate. A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it:

● | has the same intended use as the predicate; and
--+------------------------------------------------

​

● | has the same technological characteristics as the predicate; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | has the same intended use as the predicate; and
--+------------------------------------------------

​

● | has different technological characteristics and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | the information submitted to FDA demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed device.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (“MDR”) requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
Post-Approval Regulation
Once approved, drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or manufacturing problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials, changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, or the implementation of other risk management measures, including distribution-related restrictions, if there are new safety information developments.

22



DEA Regulation
Several of our approved products are each a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, because Adzenys XR-ODT and Adzenys ER contain amphetamine, Cotempla XR-ODT contains methylphenidate, ZolpiMist contains zolpidem tartrate, Tuzistra XR contains codeine and our Tussionex generic contains hydrocodone. Because amphetamine, methylphenidate and hydrocodone are all Schedule II controlled substances, The DEA has Adzenys XR-ODT, Adzenys ER, Cotempla XR-ODT and our Tussionex generic listed and regulated as Schedule II controlled substances. Tuzistra XR is listed and regulated as a Schedule III controlled substance, while ZolpiMist is listed and regulated as a Schedule IV controlled substance. None of our pediatric products (Poly-Vi-Flor, Tri-Vi-Flor and Karbinal ER) are considered “controlled substances.”
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. 
The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in and/or imported into the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our or our manufacturers’ quotas of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our or our manufacturers’ quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration. Additionally, we use third-party logistics firms to inventory and fill sales orders for our commercial portfolio.
We contract with third parties for the manufacture and testing of Karbinal, Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor. Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor and ZolpiMist are not supplied under any contract. We have entered into the following key supply agreements for the commercial manufacture and supply of certain of these products:

● | A supply agreement with Tris for the supply of Karbinal. This agreement terminates in August 2033, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are not purchased under any supply agreement and only on a purchase order basis with a CMO based in the U.S. Merck & Cie is responsible for providing either Metafolin or Arcofolin to our designated CMO.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe our third-party manufacturers have adequate capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet anticipated commercial demands. Because we rely on CMOs, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among other activities. Our systems and our contractors are required to comply with these regulations, and we assess this compliance regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.
For the production of our ADHD products, we lease one manufacturing site in Grand Prairie, Texas. This facility has 77,112 square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space, and contains dedicated cGMP manufacturing suites for both Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT. We hold DEA manufacturing and analytical licenses, and maintain storage and use of Schedule II through IV controlled substances.

We are in the process of a tech transfer to outsource the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a CMO. The transfer of the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products requires several steps including knowledge and method transfer, manufacturing of materials for feasibility study and confirmation batch materials, bioequivalence studies and regulatory filings. We believe we will be able to submit a pre-approval supplement for the transfer to the FDA by the end of calendar year 2022, which in turn could allow us to be able to produce these products through our CMO in mid-calendar 2023
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of June 30, 2022, we employed 164 full-time employees, including 56 who are involved in operations, 8 who are directly involved in research and development, 51 who are involved in commercialization and 49 who are involved in general and administrative activities. All of our colleagues are located in the U.S. Of these colleagues, 37% are female and 63% are male. Our colleagues are not represented by a labor union. We do not have written employment contracts with most of our colleagues.
Our values – team-oriented, hard-working, relentlessly determined, integrity, visionary, entrepreneurial, and service-oriented - are built on the foundation that the colleagues we hire and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation, and productivity, which spur our success. This culture depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talents and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. Providing market competitive pay and benefit programs, opportunities to participate in the success they help create, while engaging colleagues in important dialogue regarding organization performance, we create a culture of inclusion in which all colleagues have the opportunity to thrive.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented modifications to our normal operations, including a work-from-home policy in accordance with guidance issued by the CDC, the WHO and state and local authorities. In addition, employees were provided multiple communications related to COVID safety through their managers, on the employee portal website, and in posters located around the facilities which indicate workplace safety guidelines for those employees who continue to work from our offices and manufacturing facilities. Following COVID, we have maintained a flexible work policy for our non-production employees that has enabled a high level of productivity and communication across the organization.
