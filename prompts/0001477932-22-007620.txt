Overview and Mission

Our mission is to be one of the market leaders in the adult day care center market and to be a leader in related technologies in the health and wellness category. We believe that this is a fragmented market, and this is an opportune time to consolidate and grow our SarahCare brand. We have an experienced management team of adult day care industry and financial markets executives that have strong relationships in the industry. 

Operational Overview – SarahCare, our wholly owned subsidiary

SarahCare provides health-care related services and companionship for older adults, aged 60 and above, and for adults aged 18-60 who are in need of health-related care and supervision (a “SARAH Business”) since February 1985. In 1985, the very first SarahCare Center opened its doors in Canton, Ohio. Originally called S.A.R.A.H. (Senior Adult Recreation and Health), the facility was one of the first intergenerational sites in the U.S. The senior adult day care center was located next to a child day care center and served as a training and research site for the development of other unique intergenerational programs across the country. Eventually, directors transitioned S.A.R.A.H.’s name to Sarah Center and, finally, to SarahCare demonstrating the philosophy of care administered to our seniors and their families.

We grant franchises for the operation of a SARAH Business. A SARAH Business provides non-medical care for elderly individuals and others in need of health-related care and supervision who desire compassionate care and stimulating activity in a secure, structured environment. We provide service that offers an effective solution for individuals who are in need of support services in order to continue living in their communities. 

Currently, SarahCare operates 26 unique locations in the United States (24 franchised locations and 2 corporate owned centers) and internationally in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Center members who visit any one of our locations across 13 states are offered daytime care and activities ranging from exercise and health-care related needs on a daily basis to nursing care and salon services. Visitors benefit from additional services that include specialized dietary menus and engaging social activities allowing them to continue to lead active and enriched lives.

Accreditation

SarahCare’s two corporate-owned centers have achieved accreditation through the Aging Services division of CARF, an independent, non-profit accreditor of health and human services. Through accreditation, CARF assists service providers in improving the quality of their services, demonstrating value, and meeting internationally recognized organizational and program standards. The accreditation process applies sets of standards to service areas and business practices during an on-site survey. Accreditation, however, is an ongoing process, signaling to the public that a service provider is committed to continuously improving services, encouraging feedback, and serving the center. Accreditation also demonstrates a provider’s commitment to enhance its performance, manage its risk, and distinguish its service delivery.

Who we care for

We have trained staff including nurses who specialize in caring for those with various impairments and health related problems, including but not limited to: frailty and physical dependence, memory impairment, stroke and Parkinson’s disease, chronic diseases, and isolation and depression. 

Nursing assistants and other trained staff are always there to assist participants in ambulating and moving through all of our activities throughout the day. Activities are adapted for specific physical challenges so that no one ever feels left out. Yes, seniors who are wheelchair bound are very welcome in our centers. We handle a loved one’s challenging issues with care and consideration. If a loved one is wheelchair bound, multiple staff members are available at any given time if they need the assistance of more than one person. If a loved one needs help with toileting and/or bathing, we have specially trained staff to assist them. Our bathing areas are designed to give them as much privacy and dignity as possible.

Activities - Our centers offer versatile daily services and activities. Some of the benefits included in our daily fee are: 


· | NURSING - licensed nursing staff under the supervision of an RN for better care of chronic diseases
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | FOOD - delicious catered meals with special diets accommodated 
· | ACTIVITIES - customized to your loved one’s interests and abilities 
· | SOCIALIZATION - be with friends, remain active, and enjoy the day 

Nursing Services - While our participants enjoy their day at SarahCare, our center nurses provide the care and monitoring they need on a regular basis. Care is provided in the privacy of our nurse’s clinic. Our centers are staffed with the qualified Registered and/or Licensed nurses. They are often specially certified and trained to work with issues related to aging and the elderly, and are passionate about caring for seniors. Nursing services that are offered include:

· | Medication administration and oversight 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Weight and vital signs monitored and recorded regularly 
· | Diabetic care 
· | Care of feeding tubes and ostomies 
· | Dressing changes 
· | Other services needed by you or your loved one or as ordered by a physician

Meals – We offer delicious and nutritious meals at no extra cost. Meals are the perfect time for friends to socialize and celebrate, sharing memories and exchanging jokes. Our beautiful dining rooms and delicious food help turn each meal into a special event. A light breakfast, a delicious catered lunch, and afternoon snack are all included in the daily rate. Special diets are easily accommodated and assistance at meal time is always available.
Intergenerational - Our intergenerational program brings together seniors and children in a safe and engaging environment. ‘Grandparents’ and ‘grandchildren’ have so much to share and can be a great source of joy to each other, yet they rarely have these opportunities. SarahCare intergenerational programs bring both generations together in a structured environment where they can learn from each other – sharing their feelings, ideas, skills, and affection. Unlike other informal and casual get-togethers, our intergenerational program was scientifically designed and researched to encourage these interactions and allow our seniors to participate fully – from disabled and frail elders to sufferers of dementia and Parkinson’s.
Customized Programs - Home Care - A participant’s time with SarahCare’s specially-trained staff doesn’t have to stop at the end of the day. Some seniors who are still living independently at home may require assistance during evenings and weekends, when they can’t spend time at the center. Or, if a loved one resides with their family, occurrences may come up that require the family to be away from home during an evening or weekend when your senior requires care. 
Franchisees - Our franchisees pay us a variety of royalties and fees. Typical locations are commercial or professional office locations convenient to working caregivers. The approximate size of a SARAH Business facility is 5,000-6,000 square feet. Rent is estimated to be $96,000-$140,000 annually depending on size, condition and location of leased premises. 
State and Federal Licenses. Both the company owned centers and the franchise centers acquire the required licenses prior to opening in their respective states. Not all states, such as Ohio, require a license to operate an ADHC (Adult Day Health Center), while other states, such as Pennsylvania, have strict licensing regulations. If a center wants to accept Medicaid participants, then they must complete the Medicaid certification process. The VA (Veterans Affairs) has their own standards and survey process in order to obtain an agreement/contract with the VA. All of these programs are administered by individual states. Every center follows the regulations as interpreted by the VA center in the specific area in which their center is located. 

The federal program the Child Adult Food Care Program (CACFP) is for the reimbursement of food, and is administered by the Department of Agriculture. If a center wants to utilize CACFP, then they must complete the Department of Agriculture’s application and survey process. 

All centers are surveyed annually by their state licensing department (if applicable), Medicaid, the VA, the CACFP (if applicable) and any additional funding source they may be using. In addition, most centers are surveyed by their local Health and Fire Departments annually.

Goods and Services One Must Acquire From An Approved Supplier Or In Accordance With Our Standards and Specifications 

The trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos must be properly depicted on any brochures, business cards and stationery, signage, forms, and public relations materials you purchase for use in your operation of the SARAH Business. These items, and other products, supply items and services, may be purchased from any source; however, we retain the right to, at any time in the future, condition the right to buy or lease goods and/or services on their meeting minimum standards and specifications and/or being acquired from suppliers we specifically designate or approve. We may issue and modify standards from time to time and enumerate them in our Operations Manual or other communications. 

A Franchisee must purchase software to be used in the operation of the SARAH Business from a designated supplier. They may acquire certain pre-approved social media channels and online content for the SARAH Business only through us or our designated supplier. (Currently our System standards include Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn and no other channels, as approved social media outlets through which SARAH Businesses may be promoted.) A Franchisee must use the e-mail accounts we provide to you. We also currently recommend that they use our approved suppliers for: real estate site selection services; furniture, fixtures and equipment; marketing materials; computer software, and printing services. Otherwise, there currently are no goods, services, supplies, fixtures, equipment, inventory, computer hardware, real estate, or comparable items related to establishing or operating the SARAH Business that you must buy from us, our affiliate, or an approved supplier. None of our officers currently owns an interest in any supplier to SARAH Businesses. 

If a Franchisee wants to purchase or lease any product, supply, item or service from a supplier or provider that we have not already approved, they must first obtain our approval. They may request our approval by providing us with a sample of the item they would like us to approve. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Franchisee within 30 days after receiving all samples and any other requested information or specifications, whether they are authorized to purchase or lease the product or service from that supplier or provider. We do not charge a fee for engaging in this approval process. 

In the event we receive rebates from any suppliers to our franchisees, these funds will be used for marketing and promotional purposes. We estimate that, collectively, the purchases and leases you obtain according to our specifications or from approved or designated suppliers represent between 2.5%-7.5% of your total purchases and leases in connection with the establishment and operation of the SARAH Business. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we did not receive any rebates or other payments from suppliers based on their sales to franchisees and neither we nor our affiliates sold or leased any products or services to franchisees. 

Insurance

Besides these purchases or leases, a potential Franchisee must obtain and maintain, at their own expense, the insurance coverage that we periodically require and satisfy other insurance-related obligations. They currently must obtain the following insurance: (i) comprehensive commercial general liability insurance, including bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, products and completed operations liability coverage with a combined single limit of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injuries, $1,000,000 per occurrence for property damage and $2,000,000 annual aggregate, (ii) workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance to meet statutory requirements of that of operation where the SARAH Business is located; (iii) commercial property insurance at replacement value, including fire, vandalism, and extended coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full replacement value of the SARAH Business and its furniture, fixtures and equipment; (iv) automobile liability insurance for all owned, non-owned and hired automobiles with a single coverage limit of not less than $1,000,000; (v) other insurance as may be required by the state or locality in which the SARAH Business is located and operated; and (vi) professional liability insurance of not less than $1,000,000. All of the policies they maintain must contain the minimum coverage described above and must have deductibles not to exceed the amounts we specify. Each of the insurance policies must be issued by an insurance company of recognized responsibility and satisfactory to us. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under these insurance policies and/or require different or additional insurance coverages at any time. The commercial general liability, automobile, and umbrella insurance policies must list us as additional insured parties and provide for 30 days’ prior written notice to us in the event of a policy’s material modification, cancellation, or expiration. They must furnish us with a copy of your Certificate of Insurance within 10 business days upon receipt of your Occupancy Permit for the SARAH Business. If they fail or refuse to obtain or maintain the insurance we specify, in addition to our other remedies including termination, we may obtain such insurance for you and the SARAH Business, on the potential Franchisee’s behalf, in which event they must cooperate with us and reimburse us for all premiums, costs and expenses we incur in obtaining and maintaining the insurance, plus a reasonable fee for our time incurred in obtaining such insurance.

Advertising Materials 

Before a potential Franchisee uses them, they must send to us for review samples of all advertising, promotional and marketing materials which we have not prepared or previously approved. They must not use any advertising, promotional, or marketing materials that we have not approved or have disapproved. During approximately the first 3 months of operating the SARAH Business, we will use the Marketing Deposit to pay vendors selected to provide advertising and related services for the promotion of the SARAH Business, which may include, for example, arranging online Internet advertising and marketing content, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn or other social media outlets and paying click-through charges to search engines, banner advertising sources, and advertising host sites to promote the SARAH Business. We may develop certain promotional materials and/or designate or approve specific suppliers of promotional materials during the franchise term that we may require them to purchase and use. All online marketing activities you conduct for the SARAH Business must meet our then-current guidelines for franchisee use of social media that we include as part of the Operations Manual or otherwise communicate as part of our System standards. 

Development of Your SARAH Business 

A potential Franchisee is responsible for locating, obtaining, and developing a site for the SARAH Business within the Territory. They must submit a proposed site for the SARAH Business for our approval in a form we specify that includes detailed construction drawings and other site-specific information. After we approve a site for the SARAH Business, they are responsible for constructing and equipping the SARAH Business at that site. They may not begin developing any site or constructing or remodeling any structures or fixtures before we have approved the site. They may consult with real estate and other professionals of their choosing, and we may also assist you in the development of the SARAH Business. They must submit to us for our approval detailed plans and specifications adopting our then-current plans and specifications for SARAH Businesses. 

SarahCare, as the franchisor, supplies the Franchisee’s with initial assistance and approval with the following: 


1. | Give you our site selection criteria for the SARAH Business and, upon a potential Franchisee’s request, provide input regarding possible sites. We do not own and lease any site to franchisees. After they select and we approve a site, we will designate the geographic area within which they may establish the SARAH Business.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Approve the signage. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | Identify the standards and specifications for products, services, and materials that comply with the System, and, if we require, the approved suppliers of these items. We will furnish a potential Franchisee with the listing of the package of initial franchise items as detailed in the Operations Manual. Neither we nor our affiliate provide, deliver, or install any of these items.
4. | Provide an Initial Training Program. 
5. | Provide an Operations Training Program. 


Once the Franchisee’s SarahCare business is operational, we will:


1. | Issue and modify System standards for SARAH Businesses. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Provide access to a copy of our Operations Manual as we make available through our intranet. The Operations Manual contains mandatory and suggested specifications, standards and operating procedure.
3. | Give you additional or special guidance and assistance and training as we deem appropriate and for which a potential Franchisee are financially responsible. 
4. | Inspect and observe the operation of the SARAH Business to help a potential Franchisee comply with the Franchise Agreement and all System standards. 
5. | Let you use the confidential information. 
6. | Let you use the Marks. 


9

Opening 

We estimate that a potential Franchisee will open the SARAH Business within 8 to 10 months after they sign the Franchise Agreement. The interval between signing the Franchise Agreement and opening the SARAH Business depends on the site’s location and condition, the construction schedule for the SARAH Business, the extent to which they must upgrade or remodel an existing location, the delivery schedule for equipment and supplies, securing financing arrangements, completing training, and complying with local laws and regulations.

Our Growth Strategy

Our sales and marketing teams intend to leverage our value proposition and strong participant satisfaction to promote our brand and attract new participants to our centers. The size of our centers depends on the size of the addressable population within each service area. We first determine whether we can fill a center’s expected participant census, then, as a center reaches its initial capacity, we plan to increase its size through pre-planned facility expansions. Once we have reached planned capacity, we intend to expand to other locations.

Our growth strategy includes renewing our current franchised locations. Recently, SarahCare renewed its agreements regarding two SarahCare franchised locations, one in The Woodlands, Texas, and one in Kingwood, Texas. Both renewals are for five years.

Leasing New Market Space

We plan to build new centers or lease from existing market space to enter new markets for our daycare centers into adjacent or new geographies. 

The placement of our centers in attractive locations is critical to our success. We regularly conduct zip code level analyses and convene small focus groups with potential participants and caregivers to identify service areas with attractive concentrations of seniors eligible for our daycare services and select optimal sites for our centers. We prioritize service areas with populations that include more than 4,000 potential participants within a 60-minute drive of a center. Our approach to building new daycare centers or leasing space in favorable market areas is based on our experience-based specifications, with flexibility for future center expansion factored into the blueprints where possible.

On April 21, 2021, the Company, through ten newly-formed, wholly-owned limited liability companies, entered into lease agreements with entities controlled by our Chairman, Charles Everhardt, for ten additional SarahCare locations to be operated by the Company. All of the leases are for a ten-year period beginning on July 1, 2021, and ending on June 30, 2031, with a 5-year renewal option. The rent for each location is $7,500 per month. As of June 30, 2021, the Company amended the leases to delay commencement until November 1, 2021.As of November 1, 2021, the Company amended the leases to delay commencement until May 1, 2022. As of April 30, 2022, the Company amended the leases to delay commencement until November 1, 2022. On August 19, 2022, the Company and landlord mutually agreed to terminate the Austin lease.

The nine locations are as follows:

Texas – 9090 Southwest Freeway, Houston, TX 77074 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.
Ohio – 33 East 5th Street, Dayton, OH 45402 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.
Mississippi – 200 E Amite Street, Jackson, MS 39201 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.
Georgia – 1775 Parkway Place SE, Marietta, GA 30067 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.
Tennessee – 2625 Thousand Oaks, Memphis, TN 38118 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.
Florida – 3835 McCoy Road, Orlando, FL 32812 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.
Pennsylvania – 1741 Papermill Road, Wyomissing, PA 19610 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.

Oklahoma – 7902 South Lewis Avenue, Tulsa, OK 74136 – approximately 8,500 sq. ft.

Potential Acquisitions

We believe we are the logical acquiror in a fragmented market made up of mostly small independent local operators. We are looking for potential acquisitions in new geographic markets along with existing markets that meet certain criteria. We maintain discipline in our approach in regards to purchase price for acquisitions. We consider many factors in determining the purchase price that include potential market expansion, healthcare employee base, demographics of our target market of seniors, daycare demand both future and present is also considered along with other factors before a decision is made to acquire a potential acquisition target. We work closely with key constituencies, including local governments, health systems and senior housing providers, to ensure participants continue to receive the high quality care we demand in our operations and that potential acquisition targets can achieve our important quality standards.

Reinvest in our Technology

We are continuing to examine ways to improve and enhance our technology offerings to improve efficiencies in our operations. Further, we are evaluating new software and medical device technology to use at our centers to help with our participants who are experiencing chronic conditions. We believe placing new technologies at our centers to further meet the needs of our participants will help us to stand out in the daycare market and attract further participants to our centers. As we continue to evaluate new ways of bringing new technologies and efficiencies to our operations, we believe we will be able to attract new participants and potentially reduce medical costs. 

Industry Overview 

Healthcare spending in the United States has grown at approximately 5% per year from 2013 to 2018, and in 2018 represented $3.6 trillion of annual spend, or 17.7% of U.S. GDP. The overall growth rate of healthcare spending is expected to accelerate due to the aging population. Furthermore, the government’s share of total healthcare spend through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid is expected to grow from approximately 37% today to more than 40% as early as 2025, indicating faster growth in government-sponsored healthcare than the overall market. There are approximately 6,000 senior daycare centers across the United States. The industry market size is approximately $6.4 billion and expected to rise 25% over the next five years. Each senior daycare center has an average of 60 participants with daily participants of 351,900 using senior daycare services.

Employees

As of June 30, 2022, the Company had 40 employees. This does not include the employees of the independently owned and run franchise locations.

Intellectual Property

Competition

There are approximately 4,600 adult day care centers (from the CDC) in the U.S. may be part of stand-alone adult centers specifically set up to provide day care to seniors, 70 percent are affiliated with or operate within senior centers, churches, medical centers or residential care facilities. Two of our larger competitors include Active Day, with approximately 100 locations, and Easter Seals, a non-profit with 69 affiliates. Programs run from several hours to a full day. Participants may attend daily, a few times a week, weekly, or just for special activities. Weekend and evening care are less common, although this is changing as demand for adult day care rises. We also compete with home care and in-home medical care professionals and enterprises. 
Governmental Regulations

We will be governed by government laws and regulations governing adult day care facilities. We believe that we are currently in compliance with all laws which govern our operations and have no current liabilities thereunder. Our intent is to maintain strict compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations.
Reports to Security Holders

We intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s operations.
