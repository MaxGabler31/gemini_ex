Item 1.     Business.
Our Company
          We are a Midland, Texas‑based oilfield services company providing hydraulic fracturing and other complementary services to leading upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration and production ("E&P") of North American oil and natural gas resources. Our operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin, where we have cultivated longstanding customer relationships with some of the region’s most active and well‑capitalized E&P companies. The Permian Basin is widely regarded as one of the most prolific oil‑producing areas in the United States, and we believe we are one of the leading providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the region by hydraulic horsepower ("HHP"). 
       Our total available HHP at December 31, 2021 was 1,423,000 HHP, which was comprised of 90,000 HHP of our Tier IV Dynamic Gas Blending ("DGB") equipment, 1,225,000 HHP of conventional Tier II equipment and 108,000 HHP of our DuraStim® electric hydraulic fracturing equipment. Our fleet could range from approximately 50,000 to 80,000 HHP depending on the job design and customer demand at the wellsites. With the industry transition to lower emissions equipment and simultaneous hydraulic fracturing ("Simul-Frac"), in addition to several other changes to our customers' job designs, we believe that our available fleet capacity could decline if we decide to reconfigure our fleets to increase active HHP and backup HHP at the wellsites. In September 2021, we placed an order with our equipment manufacturers for 125,000 HHP of Tier IV DGB equipment for additional conversions, which we expect to be delivered at different times through the first half of 2022. 
          In 2019, we entered into a purchase commitment for 108,000 HHP of DuraStim® electric powered hydraulic fracturing equipment. In addition to DuraStim® fleets, we are also evaluating other electric and alternative pressure pumping solutions. In December 2021, we disposed of our two gas turbines initially purchased to provide electrical power to our DuraStim® fleets as we determined they were an inefficient power solution in the field. In the future, we may lease electrical power equipment from a third party or rely on our customers to provide power solutions for our electric equipment.
          Our competitors include many large and small oilfield services companies, including Halliburton Company, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., Nextier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., RPC, Inc., FTS International Inc. and a number of private and locally-oriented businesses. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, an oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies at competitive prices. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation, technical expertise, emissions profile, service and equipment design and quality, and health and safety standards. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, we believe price is a key factor in E&P companies' criteria in choosing a service provider. However, we have recently observed the energy industry and our customers shift to lower emissions equipment, which we believe will be an increasingly important factor in an E&P company's selection of a service provider. The transition to lower emissions equipment has been challenging for companies in the service industry because of the capital requirements, and the depressed pricing experienced by the service industry. While we seek to price our services competitively, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our operational efficiencies, productivity, equipment quality, reliability, ability to manage multifaceted logistics challenges, commitment to safety and the ability of our people to handle the most complex Permian Basin well completions.
          Our substantial market presence in the Permian Basin positions us well to capitalize on drilling and completion activity in the region. Primarily, our operational focus has been in the Permian Basin's Midland sub-basin, where our customers have operated. However, we have recently increased our operations in the Delaware sub-basin and are well-positioned to support further increases to our activity in this area in response to demand from our customers. Over time, we expect the Permian Basin's Midland and Delaware sub-basins to continue to command a disproportionate share of future North American E&P spending.
Through our pressure pumping segment (which also includes our cementing operations), we primarily provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies in the Permian Basin. Our hydraulic fracturing fleet has been designed to handle the operating conditions commonly utilized in the Permian Basin and the region's increasingly high-intensity well completions (including Simul-Frac, which involves fracturing multiple wellbores at the same time), which are characterized by longer horizontal wellbores, more stages per lateral and increasing amounts of proppant per well.

          In addition to our core pressure pumping segment operations, which includes our cementing operations, we also offer coiled tubing services. Through our coiled tubing services segment, we seek to create operational efficiencies for our customers, which could allow us to capture a greater portion of their capital spending across the lifecycle of a well.
Commodity Price and Other Economic Conditions
         The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including domestic and international supply and demand for oil and gas, current and expected future prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, and capital investments of E&P companies toward their development and production of oil and gas reserves. The oil and gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions such as supply chain disruptions and inflation, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and internationally), levels of consumer demand, adverse weather conditions, and other factors that are beyond our control. 
         The global public health crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse effect on global economic activity for the foreseeable future. Some of the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that have impacted our business include restrictions on movement of personnel and associated gatherings, shortage of skilled labor, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, with most of the large, capitalized E&P companies in the United States, including our customers, closely managing their operating budget and exercising capital discipline, we do not currently expect significant increases in crude oil production over the short-to-medium term. Furthermore, OPEC+ has indicated that they will continue with their plans to manage production levels by gradually increasing crude oil output. With the tightness in crude oil production and growing demand for crude oil, there has been a significant increase in rig count and WTI crude oil prices have increased to over $90 per barrel in February 2022 from its lowest point of $20 per barrel in March 2020. The Permian Basin rig count has increased significantly from approximately 179 at the beginning of 2021 to approximately 294 at the end of 2021, according to Baker Hughes. Although crude oil prices are currently at a 7-year high, the oilfield services industry, including the pressure pumping segment, has not fully recovered as evidenced by continued depressed pricing for most of our services, and shortages of skilled labor force in the Permian Basin, coupled with rising inflationary costs. However, we still believe that the Permian Basin, our primary area of operation, will be the most attractive basin to E&P companies and should command higher prices and associated profitability, if the overall demand for crude oil and our services continues to increase. 
          Government regulations and investors are demanding the oil and gas industry transition to a lower emissions operating environment, including the upstream and oilfield services companies. As a result, we are working with our customers and equipment manufacturers to transition to a lower emissions profile. Currently, a number of lower emission solutions for pumping equipment, including Tier IV DGB, electric, direct drive gas turbine and other technologies have been developed, and we expect additional lower emission solutions will be developed in the future. We are continually evaluating these technologies and other investment and acquisition opportunities that would support our existing and new customer relationships. The transition to lower emissions equipment is quickly evolving and will be capital intensive. Over time, we may be required to convert substantially all of our conventional Tier II equipment to lower emissions equipment. If we are unable to quickly transition to lower emissions equipment and meet our and our customers’ emissions goals, the demand for our services could be adversely impacted.
          The Permian Basin rig count increase, WTI crude oil price increase and costs inflation could be indicative of an energy market recovery. If the rig count and market conditions continue to improve, including improved customers' pricing and labor availability, and we are able to meet our customers' lower emissions equipment demands, we believe our operational and financial results will also continue to improve. However, if market conditions do not improve, and we are unable to increase our pricing or pass-through future cost increases to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more discussions on our current and future business environment and financial performance. 
Our Services
          We have historically conducted our business through three operating segments: hydraulic fracturing, cementing, and coiled tubing. For reporting purposes, the hydraulic fracturing and cementing operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment—"Pressure Pumping". Our coiled tubing operating segment and corporate administrative expense are aggregated into our "All Other" segment. For additional financial information on our reportable segments, please see reportable segment information in Part II - Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Pressure Pumping
Hydraulic Fracturing
          We primarily provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies in the Permian Basin. These services are intended to optimize hydrocarbon flow paths during the completion phase of horizontal shale wellbores. We have significant expertise in multi‑stage fracturing of horizontal oil‑producing wells in unconventional geological formations. Our total available HHP at December 31, 2021 was 1,423,000 HHP, which was comprised of 90,000 HHP of our Tier IV DGB equipment, 1,225,000 HHP of conventional Tier II equipment and 108,000 HHP of our DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing equipment. Our DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing equipment has been tested on a limited scale basis with certain of our customers and we are evaluating the appropriate strategy to continue such field testing, including whether field testing will be conducted in 2022.
          The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. Materials known as proppants, which in our business are comprised primarily of sand, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. The fracturing fluid is designed to break, or loosen viscosity, and be forced out of the formation by its pressure, leaving the proppants suspended in the fractures created, thereby increasing the mobility of the hydrocarbons. As a result of the fracturing process, production rates are usually enhanced substantially, thus increasing the rate of return of hydrocarbons for the operator.
          We own and operate a fleet of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary equipment to perform fracturing services. We also refer to all of our fracturing units, other equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a fracturing job as a "fleet" and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a "crew." On average, one hydraulic fracturing fleet consists of approximately 50,000 to 80,000 HHP, depending on job design and customer demand. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of a high pressure hydraulic pump, diesel or dual gas engine, transmission and various hoses, valves, tanks and other supporting equipment like blenders, irons, hoses and datavans. Our DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing fleet is electrically driven and can be powered by turbines, generators or similar equipment that can generate electricity. In December 2021, we sold our two turbines for cash consideration of $36.0 million, and the net book value of the turbines prior to the sale was approximately $39.5 million. Our two turbines were initially purchased to provide power to our DuraStim® equipment. In the future, we may lease or purchase alternative power solutions for our electric equipment.
          We provide dedicated equipment, personnel and services that are tailored to meet each of our customer’s needs. Each fleet has a designated team of personnel, which allows us to provide responsive and customized services, such as project design, proppant and other consumables procurement, real‑time data provision and post‑completion analysis for each of our jobs. Many of our hydraulic fracturing fleets and associated personnel have worked continuously with the same customer for the past several years promoting deep relationships and a high degree of coordination and visibility into future customer activity levels. Furthermore, in light of our substantial market presence and historically high fleet utilization levels, we have established a variety of trusted relationships with key equipment, sand and other downhole consumable suppliers. We believe these strategic relationships position us to acquire equipment, parts and materials on a timely and economic basis and allow our dedicated procurement and logistics team to support consistently safe and reliable operations.
Cementing
          We provide cementing services for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. Cementing services use pressure pumping equipment to deliver a slurry of liquid cement that is pumped down a well between the casing and the borehole. Cementing provides isolation between fluid zones behind the casing to minimize potential damage to hydrocarbon bearing formations or the integrity of freshwater aquifers, and provides structural integrity for the casing by securing it to the earth. Cementing is also done when re-completing wells, where one zone is plugged and another is opened.
        We believe that our cementing segment provides an organic growth opportunity for us to expand our service offerings within our existing customer base.

Other Services
Coiled Tubing
          Coiled tubing services involve injecting coiled tubing into wells to perform various completion well intervention operations. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of typically less than three inches and manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet. It is wound or coiled on a truck‑mounted reel for onshore applications. Due to its small diameter, coiled tubing can be inserted into existing production tubing and used to perform a variety of services (including drillout of plugs) to enhance the flow of oil or natural gas.
          The principal advantages of using coiled tubing include the ability to (i) continue production from the well without interruption, thus reducing the risk of formation damage, (ii) move continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe used with a workover rig, which must be jointed and unjointed, (iii) direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, allowing for improved stimulation fluid placement, (iv) provide a source of energy to power a downhole motor or manipulate downhole tools, and (v) enhance access to remote fields due to the smaller size and mobility.
Our Customers
          Our customers consist primarily of oil and natural gas producers in North America. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 85.7%, 86.5% and 77.1% of our revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Pioneer Natural Resources USA Inc. ("Pioneer") and Endeavor Energy Resources accounted for 54.2% and 14.6%, respectively, of total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Competition
          The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, an oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies at competitive prices. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation, technical expertise, emissions profile, service and equipment design and quality, and health and safety standards. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, we believe price is a key factor in E&P companies’ criteria in choosing a service provider. However, we have recently observed the energy industry and our customers shift to lower emissions equipment, which we believe will be an increasingly important factor in an E&P company’s selection of a service provider. The transition to lower emissions equipment has been challenging for companies in the oilfield service industry because of the capital requirements and the continuing depressed pricing experienced by the service industry. While we seek to price our services competitively, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our operational efficiencies, productivity, equipment quality, reliability, ability to manage multifaceted logistics challenges, commitment to safety and the ability of our people to handle the most complex Permian Basin well completions.
          We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield services companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies. Our major competitors for hydraulic fracturing services include Halliburton Company, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., Nextier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Patterson‑UTI Energy Inc., RPC, Inc., FTS International, Inc. and a number of private and locally-oriented businesses.
Seasonality
          Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, generally in the fourth quarter, relating to the conclusion of our customers’ annual capital expenditure budgets, the holidays and inclement winter weather during which we may experience declines in our operating results.
Operating Risks and Insurance
          Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment and suspension of operations.
4 


          In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
          Our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, and as a result, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury.
          Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we have suffered accidents from time to time in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
          We maintain commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business automobile, commercial property, umbrella liability, excess liability, and directors and officers insurance policies providing coverages of risks and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry. Further, we have pollution legal liability coverage for our business entities, which would cover, among other things, third party liability and costs of clean up relating to environmental contamination on our premises while our equipment is in transit and on our customers’ job site. With respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations, coverage would be available under our pollution legal liability policy for any surface or subsurface environmental clean‑up and liability to third parties arising from any surface or subsurface contamination. We also have certain specific coverages for some of our businesses, including our hydraulic fracturing services.
          We maintain directors and officers insurance; however, our insurance coverage is subject to certain exclusions (including, for example, any required SEC disgorgement or penalties) and we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us from claims made in the Logan Lawsuit or any future claims.
          Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. See “Risk Factors” for a description of certain risks associated with our insurance policies.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
          Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that could carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may, for example, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, or require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position. For example, following the election of President Biden and Democratic control in both houses of Congress, it is possible that our operations may be subject to greater environmental, health and safety restrictions, particularly with regards to hydraulic fracturing, permitting and greenhouse gases ("GHG") emissions. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with current requirements; however, this trend may not continue in the future.
          Below is an overview of some of the more significant environmental, health and safety requirements with which we must comply. Our customers’ operations are subject to similar laws and regulations. Any material adverse effect of these laws and regulations on our customers’ operations and financial position may also have an indirect material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
5 


          Waste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state laws and regulations, which affect our activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions.
          Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or recategorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
          Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes or contamination, damages to natural resources, the costs of conducting certain health studies, amongst other things, is strict and joint and several. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state laws. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been released.
          NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials ("NORM") associated with oil and gas deposits and, accordingly, may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.
          Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters.
          Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act ("CAA") and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other emissions control requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate. Obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
          Climate Change. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of certain pollutants from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the Department of Transportation ("DOT"), implementing GHG emissions limits on 
6 


vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. In September 2020, the Trump Administration revised prior regulations to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, subsequently, the U.S. Congress approved, and President Biden signed into law, a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the September 2020 revisions to the methane standards, effectively reinstating the prior standards. Additionally in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish OOOO(b) new source and OOOO(c) first-time existing source of standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions for oil and gas facilities. Operators of affected facilities will have to comply with specific standards of performance to include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair equipment, and reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal in 2022 containing additional requirements not included in the November 2021 proposed rule and anticipates the issuance of a final rule by the end of the year.
          Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas such as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored "Paris Agreement," requires member states to submit non-binding, individually-determined reduction goals known as Nationally Determined Contributions (“NDCs”) every five years after 2020. Following President Biden’s executive order in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, established a goal of reducing economy-wide net GHG emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Additionally, at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”) in Glasgow in November 2021, the United States and the European Union jointly announced the launch of the Global Methane Pledge; an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. However, the impacts of these actions are unclear at this time. 
          Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate-change-related pledges made by certain candidates for public office. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across government agencies and economic sectors. The executive order also suspends the issuance of new leases for oil and gas development on federal land; for more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled "Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities." Other actions that the Biden Administration may take include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the development of pipeline infrastructure or liquefied natural gas export facilities or more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of parties have sought to bring suit against certain oil and natural gas companies operating in the United States in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or that such companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change but failed to adequately disclose those impacts to their investors or customers.
          The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products.
          Moreover, climate change may result in various physical risks, such as the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in the meteorological and hydrological patterns, that could adversely impact us, our customers’ and our suppliers’ operations. Such physical risks may result in damage to our customers’ facilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations, such as if facilities are subject to water use curtailments in response to drought, or demand for our customers’ products, such as to the extent warmer winters reduce the demand for energy for heating purposes, which may ultimately reduce demand for the products and services we provide. Such physical risks may also impact our suppliers, which may adversely affect out ability to provide our products and services. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
          Endangered and Threatened Species. Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act ("ESA") and analogous state laws may impact exploration, development and production activities in areas where we operate. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and various state analogs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("FWS") may identify previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate 
7 


critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. For example, the dunes sagebrush lizard, which is found only in the active and semi-stable shinnery oak dunes of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas (including areas where our customers operate), was a candidate species for listing under the ESA by the FWS for many years. As a result of a recent settlement with certain environmental groups, the FWS, in July 2020, acted on a petition to list the dunes sagebrush lizard finding sufficient information to warrant a formal one-year review to consider listing the species. While that deadline has been missed, the listing review is reportedly ongoing; additionally, FWS has also solicited comments on a proposed conservation agreement that would implement certain protective practices for the species and authorize incidental take of the species resulting from certain covered activities, including exploration and development of oil and gas fields. However, to the extent any protections are implemented for this or any other species, it could cause us or our customers to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or operating bans in the affected areas.
          Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Our hydraulic fracturing operations are a significant component of our business. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has previously issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and associated equipment. Separately, the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") previously finalized a rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, but that rule was subsequently rescinded. Although several of these rulemakings have been rescinded, modified or subjected to legal challenges, new or more stringent regulations may be promulgated by the Biden administration. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order suspending new leasing activities, but not operations under existing leases, for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. Although the federal court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction against the leasing pause, in response to the executive order, the Department of the Interior ("DOI") issued a report recommending various changes to the federal leasing program, though many such changes would require Congressional action. As a result, we cannot predict the final scope of regulations or restrictions that may apply to oil and gas operations on federal lands. However, any regulations that ban or effectively ban such operations may adversely impact demand for our products and services. Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have previously been proposed in Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
          Federal and state governments have also investigated whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that impose permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In particular, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK require hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. In addition, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has previously issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. The Texas Railroad Commission ("TRRC") has adopted similar rules and, in September 2021, issued a notice to disposal well operators in the Gardendale Seismic Response Area near Midland, Texas to reduce daily injection volumes following multiple earthquakes above a 3.5 magnitude over an 18 month period. The notice also required disposal well operators to provide injection data to TRRC staff to further analyze seismicity in the area. Subsequently, the TRRC ordered the indefinite suspension of all deep oil and gas produced water injection wells in the area, effective December 31, 2021. While we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, any action that temporarily or permanently restricts the availability of disposal capacity for produced water or other oilfield fluids may increase our customers’ costs or require them to suspend operations, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.

          Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities could subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and record keeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers, and reduce the demand for our services.
          OSHA Matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
Human Capital
          Our employees are our key asset. Our primary human capital management objectives are to effectively engage, develop, retain and reward our employees. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,500 people, none of which are unionized. Of the total population over 80% of our headcount worked for or supports our pressure pumping segment. Our employees are a key component of our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of their operational excellence in the field.
         Some examples of significant programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:
•Diversity and inclusion. We believe that in order to attract and retain talent with the skill sets and expertise required to maximize our operational efficiencies across all levels in the Company, it is in our best interest to attempt to recruit and develop a diverse team and create a culture that is inclusive and provides equal opportunities for hiring and advancement for all employees and prospective employees. Some examples of this effort include;
◦a commitment to conducting business in a manner that respects all human rights in compliance within the requirements of applicable laws;
◦efforts to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinctions of any kind such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions;
◦working in partnership with personnel, business parties and other parties directly linked to our operations that share our commitment to these same principles;
◦efforts in our employment practices, including through our code of conduct, our equal employment opportunity employer policy, and our anti-harassment policy; and
◦to make it possible for grievances regarding health and safety to be addressed early and remediated directly, in confidence and without fear of retaliation; the Company provides an anonymous Ethics and Compliance hotline that is promoted internally and accessible from our intranet and internet.
•Training and Safety.  We offer in-depth, role-appropriate safety training upon hiring and as part of the continuous development of our employees. The safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate is paramount. We track and evaluate safety incidents at wellsites and offices, and if an accident does occur, we take actions to mitigate similar incidents from reoccurring in the future. The Company incentivizes employees to focus on conducting operations in accordance with our strict safety standards and encourages employees to immediately report any breach of safety protocol. Ten percent of our executive officers’ annual target bonuses under the 2021 annual incentive program were based upon the Company’s achievement of certain safety goals, including a target total recordable incident rate of less than 0.75.
•Professional Development. In 2021 ProPetro introduced a Tuition Reimbursement Program to encourage employees to pursue professional development interests that will help strengthen skills and competencies required for their current position or future roles in the business. This program is designed to provide assistance and offset related training expense.

•Health, Wellness and Benefits. Our employee benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce across the Company and we believe are consistent with those provided by our peer companies with which we compete for talent. The Company provides employees with the ability to participate in health and welfare plans, including medical, dental, life, accidental death and dismemberment and short-term and long-term disability insurance plans. Since the beginning of COVID-19, we have implemented processes and procedures to help address COVID-19 matters. Below are some of the adjustments we made to address the COVID-19 pandemic;
◦instituted periodic update, guidelines and questionnaires to all employees to address and identify COVID-19 related matters;
◦initially instituted a temporary remote work environment in response to COVID-19 and have retained the flexibility for employees to work remotely when necessary or advisable;
◦encouraged all employees to adhere to guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and
◦provided coverage for COVID-19 testing and vaccination under the Company’s medical plan at no cost to our employees.
         In 2021, we performed an extensive review of our health-related benefits program to ensure that our offerings are market competitive and effectively utilized by employees. Based on that review, we made comprehensive adjustments to our health-related benefits programs, which improved the cost and quality of coverage. We significantly increased the number of employee meetings to provide education and encourage individuals to maximize the value of benefits offered, resulting in an overall increase in participation and positive feedback from employees.
         We have also recently initiated a plan to review our 401(k) plan and implement improvements in 2022 with a focus on improving plan structure, reducing program administration, providing employee education and increasing plan participation.
