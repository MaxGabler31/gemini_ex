ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Avista Corp., incorporated in the territory of Washington in 1889, is primarily an electric and natural gas utility with certain other business ventures. As of December 31, 2017, we employed 1,744 people in our Pacific Northwest utility operations (Avista Utilities) and 204 people in our subsidiary businesses (including our Juneau, Alaska utility operations). Our corporate headquarters are in Spokane, Washington, the second-largest city in Washington. Spokane serves as the business, transportation, medical, industrial and cultural hub of the Inland Northwest region (eastern Washington and northern Idaho). Regional services include government and higher education, medical services, retail trade and finance. Through our subsidiary AEL&P, we also provide electric utility services in Juneau, Alaska.
As of December 31, 2017, we have two reportable business segments as follows:

• | Avista Utilities – an operating division of Avista Corp., comprising the regulated utility operations in the Pacific Northwest. Avista Utilities provides electric distribution and transmission, and natural gas distribution services in parts of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. Avista Utilities also provides natural gas distribution service in parts of northeastern and southwestern Oregon. Avista Utilities has electric generating facilities in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Montana. Avista Utilities also supplies electricity to a small number of customers in Montana, most of whom are employees who operate Avista Utilities' Noxon Rapids generating facility. Avista Utilities also engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas as an integral part of energy resource management and its load-serving obligation.


• | AEL&P - a utility providing electric services in Juneau, Alaska that is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the primary operating subsidiary of AERC.

We have other businesses, including sheet metal fabrication, venture fund investments, real estate investments, as well as certain other investments of Avista Capital, which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Avista Corp. These activities do not represent a reportable business segment and are conducted by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of Avista Corp.
Total Avista Corp. shareholders’ equity was $1,729.8 million as of December 31, 2017, of which $52.6 million represented our investment in Avista Capital and $108.6 million represented our investment in AERC.
See “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and “Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information with respect to the operating performance of each business segment (and other subsidiaries).

AVISTA CORPORATION

Electric Operations
General Avista Utilities generates, transmits and distributes electricity, serving electric customers in eastern Washington, northern Idaho and a small number of customers in Montana. 
Avista Utilities generates electricity from facilities that we own and purchases capacity, energy and fuel for generation under long-term and short-term contracts to meet customer load obligations. We also sell electric capacity and energy, as well as surplus fuel in the wholesale market in connection with our resource optimization activities as described below.
As part of Avista Utilities' resource procurement and management operations in the electric business, we engage in an ongoing process of resource optimization, which involves the economic selection of energy resources from those available to serve our load obligations and the capture of additional economic value through wholesale market transactions. These transactions include sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, fuel for electric generation, and derivative instruments related to capacity, energy, fuel and fuel transportation. Such transactions are part of the process of matching available resources with load obligations and hedging the related financial risks. In order to implement this process, we make continuing projections of:

• | electric loads at various points in time (ranging from intra-hour to multiple years) based on, among other things, estimates of customer usage and weather, historical data and contract terms, and


• | resource availability at these points in time based on, among other things, fuel choices and fuel markets, estimates of streamflows, availability of generating units, historic and forward market information, contract terms and experience.

On the basis of these projections, we make purchases and sales of electric capacity and energy, fuel for electric generation, and related derivative instruments to match expected resources to expected electric load requirements and reduce our exposure to electricity (or fuel) market price changes. The process of resource optimization involves scheduling and dispatching available resources as well as the following:

• | purchasing fuel for generation,


• | when economical, selling fuel and substituting wholesale electric purchases, and


• | other wholesale transactions to capture the value of generating resources, transmission contract rights and fuel delivery (transport) capacity contracts.

This optimization process includes entering into hedging transactions to manage risks. Transactions include both physical energy contracts and related derivative instruments, and the terms range from intra-hour up to multiple years.
Avista Utilities' generation assets are interconnected through the regional transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to enhance load-serving capability and reliability. We acquire both long-term and short-term transmission capacity to facilitate all of our energy and capacity transactions. We provide transmission and ancillary services in eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana.
Electric Requirements
Avista Utilities' peak electric native load requirement for 2017 was 1,681 MW, which occurred on January 5, 2017. In 2016, our peak electric native load was 1,655 MW, which occurred during the winter, and in 2015, it was 1,638 MW, which occurred during the summer.
Electric Resources
Avista Utilities has a diverse electric resource mix of Company-owned and contracted hydroelectric, thermal and wind generation facilities, and other contracts for power purchases and exchanges.
At the end of 2017, our Company-owned facilities had a total net capability of 1,875 MW, of which 56 percent was hydroelectric and 44 percent was thermal. See “Item 2. Properties” for detailed information on generating facilities.
Hydroelectric Resources Avista Utilities owns and operates six hydroelectric projects on the Spokane River and two hydroelectric projects on the Clark Fork River. Hydroelectric generation is typically our lowest cost source per MWh of electric energy and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on total power supply costs. Under normal streamflow and operating conditions, we estimate that we would be able to meet approximately one-half of our total average electric requirements (both retail and long-term wholesale) with the combination of our hydroelectric generation and long-term hydroelectric purchase contracts with certain PUDs in the state of Washington. Our estimate of normal annual hydroelectric 
5


AVISTA CORPORATION

generation for 2018 (including resources purchased under long-term hydroelectric contracts with certain PUDs) is 547 aMW (or 4.8 million MWhs). 
The following graph shows Avista Utilities' hydroelectric generation (in thousands of MWhs) during the year ended December 31:

(1) | Normal hydroelectric generation is determined by reference to the effect of upstream dam regulation on median natural water flow. Natural water flow is the flow of the rivers without the influence of dams, whereas regulated water flow takes into account any water flow changes from upstream dams due to releasing or holding back water. The calculation of normal varies annually due to the timing of upstream dam regulation throughout the year.

Thermal Resources Avista Utilities owns the following thermal generating resources:

• | the combined cycle CT natural gas-fired Coyote Springs 2 located near Boardman, Oregon,


• | a 15 percent interest in a twin-unit, coal-fired boiler generating facility, Colstrip 3 & 4, located in southeastern Montana,


• | a wood waste-fired boiler generating facility known as the Kettle Falls Generating Station (Kettle Falls GS) in northeastern Washington,


• | a two-unit natural gas-fired CT generating facility, located in northeastern Spokane (Northeast CT),


• | a two-unit natural gas-fired CT generating facility in northern Idaho (Rathdrum CT), and


• | two small natural gas-fired generating facilities (Boulder Park GS and Kettle Falls CT).

Coyote Springs 2, which is operated by Portland General Electric Company, is supplied with natural gas under a combination of term contracts and spot market purchases, including transportation agreements with bilateral renewal rights.
Colstrip, which is operated by Talen Montana, is supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through 2029. In addition, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis, Environmental Issues and Contingencies" for further discussion regarding environmental issues surrounding Colstrip.

AVISTA CORPORATION

The primary fuel for the Kettle Falls GS is wood waste generated as a by-product and delivered by trucks from forest industry operations within 100 miles of the plant. A combination of long-term contracts and spot purchases has provided, and is expected to meet, fuel requirements for the Kettle Falls GS.
The Northeast CT, Rathdrum CT, Boulder Park GS and Kettle Falls CT generating units are primarily used to meet peaking electric requirements. We also operate these facilities when marginal costs are below prevailing wholesale electric prices. These generating facilities have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs.
See "Item 2. Properties - Avista Utilities - Generation Properties" for the nameplate rating and present generating capabilities of the above thermal resources.
We have the exclusive rights to all the capacity of the Lancaster Plant, a 270 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle combustion turbine plant located in northern Idaho, owned by an unrelated third-party. All of the output from the Lancaster Plant is contracted to us through 2026 under a PPA. Under the terms of the PPA, we make the dispatch decisions, provide all natural gas fuel and receive all of the electric energy output from the Lancaster Plant; therefore, we consider this plant in our baseload resources. See "Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of this PPA.

The following graph shows Avista Utilities' thermal generation (in thousands of MWhs) during the year ended December 31:
Wind Resources We have exclusive rights to all the capacity of Palouse Wind, a wind generation project developed, owned and managed by an unrelated third-party and located in Whitman County, Washington. We have a PPA that expires in 2042 that requires us to acquire all of the power and renewable attributes produced by the project at a fixed price per MWh with a fixed escalation of the price over the term of the agreement. The project has a nameplate capacity of 105 MW. Generation from Palouse Wind was 300,380 MWhs in 2017, 349,771 MWhs in 2016 and 293,563 MWhs in 2015. We have an annual option to purchase the wind project beginning in December 2022. The purchase price is a fixed price per KW of in-service capacity with a fixed decline in the price per KW over the remaining 20-year term of the PPA. Under the terms of the PPA, we do not have any input into the day-to-day operation of the project, including maintenance decisions. All such rights are held by the owner.
Other Purchases, Exchanges and Sales In addition to the resources described above, we purchase and sell power under various long-term contracts, and we also enter into short-term purchases and sales. Further, pursuant to PURPA, as amended, we are required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities. This includes, among other resources, hydroelectric projects, cogeneration projects and wind generation projects at rates approved by the WUTC and the IPUC.

AVISTA CORPORATION

See “Avista Utilities Electric Operating Statistics – Electric Operations” for annual quantities of purchased power, wholesale power sales and power from exchanges in 2017, 2016 and 2015. See “Electric Operations” above for additional information with respect to the use of wholesale purchases and sales as part of our resource optimization process and also see "Future Resource Needs" below for the magnitude of these power purchase and sales contracts in future periods.
Hydroelectric Licenses
Avista Corp. is a licensee under the Federal Power Act (FPA) as administered by the FERC, which includes regulation of hydroelectric generation resources. Excluding the Little Falls Hydroelectric Generating Project (Little Falls), our other seven hydroelectric plants are regulated by the FERC through two project licenses. The licensed projects are subject to the provisions of Part I of the FPA. These provisions include payment for headwater benefits, condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation, and take-over by the federal government of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of “net investment” or “fair value” of the project, in either case, plus severance damages. In the unlikely event that a take-over occurs, it could lead to either the decommissioning of the hydroelectric project or offering the project to another party (likely through sale and transfer of the license).
Cabinet Gorge and Noxon Rapids are under one 45-year FERC license issued in 2001. See “Cabinet Gorge Total Dissolved Gas Abatement Plan” in “Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of dissolved atmospheric gas levels that exceed state of Idaho and federal numeric water quality standards downstream of Cabinet Gorge during periods when we must divert excess river flows over the spillway, as well as our mitigation plans and efforts.
Five of our six hydroelectric projects on the Spokane River (Long Lake, Nine Mile, Upper Falls, Monroe Street and Post Falls) are under one 50-year FERC license issued in 2009 and are referred to collectively as the Spokane River Project. The sixth, Little Falls, is operated under separate Congressional authority and is not licensed by the FERC.
Future Resource Needs
Avista Utilities has operational strategies to provide sufficient resources to meet our energy requirements under a range of operating conditions. These operational strategies consider the amount of energy needed, which varies widely because of the factors that influence demand over intra-hour, hourly, daily, monthly and annual durations. Our average hourly load was 1,070 aMW in 2017, 1,033 aMW in 2016 and 1,047 aMW in 2015.
The following graph shows our forecast of our average annual energy requirements and our available resources for 2018 through 2021:

AVISTA CORPORATION


(1) | The contracts for power sales decrease due to certain contracts expiring in each of these years. We are evaluating the future plan for the additional resources made available due to the expiration of these contracts.


(2) | The forecast assumes near normal hydroelectric generation.


(3) | Includes the Lancaster Plant PPA. Excludes Boulder Park GS, Kettle Falls CT, Northeast CT and Rathdrum CT, as these are considered peaking facilities and are generally not used to meet our base load requirements.


(4) | The combined maximum capacity of Boulder Park GS, Kettle Falls CT, Northeast CT and Rathdrum CT is 278 MW, with estimated available energy production as indicated for each year.

In August 2017, we filed our 2017 Electric IRP with the WUTC and the IPUC. The WUTC and IPUC review the IRPs and give the public the opportunity to comment. The WUTC and IPUC do not approve or disapprove of the content in the IRPs; rather they acknowledge that the IRPs were prepared in accordance with applicable standards if that is the case. The IRP details projected growth in demand for energy and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next 20 years. We regard the IRP as a tool for resource evaluation, rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project.
Highlights of the 2017 IRP include the following expectations and/or assumptions:

• | Our current generation resources will remain cost effective and reliable sources of power to meet future customer needs over the next 20 years.


• | Energy storage costs are significantly lower than those assumed in the 2015 IRP, which, for the first time, makes the energy storage technology operationally attractive in meeting energy needs in the 20-year timeframe of the 2017 IRP.


• | A power purchase agreement for a solar facility of at least 15 MW for our new Solar Select Program for commercial and industrial customers.


• | Conservation will effectively provide 53 percent of the requirements of future load growth.


• | Colstrip will remain a cost effective and reliable source of power to meet future customer needs.


• | If Colstrip were retired in 2030, total customer bills would increase approximately $50.0 million in the first year following retirement.

Major changes from the 2015 IRP include the following expectations and/or assumptions:

• | The 2017 Expected Case energy forecast will grow at 0.47 percent per year, replacing the 0.6 percent annual growth rate in the 2015 IRP. See "Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis – Economic Conditions and Utility Load Growth" for further discussion regarding utility customer growth, load growth, and the general economic conditions in our service territory. The estimates of future load growth in the IRP and at "Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis – Economic Conditions and Utility Load Growth" differ slightly due to the timing of when the two estimates were prepared and due to the time period that each estimate is focused on.


• | Peak load growth will be lower than energy growth, at 0.42 percent for the winter and 0.46 percent for the summer.


• | Lower expected load growth combined with recent Mid-Columbia hydroelectric contracts, energy efficiency, and demand response will delay the need for additional resources from the end of 2020 until 2026.


• | Demand response (temporarily reducing the demand for energy) is a viable strategy for meeting future energy needs and energy storage and solar have been added as future resources.


• | We expect lower emissions from Avista Corp. owned and controlled resources due to lower utilization of natural-gas fired peaking plants and no new combined-cycle plants.

We are required to file an electric IRP every two years, with the next IRP expected to be filed during the third quarter of 2019. Our resource strategy may change from the 2017 IRP based on market, legislative and regulatory developments.
We are subject to the Washington state Energy Independence Act, which requires us to obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of RECs and acquiring all cost effective conservation measures. Future generation resource decisions will be affected by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements.
While not specifically addressed in the IRP, regionally, there are potential regulatory or legislative initiatives that could introduce carbon pricing or cap-and-trade mechanisms related to greenhouse gas emissions. If any of these initiatives are implemented, they could change the economics associated with operating Colstrip 3 & 4 such that the units are no longer cost effective for future customer needs. We cannot currently determine the likelihood or impact of those initiatives, but we believe if Colstrip 3 & 4 are no longer cost effective, it is reasonable to expect that there would be a regulatory process to address any

undepreciated assets associated with Colstrip 3 & 4, as well as the costs associated with replacement generation and any other unforeseen closure costs that might be incurred.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition – Environmental Issues and Contingencies” for information related to existing laws, as well as potential legislation that could influence our future electric resource mix.
Natural Gas Operations
General Avista Utilities provides natural gas distribution services to retail customers in parts of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeastern and southwestern Oregon.
Market prices for natural gas, like other commodities, can be volatile. Our natural gas procurement strategy is to provide a reliable supply to our customers with some level of price certainty. We procure natural gas from various supply basins and over varying time periods. The resulting portfolio is a diversified mix of forward fixed price purchases, index and spot market purchases, utilizing physical and financial derivative instruments. We also use natural gas storage to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices may be lower. Securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years provides a level of price certainty and can mitigate price volatility to customers between years.
Weather is a key component of our natural gas customer load. This load is highly variable and daily natural gas loads can differ significantly from the monthly forecasted load projections. We make continuing projections of our natural gas loads and assess available natural gas resources. On the basis of these projections, we plan and execute a series of transactions to hedge a portion of our customers' projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments. These transactions may extend for multiple years into the future. We also leave a portion of our natural gas supply requirements unhedged for purchase in the short-term spot markets. 
Our purchase of natural gas supply is governed by our procurement plan and is reviewed and approved annually by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which is comprised of certain officers and other management personnel. Once approval is received, the plan is implemented and monitored by our gas supply and risk management groups.
The plan’s progress is also presented to the WUTC and IPUC staff in semi-annual meetings, and updates are given to the OPUC staff quarterly. Other stakeholders, such as the Public Counsel Unit of the Office of the Attorney General or the Citizen Utility Board, are invited to participate. The RMC is provided with an update on plan results and changes in their monthly meetings. These activities provide transparency for the natural gas supply procurement plan. Any material changes to the plan are documented and communicated to RMC members. 
As part of the process of balancing natural gas retail load requirements with resources, we engage in the wholesale purchase and sale of natural gas. We plan for sufficient natural gas delivery capacity to serve our retail customers for a theoretical peak day event. As such, we generally have more pipeline and storage capacity than what is needed during periods other than a peak day. We optimize our natural gas resources by using market opportunities to generate economic value that helps mitigate fixed costs. Wholesale sales are delivered through wholesale market facilities outside of our natural gas distribution system. Natural gas resource optimization activities include, but are not limited to:

• | wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies,


• | purchases and sales of natural gas to optimize use of pipeline and storage capacity, and


• | participation in the transportation capacity release market.

We also provide distribution transportation service to qualified, large commercial and industrial natural gas customers who purchase natural gas through third-party marketers. For these customers, we receive their purchased natural gas from such third-party marketers into our distribution system and deliver it to the customers’ premise.
Optimization transactions that we engage in throughout the year are included in our annual purchased gas cost adjustment filings with the various commissions and are subject to review for prudence during this process.
Natural Gas Supply Avista Utilities purchases all of its natural gas in wholesale markets. We are connected to multiple supply basins in the western United States and Canada through firm capacity transportation rights on six different pipeline networks. Access to this diverse portfolio of natural gas resources allows us to make natural gas procurement decisions that benefit our natural gas customers. These interstate pipeline transportation rights provide the capacity to serve approximately 25 percent of peak natural gas customer demands from domestic sources and 75 percent from Canadian sourced supply. Natural gas prices in the Pacific Northwest are affected by global energy markets, as well as supply and demand factors in other regions of the United States and Canada. Future prices and delivery constraints may cause our resource mix to vary.
10


AVISTA CORPORATION

Natural Gas Storage Avista Utilities owns a one-third interest in Jackson Prairie, an underground aquifer natural gas storage field located near Chehalis, Washington. Jackson Prairie has a total peak day deliverability of 12 million therms, with a total working natural gas capacity of 256 million therms. As an owner, our share is one-third of the peak day deliverability and total working capacity. We also contract for additional storage capacity and delivery at Jackson Prairie from Northwest Pipeline for a portion of their one-third share of the storage project.
We optimize our natural gas storage capacity throughout the year by executing transactions that capture favorable market price spreads. Natural gas buyers identify opportunities to purchase lower cost natural gas in the immediate term to inject into storage, and then sell the gas in a forward market to be withdrawn at a later time. The reverse of this type of transaction also occurs. These transactions lock in incremental value for customers. Jackson Prairie is also used as a variable peaking resource, and to protect from extreme daily price volatility during cold weather or other events affecting the market.
Future Resource Needs In August 2016, we filed our 2016 Natural Gas IRP with the WUTC, IPUC and the OPUC. The natural gas IRPs are similar in nature to the electric IRPs and the process for preparation and review by the state commissions of both the electric and natural gas IRPs is similar. The IRP details projected growth in demand for energy and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next 20 years. We regard the IRP as a tool for resource evaluation, rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project.
Highlights of the 2016 natural gas IRP include the following expectations and/or assumptions:

• | We will have sufficient natural gas transportation resources well into the future with resource needs not occurring during the 20-year planning horizon in Washington, Idaho, or Oregon.


• | Natural gas commodity prices will continue to be relatively stable due to robust North American supplies led by shale gas development.


• | Future customer growth in our service territory will increase slightly compared to the 2014 IRP. There will be increasing interest from customers to utilize natural gas due to its abundant supply and subsequent low cost. We anticipate that any increased demand in the region will primarily come from power generation as natural gas is increasingly being used to back up solar and wind technology, as well as replace retired coal plants. There is also potential for increased usage in other markets, such as transportation and as an industrial feedstock.


• | The availability of natural gas in North America will continue to change global LNG dynamics. Existing and new LNG facilities will look to export low cost North American natural gas to the higher priced Asian and European markets. This could alter the price of natural gas and/or transportation, constrain existing pipeline networks, stimulate development of new pipeline resources, and change flows of natural gas across North America.

Since forecasted demand is relatively flat, we will monitor actual demand for signs of increased growth which could accelerate resource needs.
We are required to file a natural gas IRP every two years, with the next IRP expected to be filed during the third quarter of 2018. Our resource strategy in our 2018 IRP may change from the 2016 IRP based on market, legislative and regulatory developments.
Regulatory Issues
General As a public utility, Avista Corp. is subject to regulation by state utility commissions for prices, accounting, the issuance of securities and other matters. The retail electric and natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the WUTC, IPUC, OPUC and MPSC. Approval of the issuance of securities is not required from the MPSC. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC for licensing of hydroelectric generation resources, and for electric transmission services and wholesale sales.
Since Avista Corp. is a “holding company” (in addition to being itself an operating utility), we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which imposes certain reporting and other requirements. We, and all of our subsidiaries (whether or not engaged in any energy related business), are required to maintain books, accounts and other records in accordance with the FERC regulations and to make them available to the FERC and the state utility commissions. In addition, upon the request of any jurisdictional state utility commission, the FERC would have the authority to review assignment of costs of non-power goods and administrative services among us and our subsidiaries. The FERC has the authority generally to require that rates subject to its jurisdiction be just and reasonable and in this context would continue to be able to, among other things, review transactions of any affiliated company.
11


AVISTA CORPORATION

Our rates for retail electric and natural gas services (other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers, which are subject to regulatory review and approval) are generally determined on a “cost of service” basis. 

Rates are designed to provide an opportunity for us to recover allowable operating expenses and earn a return of and a reasonable return on “rate base.” Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred income taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the utility commissions. Our operating expenses and rate base are allocated or directly assigned to five regulatory jurisdictions: electric in Washington and Idaho, and natural gas in Washington, Idaho and Oregon. In general, requests for new retail rates are made on the basis of revenues, operating expenses and net investment for a test year that ended prior to the date of the request, subject to possible adjustments, which differ among the various jurisdictions, designed to reflect the expected revenues, operating expenses and net investment during the period new retail rates will be in effect. The retail rates approved by the state commissions in a rate proceeding may not provide sufficient revenues to provide recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, unexpected changes in revenues, expenses and investment following the time new retail rates are requested in the rate proceeding, the denial by the commission of recovery, or timely recovery, of certain expenses or investment and the limitation by the commission of the authorized return on investment.
Our rates for wholesale electric and natural gas transmission services are based on either “cost of service” principles or market-based rates as set forth by the FERC. See “Notes 1 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information about regulation, depreciation and deferred income taxes.
General Rate Cases Avista Utilities regularly reviews the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – General Rate Cases” for information on general rate case activity.
Power Cost Deferrals Avista Utilities defers the recognition in the income statement of certain power supply costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by the WUTC and the IPUC. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – Power Cost Deferrals and Recovery Mechanisms” and “Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in Washington and Idaho.
Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) Under established regulatory practices in each state, Avista Utilities defers the recognition in the income statement of the natural gas costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by each of our jurisdictions. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – Purchased Gas Adjustments” and “Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on natural gas cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
Decoupling and Earnings Sharing Mechanisms Decoupling is a mechanism designed to sever the link between a utility's revenues and consumers' energy usage. In each of Avista Utilities' jurisdictions, each month Avista Utilities' electric and natural gas revenues are adjusted so as to be based on the number of customers in certain customer rate classes and assumed "normal" kilowatt hour and therm sales, rather than being based on actual kilowatt hour and therm sales. The difference between revenues based on the number of customers and revenues based on actual usage is deferred and either surcharged or rebated to customers beginning in the following year. Only the residential and commercial customer classes are included in our decoupling mechanisms. In conjunction with the decoupling mechanisms, Washington includes an after-the-fact earnings test. At the end of each calendar year, earnings calculations are made for the prior calendar year and a portion of any earnings above a certain threshold are deferred and later returned to customers. Oregon also has an annual earnings review, not directly associated with the decoupling mechanism, where earnings above a certain threshold are deferred and later returned to customers. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – Decoupling and Earnings Sharing Mechanisms” for further discussion of these mechanisms. 
Federal Laws Related to Wholesale Competition
Federal law promotes practices that foster competition in the electric wholesale energy market. The FERC requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers, and requires electric utilities to enhance or construct transmission facilities to create additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services. Public utilities (through subsidiaries or affiliates) and other entities may participate in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers.
12


AVISTA CORPORATION

Public utilities operating under the FPA are required to provide open and non-discriminatory access to their transmission systems to third parties and establish an Open Access Same-Time Information System to provide an electronic means by which transmission customers can obtain information about available transmission capacity and purchase transmission access. The FERC also requires each public utility subject to the rules to operate its transmission and wholesale power merchant operating functions separately and to comply with standards of conduct designed to ensure that all wholesale users, including the public utility’s power merchant operations, have equal access to the public utility’s transmission system. Our compliance with these standards has not had any substantive impact on the operation, maintenance and marketing of our transmission system or our ability to provide service to customers.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Competition” for further information.
Regional Transmission Planning
Beginning with FERC Order No. 888 and continuing with subsequent rulemakings and policies, the FERC has encouraged better coordination and operational consistency aimed to capture efficiencies that might otherwise be gained through the formation of a Regional Transmission Organization or an independent system operator (ISO). 
Avista Utilities meets its FERC requirements to coordinate transmission planning activities with other regional entities through ColumbiaGrid. ColumbiaGrid is a Washington nonprofit membership corporation with an independent board formed to improve the operational efficiency, reliability, and planned expansion of the transmission grid in the Pacific Northwest. We became a member of ColumbiaGrid in 2006 during its formation. ColumbiaGrid is not an ISO, but fills the role of facilitating the regional transmission planning requirements of FERC Order No. 1000, and other clarifying FERC Orders, for its members. ColumbiaGrid and its members also work with other western organizations to address transmission planning, including WestConnect and the Northern Tier Transmission Group (NTTG). In 2011, we became a registered Planning Participant of the NTTG. We will continue to assess the benefits of entering into other functional agreements with ColumbiaGrid and/or participating in other forums to attain operational efficiencies and to meet FERC policy objectives.
Regional Energy Markets
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has an EIM in the western United States. Most investor-owned utilities in the Pacific Northwest are either participants in the CAISO EIM or plan to integrate into the market in the near future. The decision to join the CAISO EIM is based on a number of factors, including the amount of variable generating resources in the utilities’ systems, the ability to manage the variable generating resources within the utilities’ systems, the costs associated with joining the CAISO EIM, and the economic benefits associated with joining the CAISO EIM. We have conducted analyses with respect to joining the CAISO EIM, and we currently do not believe there is a compelling case to do so. As additional utilities join the CAISO EIM, there could be a reduction in bilateral market liquidity and opportunities for wholesale transactions in the Pacific Northwest. We will continue to monitor the CAISO EIM expansion and the associated impacts. As market fundamentals and our business needs evolve, we will weigh the advantages and disadvantages of joining the CAISO EIM or other organized energy markets in the future.
Reliability Standards
Among its other provisions, the U.S. Energy Policy Act provides for the implementation of mandatory reliability standards and authorizes the FERC to assess penalties for non-compliance with these standards and other FERC regulations.
The FERC certified the NERC as the single Electric Reliability Organization authorized to establish and enforce reliability standards and delegate authority to regional entities for the purpose of establishing and enforcing reliability standards. The FERC approves NERC Reliability Standards, including western region standards that make up the set of legally enforceable standards for the United States bulk electric system. The first of these reliability standards became effective in 2007. From time to time new standards are developed or existing standards are updated, revised, consolidated or eliminated pursuant to an industry-involved process. We are required to self-certify our compliance with these standards on an annual basis and undergo regularly scheduled periodic reviews by the NERC and its regional entity, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). Failure to comply with NERC reliability standards could result in financial penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. We have a robust internal compliance program in place to manage compliance activities and mitigate the risk of potential noncompliance with these standards. We do not expect the costs associated with compliance with these standards to have a material impact on our financial results.
Peak Reliability is the reliability coordinator in the Western Interconnection that performs reliability coordinator functions for its funding parties, including Avista Corp. The CAISO, which is a significant Peak Reliability funding party recently submitted its notice of withdrawal from Peak Reliability, effective on September 2, 2019. We are evaluating the impact of CAISO’s

withdrawal on our cost of obtaining reliability coordinator services, which impact cannot be accurately determined at this time. We are also evaluating all alternatives for obtaining the required reliability coordinator services.
Vulnerability to Cyber Attack
It has been widely reported that the energy sector, particularly electric and natural gas utility companies in the United States and abroad, have become the subject of cyber-attacks with increased frequency. The Company’s administrative and operating networks are targeted by hackers on a regular basis.
A successful attack on the Company’s administrative networks could compromise the security and privacy of data, including operating, financial and personal information. A successful attack on the Company’s operating networks could impair the operation of the Company’s electric and/or natural gas utility facilities, possibly resulting in the inability to provide electric and/or natural gas service for extended periods of time.
The Company continually reinforces and updates its defensive systems and is in compliance with NERC’s reliability standards. See “Reliability Standards," "Item 1A. Risk Factors – Technology Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Enterprise Risk Management – Technology Risks” for further information.

AVISTA CORPORATION

ALASKA ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY
AEL&P is the primary operating subsidiary of AERC. AEL&P is the sole utility providing electrical energy in Juneau, Alaska. Juneau is a geographically isolated community with no electric interconnections with the transmission facilities of other utilities and no pipeline access to natural gas or other fuels. Juneau’s economy is primarily driven by government activities, tourism, commercial fishing, and mining, as well as activities as the commercial hub of southeast Alaska.
AEL&P owns and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities located in Juneau. AEL&P operates five hydroelectric generation facilities with 102.7 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity as of December 31, 2017. AEL&P owns four of these generation facilities (totaling 24.5 MW of capacity) and has a PPA for the output of the Snettisham hydroelectric project (totaling 78.2 MW of capacity). 
The Snettisham hydroelectric project is owned by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA), a public corporation of the State of Alaska. AIDEA issued revenue bonds in 1998 (which were refinanced in 2015) to finance its acquisition of the project. These bonds were outstanding in the amount of $59.7 million at December 31, 2017 and mature in January 2034. AEL&P has a PPA and operating and maintenance agreement with the AIDEA to operate and maintain the facility. This PPA is a take-or-pay obligation, expiring in December 2038, to purchase all of the output of the project. AIDEA's bonds are payable solely out of the revenues received under the PPA.
For accounting purposes, this PPA is treated as a capital lease and, as of December 31, 2017, the capital lease obligation was $59.7 million. Snettisham Electric Company, a non-operating subsidiary of AERC, has the option to purchase the Snettisham project at any time for a price equal to the principal amount of the bonds outstanding at that time. See "Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the Snettisham capital lease obligation.
As of December 31, 2017, AEL&P also had 107.5 MW of diesel generating capacity from four facilities to provide back-up service to firm customers when necessary.
The following graph shows AEL&P's hydroelectric generation (in thousands of MWhs) during the time periods indicated below:

(1) | Normal hydroelectric generation is defined as the energy output of the plant during a year with average inflows to the reservoir.

As of December 31, 2017, AEL&P served approximately 17,000 customers. Its primary customers include city, state and federal governmental entities located in Juneau, as well as a mine located in the Juneau area. Most of AEL&P’s customers are served on a firm basis while certain of its customers, including its largest customer, are served on an interruptible sales basis. AEL&P maintains separate rate tariffs for each of its customer classes, as well as seasonal rates.

AVISTA CORPORATION

AEL&P’s operations are subject to regulation by the RCA with respect to rates, standard of service, facilities, accounting and certain other matters, but not with respect to the issuance of securities. Rate adjustments for AEL&P’s customers require approval by the RCA pursuant to RCA regulations. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters" for further discussion of AEL&P's latest general rate case filing, including its capital structure.
AEL&P is also subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC concerning the permits and licenses necessary to operate certain of its hydroelectric facilities. One of these licenses (for the Salmon Creek and Annex Creek hydroelectric projects) expires in August 2018, but AEL&P is in the process of renewing and expects the renewed license to be effective in September 2018. Since AEL&P has no electric interconnection with other utilities and makes no wholesale sales, it is not subject to general FERC jurisdiction, other than the reporting and other requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 as an Avista Corp. subsidiary.
The Snettisham hydroelectric project is subject to regulation by the State of Alaska with respect to dam safety and certain aspects of its operations. In addition, AEL&P is subject to regulation with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters under both federal and state laws.
