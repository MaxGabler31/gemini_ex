Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. From that date until November 30, 2004, when we entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was formerly known as Trophy Tech Corporation (the “Acquired Company”), we had not conducted any operations and were a closely-held company. In conjunction with the merger, we were renamed Digital Ally, Inc.
 
On January 2, 2008, we commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DGLY.” We conduct our business from 14001 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas 66215. Our telephone number is (913) 814-7774. Our website address is www.digitalallyinc.com. The contents of, or information accessible through, our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, as well as beneficial ownership filings available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with, or furnish such reports to, the SEC.
 
The Acquired Company, which was incorporated on May 16, 2003, engaged in the design, development, marketing and sale of bow hunting-related products. Its principal product was a digital video recording system for use in the bow hunting industry. We changed its business plan in 2004 to adapt its digital video recording system for use in the law enforcement and security markets. We began shipments of our in-car digital video rear view mirror in March 2006. Over the years, the Company developed additional products and services that complemented its core digital video recording systems and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers including an expansion beyond the traditional law enforcement channel to include commercial users.
 
The Company has recently expanded beyond its legacy business digital video recording system for use in the law enforcement and security markets to two new reportable operating segments. Currently, the Company’s reportable operating segments are: 1) the Video Solutions Segment, 2) the Revenue Cycle Management Segment and 3) the Ticketing Segment. The Video Solutions Segment is our legacy business that produces digital video imaging, storage products, disinfectant and related safety products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. This segment includes both service and product revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety solutions. The Revenue Cycle Management Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout the country, as a monthly service fee. The Ticketing Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing platform, Ticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms. The following table sets forth the Company’s total revenue and the revenue derived from each reportable operating segment:
 

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Net Revenues: | | | | | 
Video Solutions | $ | 9,073,626 | | $ | 10,514,868
Revenue Cycle Management | | 1,630,048 | | | — 
Ticketing | | 10,709,760 | | | — 
Total Net Revenues | $ | 21,413,434 | | $ | 10,514,868

 
Additional information regarding each reportable operating segment is also included in Note 21 entitled Segment Data of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.
 
Video Solutions Operating Segment


Within the Video Solutions reportable operating segment we supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create positive solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include: the EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, which are in-car digital video systems for law enforcement and commercial markets; the FirstVu body-worn camera line, consisting of the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and the FirstVu HD; our patented and revolutionary VuLink product, which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation for both law enforcement and commercial markets; the FLT-250, DVM-250, and DVM-250 Plus, which are our commercial line of digital video mirrors that serve as “event recorders” for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets; FleetVu, EVO Web, and VuVault are our cloud-based evidence management systems. We further diversified and broadened our product offerings in 2020, by introducing two new lines of branded products: (1) the ThermoVu® which is a line of self-contained temperature monitoring stations that provides alerts and controls facility access when an individual’s temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold and (2) our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers which are for use against viruses and bacteria. We began offering our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers to our law enforcement and commercial customers late in the second quarter of 2020.
Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment
 
We entered the revenue cycle management operating segment late in the second quarter of 2021 with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and a second acquisition on August 31, 2021 upon the completion of its acquisition of another private medical billing company, in which we will assist in providing working capital and back-office services to healthcare organizations throughout the country. Our assistance consists of insurance and benefit verification, medical treatment documentation and coding, and collections. Through our expertise and experience in this field, we maximize our customers’ service revenues collected, leading to substantial improvements in their operating margins and cash flows.
 
We plan to continue growing our revenue cycle management operating segment primarily through a roll-up strategy. Our revenue cycle management operating segment’s acquisition targets include the approximate 6,000 medical billing companies in the United States, most of which are relatively small and closely-held private concerns. Each year a portion of these company owners sell because they want to retire or exit the business for other pursuits. The revenue cycle management market is quite fragmented with the largest companies having less than an estimated 5% of the total market. The Company formed the revenue cycle management operating segment and will provide the capital to make acquisitions and pursue the revenue cycle management company roll-up strategy.
 
Upon completion of the acquisitions our revenue cycle management operating segment processes and submits the medical reimbursement claims of its physician clients to commercial health insurance companies and Medicare/Medicaid for the services the physicians have rendered to their patients so they can receive payments. Our revenue cycle management operating segment receives a percentage of the cash collected for its service fees. The revenue cycle management agreements with physician clients generally renew automatically on an annual basis.
 
Ticketing Operating Segment
 
We entered into the ticketing operating segment through the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc. (“TicketSmarter”) and its completed acquisitions of Goody Tickets, LLC and TicketSmarter, LLC, on September 1, 2021. TicketSmarter provides ticket sales, partnerships, and mainly, ticket resale services through its online ticketing marketplace for live events, TicketSmarter.com. TicketSmarter offers tickets for over 125,000 live events through its platform, for a wide range of events, including concerts, sporting events, theatres, and performing arts, throughout the country.

TicketSmarter has grown rapidly since its launch in early 2019, and currently boasts more than 48 million tickets for sale over 125,000 live events, primarily serving the North American market. It has built its brand with a number of high-profile partnerships, which include being the official ticket resale partner of Rose Bowl Stadium in California and the title sponsor of the TicketSmarter Birmingham Bowl. It is also the official ticket resale partner of more than 35 collegiate conferences and 250 individual universities. Goody Tickets was launched as a ticket brokerage nearly a decade earlier in Overland Park, Kansas, where it has remained.
 
The Company plans to grow the Ticketing operating segment through organic growth of its existing business lines. The Company will also provide the working capital necessary to expand its sponsorships and partnerships with other sporting teams and other entertainment venues and organizations,


COVID – 19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a fluid situation that presents a wide range of potential impacts of varying durations for different global geographies, including locations where the Company has offices, employees, customers, vendors and other suppliers and business partners.
 
Like most US-based businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the same began to have impacts on our business in March 2020. Since that time, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, including millions of confirmed cases, business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortages, supply chain challenges, changes in government spending and requirements, regulatory challenges, inflationary pressures and market volatility.


We operate within the complex integrated global supply chain for both vendors and customers. As the COVID-19 pandemic dissipates at varying times and rates in different regions around the world, there could be a prolonged negative impact on these global supply chains. Our ability to continue operations at specific facilities will be impacted by the interdependencies of the various participants of these global supply chains, which are largely beyond our direct control. A prolonged shut down of these global supply chains could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
 
If our suppliers have increased challenges with their workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism, reactions to health and safety or government requirements), facility closures, timely access to necessary components, materials and other supplies at reasonable prices, access to capital, and access to fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation), they may be unable to provide the agreed-upon goods and services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner. We have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs and delays in our business resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of higher prices, schedule delays or the need to identify and develop alternative suppliers. In some instances, we may be unable to identify and develop alternative suppliers, incurring additional liabilities under our current contracts and hampering new ones. Our customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, current, and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures or delays, and increased border controls, delays or closures, can also impact our ability to meet demand and could materially adversely affect us.
 
The spread of COVID-19 caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and social distancing measures), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, vendors, and suppliers. Although we managed to continue most of our operations, the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain and we cannot assure that this global pandemic, including its economic impact, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.


Our Video Operating Segment Products and Services
 
Through our video operating segment we supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create positive solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include: the EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, which are in-car digital video systems for law enforcement and commercial markets; the FirstVu body-worn camera line, consisting of the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu, and the FirstVu HD; our patented and revolutionary VuLink product integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation for both law enforcement and commercial markets; the FLT-250, DVM-250, and DVM-250 Plus, which are our commercial line of digital video mirrors that serve as “event recorders” for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets; and FleetVu and VuLink, which are our cloud-based evidence management systems. We further diversified and broadened our product offerings in 2020, by introducing two new lines of branded products: (1) the ThermoVu® which is a line of self-contained temperature monitoring stations that provides alerts and controls facility access when an individual’s temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold and (2) our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers which are for use against viruses and bacteria. We began offering our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers to our law enforcement and commercial customers late in the second quarter of 2020.

In-Car Digital Video Mirror System for Law Enforcement – EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite
 
In-car video systems for patrol cars are a necessity and have generally become standard. Current systems are primarily digital based systems with cameras mounted on the windshield and the recording device generally in the trunk, headliner, dashboard, console or under the seat of the vehicle.
 
The Company launched its in-car digital video platform under the name EVO-HD during the second quarter of 2019. The EVO-HD is a revolutionary in-car system that delivers versatility and reliability for law enforcement. With built-in, patented auto-activation technology, EVO-HD captures multiple recording angles in sync from a FirstVu PRO or FirstVu HD body-worn camera and up to four HD in-car cameras – all from a single trigger. The EVO-HD maximizes space and offers top-end reliability when paired with remote service capabilities. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the VuVault.net cloud, powered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and real time metadata when in the field.

The Company offers the DVM-800, a continuation in the family of highly successful digital video mirrored (DVM) systems developed by the Company. The DVM-800 is a time-tested, compact, powerful and easy-to-use solution designed for law enforcement. The DVM-800 system has built-in road and driver facing cameras and can record up to two external HD cameras. The DVM-800 is compatible with the patented VuLink® auto-activation technology and can be paired with a FirstVu HD body-worn camera.
 
The Company also offers the DVM-800 Lite, an entry level system is a self-contained video recorder, microphone and digital storage system that is integrated into a rear-view mirror and is designed for law enforcement. The system can record up to two internal HD cameras.
 
In-Car Digital Video “Event Recorder” System – DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 for Commercial Fleets
 
Digital Ally provides commercial fleets and commercial fleet managers with the digital video tools that they need to increase driver safety, track assets in real-time and minimize the company’s liability risk while enabling fleet managers to operate the fleet at an optimal level. We market a product designed to address these commercial fleet markets with our DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 event recorders that provide various types of commercial fleets with features and capabilities that are fully-customizable and consistent with their specific application and inherent risks.
 
The DVM-250 Plus is a part of the DVM family and is designed for commercial fleets featuring built-in digital audio and video recording technology and other features to provide commercial fleet managers unmatched driver and asset management – all while delivering the return on investment that matters most: the safety and security of drivers and passengers. The DVM-250 Plus is designed to capture events, such as wrecks and erratic driving or other abnormal occurrences, for evidentiary or training purposes. The commercial fleet markets may find our units attractive from both a feature and a cost perspective compared to other providers. Due to our marketing efforts, commercial fleets are beginning to adopt this technology, and in particular, the ambulance and taxi-cab markets.
 
In the first quarter of 2021, Digital Ally released the FLT-250, offering the same great features of the DVM-250 Plus in a new compact, non-mirrored form factor that allows for multiple mounting options in any vehicle type for commercial fleets. We believe that, due to non-mirror-based aspect of this product, the FLT-250 will become more attractive for our potential customers, as it is a much simpler plug and play option compared to mirror-based products.
 
Digital Ally offers a suite of data management web-based tools to assist fleet managers in the organization, archival, and management of videos and telematics information. Within the suite, there are powerful mapping and reporting tools that are intended to optimize efficiency, serve as training tools for teams on safety, and, ultimately, generate a significant return on investment for the organization.
 
The Company’s management expects EVO-HD to become the platform for a new family of in-car video solution products for the commercial markets. The innovative EVO-HD technology is expected to replace the current in-car mirror-based systems with a miniaturized system that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle, while offering numerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and requirements of the Company’s commercial customers. In its commercial market application, the EVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event and ECA capabilities to allow customers to review entire shifts. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the FleetVu Manager cloud-based system for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring, which is powered by AWS and real time metadata when in the field.
 
Miniature Body-Worn Digital Video System – FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and FirstVu HD for Law Enforcement and Private Security 
 
During 2021, Digital Ally launched two next generation body-worn cameras and docking stations, refreshing the Company’s complete ecosystem of evidence recording devices. The latest body worn camera launched by the Company is the FirstVu Pro, the Company’s flagship product in its family of next generation of technology. The light weight, one-piece unit captures full HD video and audio, while offering industry leading features such as live streaming, a full-color touchscreen display, an advanced image sensor with IR LEDs, proprietary image distortion reduction, IP67 rated resisting dust & wind and is water submersible for 30 minutes at a depth of 3 feet. It is also MIL-STD-810G compliant capable of handling drops, shock, and vibration; and will function flawlessly in a wide temperature range.

In addition to the FirstVu Pro, Digital Ally also added the FirstVu II to its family of next generation technology. The FirstVu II is a one-piece device offering industry leading technology such as an articulating camera head, a full-color display, an advanced image sensor, and GPS. It can be used in law enforcement, private and event security and commercial segments.
 
Digital Ally still carries the FirstVu HD, the two-piece body-worn camera which allows for multiple mounting options while minimizing space and weight. It can be used in law enforcement, private and event security and commercial segments. This system is also a derivative of our in-car video systems, but is much smaller and lighter and more rugged and water-resistant to handle a hostile outdoor environment. The FirstVu HD can be used in many applications in addition to law enforcement and private security and is designed specifically to be clipped to an individual’s pocket or other outer clothing. The unit is self-contained and requires no external battery or storage devices. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.
 
With the newly introduced body-worn cameras, Digital Ally also introduced two new QuickVu docking stations compatible with the FirstVu PRO and FirstVu II body-worn cameras. The QuickVu docking stations provide a comprehensive and elegant solution for storing and charging body cameras while uploading video evidence to the cloud. QuickVu also allows for rapid reviewing of footage right from the interactive touchscreen display, and is available in eight or twenty-four individual docking bays. For docking with the FirstVu HD body-worn cameras, Digital Ally offers a 12-bay docking station and Mini-Docks. The 12-bay docking station includes a 1TB local memory hard drive which simultaneously upload 4 hours of video from 12 FirstVu HD cameras within a 15-minute shift change and push configuration updates. The Mini-Dock is a single unit, portable smart dock that uploads video evidence to VuVault from a FirstVu HD body camera.
 
Auto-activation and Interconnectivity Between In-car Video Systems and Body-worn Camera Products – VuLink for Law Enforcement 
 
Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provides intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering a variety of triggers, incuding emergency lights and sirens, extreme acceleration or braking, g-force or any 12-volt relay. Additionally, the awarded patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to our VuLink ecosystem, officers had to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios, a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers’ attention during critical moments.
 
EVO Web and FleetVu Manager
 
EVO Web is a web-based software, powered by and hosted on the AWS GovCloud platform, that enables police departments and security agencies to manage digital video evidence quickly and easily. EVO Web is capable of playing back, reviewing, downloading, archiving, unit configuration and management, running customizable reports and maintaining a chain of custody logs. AWS is the most secure cloud platform on the market with features that go beyond simply storing and reviewing video evidence. AWS GovCloud platform is trusted by the Department of Justice, Defense Digital Services for the US Air Force, U.S. Department of Treasury, U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Our products that are compatible with EVO Web include: FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, FirstVu HD, QuickVu, EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite.
 
FleetVu Manager is a web-based software that provides commercial fleet managers with the tools to increase driver safety, track assets in real-time and minimize their companies’ liability risks. FleetVu Manager is able to generate driver reports, identify at risk behaviors before an incident takes place, and enable commercial fleet managers to manage the entire fleet through a single, easy to use platform. Our products compatible with FleetVu Manager include: DVM-250 and FLT-250.

Market and Industry Overview – Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Our video solutions segment has historically had a primary market of domestic and international law enforcement agencies. We have since expanded our scope by pursuing the commercial fleet vehicle and mass transit markets. Additionally, we have expanded into event security services where we provide the hardware and software to supplement private security for NASCAR races, football and other sporting events, concerts and other events where people gather. We continue to further expand our focus on private security, homeland security, mass transit, healthcare, general retail, educational, general consumer and other commercial markets. In that regard, we have several installations involving private security on cruise ships and similar markets. We believe there are many potential private uses of our product offerings. We continue to have sales in the commercial fleet and ambulance service provider market, confirming that our DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 products and FleetVu Manager can become a significant revenue producer for us. Additionally, our body-worn cameras have applications in law enforcement, along with private and event security, as well as commercial segments. With the recent acquisitions we completed in 2021, we hope to utilize the connections we now have to live events, stadiums, and arenas, as well as new medical connections.

Market and Industry Overview – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment
 
Our revenue cycle management segment consists of end-to-end revenue cycle management services that focuses on claim reimbursement billing, verification, and related services to medical providers throughout the country. We offer agreements with customers in which we provide our services and bill the customers monthly for our services. The healthcare industry in the United States represents a strong portion of the United States’ economy, offering a robust market for these services. Our current market includes many diverse specialties, including radiology, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, internal medicine, and cariology. We continue to investigate ways to expand our market reach, although can make no assurances in that regard.
Market and Industry Overview – Ticketing Operating Segment
 
Our ticketing segment refers to the sale of event tickets primarily through our online and mobile platforms. We will buy inventory of event ticket to then sell tickets through various platforms, including our own. Our resale services refer to the sale of tickets by a holder, who originally obtained the tickets directly from a venue or entity, through our platform in which we then collect services fees on the transaction. This is commonly referred to as secondary ticketing. We work directly with consumers looking to buy or sell event tickets for particular shows, concerts, games, and other events, allowing a simple and effective platform to move tickets. We also currently partner with more than 35 collegiate conferences, over 300 universities, and hundreds of events and venues.
Competition - Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Our video solutions segment, consisting of law enforcement and security surveillance markets, is extremely competitive. Competitive factors in these industries include ease of use, quality, portability, versatility, reliability, accuracy and cost. There are direct competitors with technology and products in the law enforcement and surveillance markets for all of our products, including those that are in development. Many of these competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources, more extensive distribution channels, larger customer bases and faster response times to adapt new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our primary competitors in the in-car video systems market include L-3 Mobile-Vision, Inc., Coban Technologies, Inc., Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video (“WatchGuard”), Kustom Signals, Panasonic System Communications Company, International Police Technologies, Inc. and a number of other competitors who sell, or may in the future sell, in-car video systems to law enforcement agencies. Our primary competitors in the body-worn camera market include Axon Enterprises, Inc. (“Axon”), Reveal Media, WatchGuard, and VieVU, Inc., which was acquired by Axon in 2018. We face similar and intense competitive factors for our event recorders in the commercial fleet and private security markets as we do in the law enforcement and security surveillance markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that new and existing companies will not enter the law enforcement and security surveillance markets in the future. The commercial fleet security and surveillance markets likewise are also very competitive. There are direct competitors for our FLT-250 and DVM-250 Plus “event recorders,” which may have greater financial, technical marketing, and manufacturing resources than we do. Our primary competitors in the commercial fleet sector include Lytx, Inc. (previously DriveCam, Inc.) and SmartDrive Systems, among others.
Competition – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment
 
Our revenue cycle management segment is a highly competitive market that is only intensifying as the market continues to grow. We face competition from a variety of sources, including internal revenue cycle management departments within healthcare organizations, as these organizations are beginning to make internal investments in these departments to keep these services in house. Additionally, other revenue cycle management providers exist and offer similar services through software vendors, traditional consultants, and information technology sources.
Competition – Ticketing Operating Segment
 
Our ticketing segment faces robust competition from several sources throughout the industry. As the online and mobile ticketing market continues to increase, it has allowed for more technology-based companies to offer ticketing services and systems. The online environment consists of numerous other websites and platforms for all markets. With the market continuing to grow, resale marketplaces and websites can reach a vastly larger audience with more convenient access to tickets for a wide variety of events. We continue to build our brand and recognition, through the numerous partnerships and sponsorships throughout the country, in attempt to become a preferred platform for consumers.
Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd.
 
In December 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd. (“Worldwide Re”), a Bermuda incorporated captive insurance company that will provide primarily liability insurance coverage to the Company for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace.
 
Worldwide Re is subject to capital and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). Although these capital requirements are generally less constraining than U.S. capital requirements, failure to satisfy these requirements could result in regulatory actions from the BMA or loss of or modification of Worldwide Re’s Class 1 insurer license, which could adversely impact our ability to support our insurance needs and to grow this business into another line of business for our holding company. To date, our captive’s relatively immature claims history limits the predictive value of estimating the costs of incurred and future claims. Accordingly, the captive could continue to incur significant fluctuations in financial results as the captive provides insurance coverage to Digital Ally and its affiliated businesses and seeks to expand beyond our affiliated companies to offer coverage for third parties.
 
Intellectual Property – Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Our video solutions operating segment’s ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad. We have filed for patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to cover certain design aspects of our products.
 
Some of our patent applications are still under review by the USPTO and, therefore, we have not yet been issued all the patents that we applied for in the United States. We were issued several patents in recent years, including a patent on our VuLink product that provides automatic triggering of our body-worn camera and our in-car video systems. No assurance can be given which, or any, of the patents relating to our existing technology will be issued from the United States or any foreign patent offices. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on our continued development of our technology, or that our patent protection within and/or outside of the United States will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technologies.

We have entered into supply and distribution agreements with several companies that produce certain of our products, including our DVM-250 and DVM-800 products. These supply and distribution agreements contain certain confidentiality provisions that protect our proprietary technology, as well as that of the third-party manufacturers.
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage. Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.

Our employees are our most important assets and they set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. All of our employees contribute to Digital Ally’s success and, in particular, the employees in our manufacturing, sales, research and development, and quality assurance departments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance, advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program.
 
Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We strive to create a culture and work environment that enables us to attract, train, promote, and retain a diverse group of talented employees who together can help us gain a competitive advantage. Our key programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:
 

● | Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits: the main objective of Digital Ally’s compensation program is to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward superior employees who must operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We seek to do this by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the employee’s financial interests with the interests of shareholders. Digital Ally also seeks fairness in total compensation with reference to external comparisons, internal comparisons and the relationship between management and non-management remuneration. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

● | We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance. 
● | Annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion. 
● | All employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, short-term disability, worker’s compensation, long-term disability, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs. 


● | Employee Health and Safety: the health and safety of our employees are top priorities, which was emphasized this year amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic. Digital Ally is committed to operating in a safe, secure and responsible manner for the benefit of its employees, customers and communities Digital Ally serves. Our safety focus is evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Our Securities
 
Our by-laws require that a quorum, generally consisting of a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock, be represented in person, by telephone or by proxy in order to transact business at a meeting of our stockholders. Failure to meet a quorum or obtain stockholder approval can prevent us from taking certain actions that may be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders.
 
A substantial majority of our shares of Common Stock are held by retail investors, and it may be difficult to communicate with the beneficial holders of those shares to obtain votes. In 2021, we were unable to obtain a quorum at four scheduled special meetings and annual meetings, which we believe hindered our ability to elect directors and increase the number of authorized shares. Obtaining a quorum at future stockholder meetings and obtaining necessary stockholder approvals will depend in part upon the willingness of an extensive number of smaller stockholders to continue participating in such meetings, and we cannot be assured that participation in the past will continue in the future. As a result, we may be unable to obtain a quorum at future annual or special meetings of stockholders or obtain stockholder approval of proposals when needed.

Even if we obtain a quorum at our stockholder meetings, we may not obtain enough votes to approve matters to be resolved upon at those meetings. For example, a proposal to ratify our selection of RBSM, LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, failed to receive sufficient votes to pass at the 2021 annual meeting of our stockholders. Moreover, broker-dealers may only vote shares absent direction from the beneficial owner on certain specified “routine” matters, such as the ratification of our auditors. If our stockholders do not instruct their brokers on how to vote their shares on “non-routine” matters, then we may not obtain the necessary number of votes for approval. Any future revisions to SEC or Nasdaq rules that further limit matters for which broker discretionary voting is allowed may further harm our ability to obtain a quorum and stockholder approval of certain matters. Therefore, it is possible that even if we are able to obtain a quorum for our meetings of stockholders, we still may not receive enough votes to approve proxy proposals presented at such meetings and, depending on the proposal in question, including if a proposal is submitted to our stockholders to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, such failure could have a material adverse effect on us.
