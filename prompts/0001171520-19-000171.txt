ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
 
Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 12, 2010. From March 2011 through the end of December 2017, we were engaged in the development of a social networking website, www.kababayanko.com, for overseas workers from the Philippines and others who share or are interested in their lifestyle. Since January 2018, our business has focused on the marketing and sale of food supplements and vitamins. Our fiscal year end is December 31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our social networking website aims to provide overseas workers from the Philippines with a platform to share their overseas working and living experiences, and interact with a community of Filipino overseas workers from around the world.
 
Our business offices are currently located at 11801 Pierce St., 2nd Floor, Riverside, California 92505. Our telephone number is (888) 770-5084.

OVERVIEW
 Provided we raise sufficient proceeds from the offering, although there can be no assurance at the present time, we expect to start generating revenues within 6 to 12 months following launch.
 
We are in the early stage of our business plan. We currently have no revenues and no customers. Our activities to date have been limited to organizational matters, development of our business plan, development of our website, and efforts related to becoming a publicly traded company.
 
Our administrative offices are currently located at 11801 Pierce St., 2nd Floor, Riverside, California 92505. We also conduct sales and marketing operations from Suite 6A-2 Victoria Station 1 #793 Edsa Cor., GMA Network Drive, Culiat, Quezon City, Second District, Philippines.
 
OUR WEBSITE
 
We have two websites: www.kababayanko.com and www.anavexchange.com. We expect to market and sell our food supplements and vitamins from our www.anavexchange.com website.
 
PRODUCTS
 
Our primary products are food supplements and vitamins, which we will market and sell under the WellnessPro brand name. Lance Rivera and Ronie Tan, as individuals, have entered into a non-binding, undated Memorandum of Understanding, with Dr. Tatiana Kolpakov and Michael Kolpakov, in which the parties have memorialized their intent that the Company will acquire 70% of WellnessPro. The Memorandum of Understanding is subject to negotiation and completion definitive agreements to make such an acquisition and stockholder approval by the Companyâ€™s stockholders. An acquisition of 70% of WellnessPro, or any other acquisition, is not probable.
SALE OF THIRD-PARTY GOODS
 
The Company intends to manufacture its food supplements and vitamins products by using third-party manufacturers in the U.S.
 
COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY
 
The level of competition in food supplements and vitamins industry is extremely high. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their products over ours. Economies of scale would make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of food supplement and vitamin products, which would leave us at a disadvantage. The principal competitive factors in our industry are genetically specific, public taste and diet, pricing and quality of food supplements and vitamins. We will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar food and vitamin products. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large companies, such as Herbalife and Isogenix, will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than we do. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for similar food supplement and vitamin products than us which may also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date.
MARKETING & SALES STRATEGY
 
We plan to train sales persons at our offices in Manila, Philippines. We have already commenced training of approximately 50 sales persons in the Philippines to sell our food supplement and vitamin products directly to consumers at sales events which we plan to host at rented facilities. We also plan to market and sell our products directly from our website www.alphavetures.com

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISE RESTRICTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & CONCESSIONS
 
We have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to, obligations or concessions. We are planning to develop our website and intend to protect its contents by registering for appropriate copyright and trademark protection where our management deems such registration necessary or beneficial. We have not conducted any independent searches or other inquiry into patents or other intellectual property which may be owned by others and which may constrain our business plan, nor have we received independent opinions of counsel on such matters. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property rights.
COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.
 We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business, however, any government regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND COSTS
 We have not incurred any research and development costs to date. We have plans to undertake certain research and development activities during the first 12 months following the date of this prospectus related to the development of our website.
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
 Eleazar Rivera, our sole officer and a director, is our an employee, and he currently works full time on Company matters. Ronie Tan, a director, is also an employee who works fulltime on Company matters. In addition, the Company has 5 full-time employees.
