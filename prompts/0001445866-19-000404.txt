Description of Our Company and Predecessor
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada under the name Castwell Precast Corporation on March 25, 2005. On March 27, 2012, the Company (f/k/a Castwell Precast Corporation), closed the transaction (the “Transaction”) contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Contribution entered into on January 17, 2012 among the Company, Summer LLC, and the individual members of Summer LLC (the “Contribution Agreement”). A copy of the Contribution Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 19, 2012, and the description contained herein of the terms of the Contribution Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions thereof. Further, a more complete description of the Transaction is set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 30, 2012. Prior to the consummation of the Transaction, the Company’s principal business activity, carried out entirely through its wholly-owned subsidiary Castwell Precast Inc., was the manufacture and installation of decorative window wells made from precast concrete. Castwell Precast Inc. was incorporated in the state of Utah on March 24, 2005. The Company ceased the business of manufacturing and installing decorative window wells, and currently conducts the business of purchasing and reselling electric power within the states of Texas, Massachusetts and New Hampshire through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Summer LLC and Summer Northeast. 
Overview
 
Following the Transaction, the Company now carries on, through Summer LLC and Summer Northeast, the business of an REP in the states of Texas, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, with head offices located at 5847 San Felipe Street, Suite 3700, Houston, Texas 77057. The Company’s telephone number is (713) 375-2790, its fax number is (713) 375-2794, and its website is www.summerenergy.com. The information accessible through the Company’s website does not constitute part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report.
 
Summer LLC was organized as a Texas limited liability company on April 6, 2011, by the filing of a certificate of organization with the Texas Secretary of State. In September of 2011, Summer LLC was awarded a license by the PUCT to operate as a REP in Texas. In general, Texas regulatory structure permits REPs, such as Summer LLC, to procure and sell electricity at unregulated prices. All REPs must be certified by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) to operate within the Texas market. In Texas, ERCOT serves as the Independent System Operator (“ISO”) of the power grid and enables REPs, generators, regulated transmission and distribution service providers (“TDSPs”), and ultimately customers, to operate in a deregulated marketplace. ERCOT is responsible for coordinating and monitoring all communications by and between the power generator, the retail electric provider and the TDSP, including customer sign up, meter reading and billing between the end user, power generator and the REP. 
 
Summer Northeast was organized as a Texas limited liability company on December 21, 2007 and was awarded licenses to operate as a REP by the public utility commissions of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. REPs pay the local transmission and distribution utilities a regulated tariff rate for delivering electricity to their customers. As a REP, we sell electricity and provide the related billing, customer service, collections and remittance services to residential and commercial customers. We offer our customers competitive electricity rates, flexible payment and pricing choices, simple offers with understandable terms and responsive customer service. Summer Midwest was organized as an Ohio limited liability company (formerly known as Summer Energy of Ohio, LLC) and has not yet commenced operations.
 
We offer retail electricity to commercial and residential customers in designated target markets within the states of Texas, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In the commercial market, the primary targets are small to medium-sized customers (less than one megawatt of peak usage), but we will also selectively pursue larger commercial customers. Residential customers are a secondary target market. At this time, a majority of our customers are located in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas, although our footprint extends to metropolitan and rural areas.
 
We rely upon established relationships and low-cost branding programs to attract commercial and residential customers. We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our areas of operations as certain market regions elect

to opt-in to deregulation. In addition, we continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire other REPs to the extent these acquisitions would provide value to us.
    In most jurisdictions, we are required to enter into agreements with local transmission and distribution service providers for use of the local distribution and transmission systems and operation of functional interfaces necessary for us to serve our customers. With respect to energy supply, we utilize wholesale purchase agreements with wholesale energy providers. We serve as our own qualified scheduling entity for open market purchases and sales of electricity, forecasting our energy demand, and conducting procurement activities through an experienced team of professionals. The forecast for electricity load requirements is based on our aggregate customer base currently served and anticipated weather conditions, as well as forecasted customer acquisition and attrition. We continuously monitor and update our supply positions based on our retail demand forecasts and market conditions. Our policy is to maintain a balanced supply/demand book to limit commodity risk exposure. At this time, we do not plan on maintaining a financial book in addition to our physical supply/demand book for risk-hedging purposes. 
 
We began delivering electricity to customers in mid-February 2012.  We have continued to experience growth in our customer base since that time.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 81 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.  We believe our employee relations are good.
 
Expansion into New Markets
 
If the Company enters additional deregulated markets, we will be required to operate within the specific regulatory environment of such state or region. We will evaluate the regulatory environment of each market, in addition to other operational, financial and customer considerations, before determining whether to pursue other market area opportunities. 
Principal Supplier
 
Our subsidiaries, Summer LLC and Summer Northeast, are parties to an Energy Services Agreement with EDF Energy Services, LLC and EDF Trading North America, LLC (collectively, “EDF”) whereby, with limited exceptions, they are required to purchase all of their electric power and associated services requirements from EDF. We therefore rely substantially on EDF in order to meet our customers’ needs. 
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company seeks to employ a multi-tiered marketing and sales strategy. The short-term emphasis is on controlled growth, utilizing indirect marketing through third-party relationships. Indirect marketing efforts, including the following, allow the Company to facilitate growth while keeping expenses low by avoiding the expense associated with creating and managing a full sales team: 
 
·
Aggregators, Brokers, Consultants - often referred to as “ABC’s” in the retail power industry;
·
Affinity Programs - Gift card programs; Company-branded product incentives;
·
Multifamily Housing Programs - incentivizing property management companies based on referrals to their tenants;
·
Referrals - reaching out to individuals connected to the community and providing incentives for sign-ups; and
·
Charitable Programs - enhancing referral programs and offering customers the chance to donate referral fees to local charitable organizations.

As the Company grows, we expect to achieve long-term growth by enhancing our indirect marketing efforts as well as growing our residential customer base. These initiatives include or will include, without limitation:
 
·
Releasing an online portal for third parties to manage their commercial pricing requests and customer data

remotely with minimal intervention of sales staff;
 ·
Further business development by strengthening existing and revisiting weakened or less active relationships;
·
Improving efficiency of our sales teams through further IT development and automation;
·
Increasing our pre-paid electric residential segment via online and relationship marketing; and
·
Refining our multi-family marketing division through IT improvements, increased staffing, and onsite marketing support to properties promoting our product.
Direct marketing efforts continue to be a result of management’s existing relationships, direct traffic to our enrollment platform on our website, and customer referrals.
 
Competition and Perceived Competitive Advantages
 
As more fully set forth under the heading entitled “Risk Factors,” the Company faces competition from many competitors who have significantly greater financial resources, well-established brand names, and large, existing installed customer bases. We expect the level of competition to intensify in the future. There is also significant competition from incumbent, traditional, and new electricity providers which may be better capitalized than the Company. 
 
It is understood that there is significant competition in the retail electric market; however, we have observed that most established competitors target the larger customer segment such as large commercial and industrial operations. This creates a niche that we aggressively target. We focus on small to medium size commercial, residential, and select large businesses in our core marketing efforts. We believe this market segment will yield a higher per-unit-margin with improved customer loyalty. 
 
The Company anticipates the addition of new market participants. Recent entries into the marketplace include single-client companies established for a select number of large electricity users such as refineries or industrial plants. These new participants’ strategy is to focus most of their marketing dollars on high-end users, as they assume the larger customers provide the highest return. The Company differentiates its strategy by focusing on the small to mid-size customer segment and building lasting relationships through excellent customer service, flexible terms, unique sales techniques, and competitive pricing. 
 
The Company’s present management and staff have significant experience working in the Texas retail energy market. Management and staff also have experience with REPs who operate in Maryland, New Hampshire, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts. We believe management’s experience with these entities will contribute to management’s ability to market and continue to grow the Company in the markets in which we operate.
 
Because of management’s prior experience, management and staff have developed and maintained strong connections with agents, brokers, property owners and others in the markets in which we operate. Through these relationships, the Company anticipates building sales momentum. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company has not applied for any patents or copyrights. The Company has filed trademark applications for “Summer Energy” and for “Pronto Power.” The Company has not spent any significant time since its inception on research and development activities. 
Additional Information
 
As more fully set forth under the heading entitled “Risk Factors,” the Company is subject to governmental regulation and will face additional costs in complying with such regulations. At this time, the Company does not have an estimate of its annual regulatory compliance costs.
