ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
RH (collectively, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a curator of design, taste and style in the luxury lifestyle market. Our curated and fully integrated assortments are presented consistently across our sales channels in sophisticated and unique lifestyle settings. We offer dominant merchandise assortments across a number of categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, décor, outdoor and garden, and child and teen furnishings. Our retail business is fully integrated across our multiple channels of distribution, consisting of our retail locations, websites and Source Books. We position our Galleries as showrooms for our brand, while our websites and Source Books act as virtual and print extensions of our physical spaces. We operate our retail locations throughout the United States, Canada, and the U.K., and have an integrated RH Hospitality experience in 13 of our Design Gallery locations, which includes Restaurants and Wine Bars.
We have experienced a significant improvement in our business during fiscal 2021 despite the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it has caused in our business operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Our performance demonstrates both the desirability of our exclusive products and our ability to overcome supply chain challenges, including port delays, which impacted our ability to convert business demand into revenues at normal historical rates. We have continued to navigate changes in operational restrictions based upon changes in local conditions and regulations, and as pandemic-related restrictions continue to be lifted in fiscal 2022 we may see consumer spending patterns shift away from spending on the home and home-related categories, such as home furnishings, and consumers return to pre-COVID consumption trends, such as spending on travel and leisure, and other activities. 
For more information, refer to Item 1A—Risk Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant and widespread risks to our business as well as to the business environment and the markets in which we operate and Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.
Key Value-Driving Strategies
In order to drive growth across our business, we are focused on the following long-term key strategies and business initiatives:
Product Elevation. We have built the most comprehensive and compelling collection of luxury home furnishings under one brand in the world. Our products are presented across multiple collections, categories and channels that we control, and their desirability and exclusivity has enabled us to achieve industry-leading revenues and margins. Our customers know our brand concepts as RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Beach House, RH Ski House, RH Outdoor, RH Baby & Child, RH TEEN and Waterworks. Our strategy to elevate the design and quality of our product will continue as we introduce RH Contemporary in 2022. We also have plans to introduce RH Couture Upholstery, RH Bespoke Furniture and RH Color over the next several years.
​
Gallery Transformation. Our product is elevated and rendered more valuable by our architecturally inspiring Galleries. We believe our strategy to open new Design Galleries in every major market will unlock the value of our vast assortment, generating a revenue opportunity for our business of $5 to $6 billion in North America. We believe we can significantly increase our sales by transforming our real estate platform from our existing legacy retail footprint to a portfolio of Design Galleries that is sized to the potential of each market and the size of our assortment. In addition, we plan to incorporate hospitality into most of the new Design Galleries that we open in the future, which further elevates and renders our product and brand more valuable. We believe hospitality has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality drives incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries.

​



Brand Elevation. We are evolving the brand beyond curating and selling product to conceptualizing and selling spaces by building an ecosystem of Products, Places, Services and Spaces designed to elevate and render our product more valuable while establishing the RH brand as a thought leader, taste and place maker. We believe our seamlessly integrated ecosystem of immersive experiences inspires customers to dream, design, dine, travel and live in a world thoughtfully curated by RH, creating an impression and connection unlike any other brand in the world. Our hospitality efforts will continue to elevate the RH brand as we extend beyond the four walls of our Galleries into RH Guesthouses, where our goal is to create a new market for travelers seeking privacy and luxury in the $200 billion North American hotel industry. Additionally, we are creating bespoke experiences like RH Yountville, an integration of Food, Wine, Art & Design in the Napa Valley, RH1 & RH2, our private jets, and RH3, our luxury yacht that is available for charter in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. These immersive experiences expose new and existing customers to our evolving authority in architecture, interior design and landscape architecture. 
​
Digital Reimagination. Our strategy is to digitally reimagine the RH brand and business model both internally and externally. Internally our multi-year effort began with the reimagination of our Center of Innovation & Product Leadership to incorporate digitally integrated visuals and decision data designed to amplify the creative process from product ideation to product presentation. Externally our strategy is designed to come to life digitally as we launch The World of RH, an online portal where customers can explore and be inspired by the depth and dimension of our brand. The World of RH will include rich, immersive content with simplified navigation and search functionality, all designed to enhance the shopping experience and render our product and brand more valuable. We believe an opportunity exists to create similar strategic separation online as we have with our Galleries offline, reconceptualizing what a website can and should be.
​
Global Expansion. We believe that our luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetic have strong international appeal, and that pursuit of global expansion will provide RH a substantial long-term market opportunity to build a $20 to $25 billion global brand over time. Our view is that the competitive environment globally is more fragmented and primed for disruption than the North American market, and there is no direct competitor of scale that possesses the product, operational platform, and brand of RH. As such, we are actively pursuing the expansion of the RH brand globally with the objective of launching international locations in Europe, beginning in 2022 with the opening of RH England, The Gallery at the Historic Aynhoe Park. We have secured a number of locations in various markets in the United Kingdom and continental Europe for future Design Galleries and are in lease or purchase negotiations for additional locations. 
Products and Product Development
We have positioned RH as a lifestyle brand and design authority by offering expansive merchandise assortments. We are merchants of luxury home furnishings and our products embody our design aesthetic and reflect inspiration from across the centuries and around the globe.
We have developed a proprietary product development platform that is fully integrated from ideation to presentation. Key aspects of our product development platform are:
Organization—We have established a collaborative, cross-functional organization leading our product development, sourcing, merchandising, inventory and creative teams. Our product teams are focused on maximizing the sales potential of each product category across all channels, which eliminates channel conflicts and functional redundancies.
Process—For many of our products, we work closely with our network of artisan partners who possess specialized product development and manufacturing capabilities and who we consider an extension of our product development team. We collaborate with our global network of specialty vendors and manufacturers to produce artisanal pieces of high quality and value on a large scale, including both distinctive original designs and reinterpretations of antiques.
Facility—We have built the RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, a facility that supports the entire product development process from product ideation to presentation across all channels.
Our proprietary organization, process and facility enhance our ability to introduce more new products with each collection. In addition, our product development platform, sourcing capabilities and significant scale enable us to reduce our product costs.

Sales Channels
We distribute our products through a fully integrated sales platform comprising our retail locations, including RH Galleries and Waterworks Showrooms, in addition to our websites, Source Books, Trade and Contract, and Outlets. We believe the level of integration among all of our channels and our approach to the market distinguish us from other retailers. We encourage our customers to shop across our channels, which complement one another, and have aligned our business and internal organization to be channel agnostic. 
Retail Locations
As of January 29, 2022, our retail locations comprise RH Galleries and Waterworks Showrooms:

​
Our Galleries reinforce our luxury brand aesthetic and are highly differentiated from other home furnishings retailers. We have revolutionized the customer experience by showcasing products in a sophisticated lifestyle setting, consistent with the imagery and product presentation featured on our websites and in our Source Books. Products in our Galleries are presented in fully appointed rooms, emphasizing collections over individual pieces. This presentation inspires our customers to consider purchasing a full collection of products to replicate the design aesthetic experienced in our Galleries. In addition, our associates use iPads and other devices to allow customers to shop our entire merchandise assortment while in a retail location.
We believe situating our Galleries in desirable locations, such as iconic buildings and luxury retail malls, is critical to the success of our business. New sites are identified based on a variety of store-specific factors – including unique architecture, geographic location, demographics, and proximity to affluent consumers – in addition to our ability to negotiate favorable economic terms and to procure permits and complete construction in a timely manner. We pursue a market-based sales strategy, whereby we assess each market’s overall sales potential and how best to approach the market across all of our channels. We customize square footage, as well as Source Book circulation, to maximize each market’s sales potential and increase our return on invested capital.
We believe our integrated RH hospitality experience, which includes Restaurants and Wine Bars, has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality drives incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries. We plan to incorporate hospitality into most of the new Galleries that we open in the future.
We have identified key learnings from our real estate transformation that have supported the development of a multi-tier market approach described below that we believe will optimize both market share and return on invested capital.

First, we have developed prototype Design Galleries that are innovative and flexible blueprints that enable us to more quickly place our disruptive product assortment and immersive retail experience into the market. The prototype model is a standard we will continue to utilize and innovate based on key learnings from more recent Design Gallery openings. The prototype has approximately 40,000 leased selling square feet, inclusive of our integrated hospitality experience, presents our assortments across our businesses and contains interior design offices and presentation rooms where design professionals can work with clients on their projects. The prototype model is capital efficient and accelerates the development process. Our most recently opened Design Galleries in Dallas, Texas, Oak Brook, Illinois and Jacksonville, Florida are prototype Design Galleries, and an upcoming prototype location includes Palo Alto, California, which is expected to open in the second half of fiscal 2022. We anticipate the prototype Design Galleries will represent the format of most of our upcoming Design Galleries in North America.
Second, we will continue to develop and open larger Bespoke Design Galleries in the top metropolitan markets, similar to those we opened in New York and Chicago. These iconic locations are highly profitable statements for our brand, and we believe they create a long-term competitive advantage that will be difficult to duplicate. We will be opening our Bespoke Design Gallery, RH San Francisco, The Gallery at the Historic Bethlehem Steel Building, in spring 2022 and expect to open additional Bespoke locations in the coming years.
Third, we will continue to open indigenous Bespoke Galleries in the best second-home markets where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. These Galleries are tailored to reflect the local culture and are sized to the potential of each market. Examples of current indigenous Bespoke Galleries include our location in Yountville, California, as well as our Gallery under development in Aspen, Colorado.
The cadence of our Gallery openings depends upon a number of factors. We plan to expand our product sales to additional international markets and have signed leases for Design Galleries in several locations outside of North America, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

(1) | The London retail location is a Waterworks Showroom.
----+-----------------------------------------------------

We continually analyze opportunities to selectively consolidate retail locations in connection with openings of our Design Galleries or close retail locations that have been under-performing or are no longer consistent with our brand positioning. In many cases, we continue to operate a retail location until our lease has expired in order to effect the closure in a cost-efficient manner.
Websites
Our primary RH websites, www.rh.com, www.rhmodern.com, www.rhbabyandchild.com and www.rhteen.com, provide our customers with the ability to chat with a designer and purchase our merchandise online. We sell Waterworks products online through www.waterworks.com.
Our websites allow our customers to experience the unique lifestyle settings reflected in our Source Books and throughout our Galleries and Showrooms, and to shop all of our current product assortment. We update our websites regularly to reflect new products, product availability and occasional special offers.
The RH websites also offer room-based navigation, which allows the customer to envision and shop items by room or by product, expanding on the richness of the online experience. Customers can search the websites for products by size or color, browse through our extensive product categories and see detailed information about each item and collection, such as dimensions, materials and care instructions. Additionally, customers can select color swatches and view merchandise displayed with different color and fabric options.
Source Books
We produce a series of catalogs, which we refer to as Source Books, to showcase our merchandise assortment. Our Source Books include RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Outdoor, RH Baby & Child and TEEN, RH Beach House, RH Ski House and RH Rugs. Additionally, we plan to launch the RH Contemporary Source Book in fiscal 2022. Our Source Books are one of our primary branding and advertising vehicles. We have found that merchandise assortments displayed in our Source Books contribute to increased sales of those products across all of our channels. As in our Galleries, our Source Books present our merchandise in lifestyle settings that reflect our unique design aesthetic. Our Source Books also feature profiles of select artisan vendors and other compelling editorial content regarding home décor. All creative work on our Source Books is coordinated in-house in our RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, providing us greater control over the brand image presented to our customers, while also reducing our Source Book production costs.

​



Our Source Book mailings serve as a key driver of sales through both our retail locations and websites. Our customers respond to the Source Books across all of our channels, with sales trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently in our Source Books, websites and Galleries. Our Source Books, in concert with our websites, are a cost-effective means to test new products, and allow us to launch categories in a disciplined, expeditious and cost-effective manner. We continue to evaluate and optimize our Source Book strategy based on our experience.
We maintain a database of customer information, including information from our RH Members Program. Our customer database includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information and certain demographic information, as well as mailing and email addresses. We mail our Source Books to addresses within this database and to addresses provided to us by third parties. The database, which is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy disclosed on our website, supports our ability to analyze our customers’ buying behaviors across sales channels, facilitates the development of targeted marketing strategies, and supports prospecting new customers. We segment our customer files based on multiple variables, and we tailor our Source Book mailings and emails in response to the purchasing patterns and product needs of our customers. We continue to improve the segmentation of customer files and the expansion of our customer database.
Trade and Contract
In the Trade channel, we work directly with residential interior designers and decorators purchasing products for their clients’ residential projects. We also sell directly to consumers who make purchases with the assistance of their residential interior designer or decorator. Our Contract business supplies products to large-scale, luxury hospitality, commercial and residential development projects globally, working directly with hotel ownership groups and brands, commercial property owners, single-family and multi-family builders and developers and their ecosystem of architecture, interior design and purchasing business partners. These channels enable us to reach new business customers and the consumers they influence.
Outlet Stores
Our outlet stores are branded as RH Outlet or Restoration Hardware Outlet and are typically located in outlet malls. Our outlet stores serve as a key part of our reverse logistics platform and provide an efficient means to sell primarily returned merchandise and, to a lesser extent, discontinued and overstock merchandise outside of our core sales channels. As of January 29, 2022, we operated 38 outlet stores.
Marketing and Advertising
Our Galleries, websites and Source Books are the primary branding and advertising vehicles for the RH brands. In addition, we employ a variety of marketing and advertising techniques to drive customer traffic across all our channels, strengthen and reinforce our brand image and acquire new customers. These include targeted Source Book circulation, email communications, promotional mailings, print advertisements, and public relations activities and events. We use our customer database to tailor our programs and increase the efficiency of our marketing and promotion initiatives. We leverage our marketing and advertising expenses across all our channels as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our investment.
The highly differentiated design aesthetic and environment of our Galleries drives customer traffic not only to our physical spaces but also to our websites. Our Source Books and targeted emails further reinforce the RH brand image and drive sales across all of our sales channels. We also participate in a wide range of other marketing, promotional and public relations activities. These campaigns include media coverage in design, lifestyle, culture/society and specialty publications, as well as in-Gallery events related to new Gallery openings and product launches. In addition, we engage in print advertising in brand-relevant publications such as Architectural Digest, Elle Décor, Luxe Interiors + Designs, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, WSJ. Magazine, Business of Home and others. We believe that these efforts drive increased brand awareness, leading to higher sales over time.
RH Members Program
The RH Members Program reimagines and simplifies the shopping experience. For an annual fee, the RH Members Program provides a set discount every day across all RH brands, excluding RH Hospitality and Waterworks, in addition to other benefits including complimentary interior design services through the RH Interior Design program and eligibility for preferred financing plans on the RH Credit Cards. The RH Members Program allows our customers to shop for what they want, when they want, and receive the greatest value, which has resulted in orders and sales being more evenly distributed throughout the year. During fiscal 2021, our members drove approximately 97% of sales in our core RH business, and we had approximately 459,000 members at year end. Our core RH business reflects the product categories that the membership discount can be applied to, and, as a result, sales generated via Outlet, Contract, Hospitality or Waterworks are excluded. We believe our membership model enhances the customer experience, renders our brand more valuable, improves operational execution and reduces costs.

Sourcing
Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and using vendors that can provide the quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. We work closely with vendors and manufacturers to ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met. We seek to ensure the consistent quality of our manufacturers’ products by selectively inspecting pre-production samples, conducting periodic site visits to certain of our vendors’ production facilities and selectively inspecting inbound shipments at our distribution facilities. In fiscal 2021, we sourced approximately 75% of our purchase dollar volume from approximately 29 vendors. In fiscal 2021, one vendor accounted for 11% of our purchase dollar volume. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2021, 69% of our products were sourced from Asia, with 34% sourced from China, 15% from the United States and the remainder from other countries and regions. In addition, we perform limited manufacturing activities in the United States.
We have a limited number of long-term merchandise supply contracts, but we believe that we generally have strong relationships with our product vendors. Although we transact business primarily on an order-by-order basis, we typically work with most of our vendors over extended periods of time, and many vendors continue to make long-term capacity investments to serve our increasing demands. We develop close relationships with our vendors in order to achieve significant cost savings and improve our product development process by eliminating the use of most third-party purchasing agents in favor of a model in which we directly manage our vendors.
Distribution and Delivery
We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our distribution centers. We currently operate three furniture fulfillment centers and one small-parcel fulfillment center servicing RH products, which are located strategically in four markets throughout the United States. We have one fulfillment center in the United States servicing Waterworks products. In addition, we continue to develop our supply chain in the U.K. and Europe in connection with our global expansion and plan to use third-party providers to serve our customers.
We operate portions of our home delivery services in 22 key markets to leverage operating costs and improve our customers’ delivery experience, while reducing returns and damage to our products. We offer a white glove home delivery service for our larger merchandise and furniture categories, where third-party personnel deliver fully assembled items to the location of our customers’ choice. We believe there is an opportunity to improve the customer experience by taking greater control of the home delivery experience over time. We believe that many third-party furniture delivery providers are designed to support mass and mid-market companies and that significant opportunity exists for developing improved solutions for the luxury market. We believe we have dramatically enhanced the customer experience while reducing return rates, damages and deliveries per order by enhancing the quality of our delivery providers through metric-based accountability standards. 
We believe our supply chain and fulfillment operations allow us to manage customer orders and distribute merchandise to our customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
Competition
The home furnishings sector is highly competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of the design, style and quality of our products, the breadth of our assortment of high-quality merchandise and the luxury positioning of our brand. We believe that customers respond favorably to the style and presentation of our products and that we offer consumers a substantial assortment of curated merchandise selections as part of a lifestyle experience. We continue to elevate our product assortment and create separation between our brand and that of many of our competitors. 
We compete with the interior design trade and specialty stores, as well as antique dealers and other merchants that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at higher price points, by providing a broader product assortment at an exceptional value based both upon the price and quality of our products. We also compete with national and regional home furnishing retailers and department stores, in addition to mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings, by offering what we believe is superior quality, highly distinctive design styles and a sophisticated lifestyle presentation in our product offering. 
We also believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate and define product trends, as well as to timely anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. However, many smaller specialty retailers may lack the financial resources, infrastructure, scale and national brand identity necessary to compete effectively with us. We believe we are positioned to gain market share from both of these segments and drive growth.

Our People
At RH, we believe deeply that the “right” people are our greatest asset. As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately 6,500 associates, of which approximately 800 were part-time associates. As of that date, approximately 2,300 of our associates were based in our retail locations and outlets. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that relations with our associates are good.
The success of our business depends upon our ability to retain continued service of certain key personnel, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Friedman, and to attract, retain and motivate qualified leaders throughout our Company, as well as qualified associates across all parts of our organization, including Galleries, Restaurants, distribution centers, home delivery centers and customer care centers, both in the United States and internationally. Our goal is to have the most qualified person in every position throughout our organization. As we are headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, a highly dynamic and competitive market for talent, we seek to provide competitive compensation for our people in order to attract and retain the best available talent.
We do not discriminate against any applicant or associate and have a policy outlining these principles. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, discipline, job assignments, benefits, transfer and discharge. We maintain a diverse workforce. RH is an equal opportunity employer, and we believe in meritocratic hiring. We strongly believe our performance is enhanced by a workforce comprising individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience that align with the needs of our business. We are committed to operating our environments with the highest safety standards to ensure the health and well-being of our guests and team members. 
Our culture is driven by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the senior leadership team, who instill a company-wide commitment to our values of People, Quality, Service and Innovation. We believe our distinct corporate culture allows us to attract highly talented individuals who are passionate, driven and who share our vision. We expect our values to be maintained throughout our business, including our supply chain. We require our vendors to adhere to our Vendor Code of Conduct, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, located at ir.rh.com under “Governance / Environmental, Social & Governance.”

The “RH,” “Restoration Hardware,” “RH Interiors,” “RH Modern,” “RH Outdoor,” “RH Baby & Child,” “RH TEEN,” “RH Beach House,” “RH Ski House,” “RH Rugs” and “Waterworks,” and “Waterworks Studio” trademarks, among others, are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Each of our trademark registrations is perpetually renewable provided that we use or continue to use the trademarks in commerce in the particular geographic market and for the goods or services covered by the registration. In addition, we own many domain names, including “rh.com,” “restorationhardware.com,” “rhmodern.com,” “rhbabyandchild.com,” “rhteen.com,” “rhbeachouse.rh.com,” “rhskihouse.rh.com,” “waterworks.com” and others that include our trademarks. These domain names are perpetually renewable. We own design patents or pending design patent applications to protect the ornamental appearance of several of our products. These design patents are valid for 15 years from their date of issuance. We own copyrights, including copyright registrations or pending applications, for our website and for several of our Source Books. We believe that our trademarks, design patents, and copyrights have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement.
Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
Our quarterly results vary depending upon a variety of factors, including changes in our product offerings and the introduction of new merchandise assortments and categories, changes in retail locations, the timing of Source Book releases, and the extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of our numerous strategic initiatives, among other things. For example, we have historically experienced some seasonality in our business trends as our sales are typically higher in the second fiscal quarter, which correlates to a peak selling season for outdoor items including outdoor furniture. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands may fluctuate during the year. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year.
Corporate Information
The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on August 18, 2011. On November 7, 2012, the Company completed an initial public offering. On December 15, 2016, Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change its name to “RH,” effective January 1, 2017.
