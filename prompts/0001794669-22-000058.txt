ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
We are a leading independent provider of payment acceptance and payment processing technology solutions in the United States based on total volume of payments processed. We have achieved our leadership position through decades of solving business and operational challenges facing our customers overall commerce needs. We distribute our services through our network of software partners (“ISVs”) and value-added resellers (“VARs”). For our software partners, we offer a single integration to an end-to-end payments offering, a proprietary gateway and a robust suite of technology solutions to enhance the value of their software and simplify payment acceptance. For our merchant customers, we provide a seamless, unified consumer experience as an alternative to relying on multiple providers to accept card-based and digital payments, while providing the digital tools necessary to provide their end-customers a seamless commerce experience.
Merchants are increasingly adopting disparate software solutions and new digital tools to operate their business and remain competitive. The complexity of conducting commerce across these software suites has created an enormous challenge for card-accepting merchants. For example, a small business in the United States may use over a dozen disparate software systems to operate its business, manage interactions with its customers and accept payments. A large resort may operate an even greater number of software systems to enable online reservations, check-ins, restaurants, salon and spa, golf, parking and more. The scale and complexity of managing these software systems that are sourced from different providers while seamlessly accepting payments is challenging for merchants of any size.
Our software partners are also required to ensure that their solutions are integrated with a variety of applications to service merchants. For example, any software partner seeking to be adopted in a resort, such as an online reservation system or restaurant POS, must be able to integrate into that resort’s property management systems. These software integrations need to enable secure payment acceptance and also support additional services to manage the guest’s experience. Facilitating these integrations is both costly and time-consuming for software partners.
We integrate disparate software systems through a single point of connectivity. By partnering with us, every software provider receives the benefit of both a state-of-the-art payments platform and our library of over 425 established integrations with market-leading software suites. In turn, our merchants are able to simplify payment acceptance and streamline their business operations by reducing the number of vendors on which they rely.
At the heart of our business is our payments platform. Our payments platform is a full suite of integrated payment products and services that can be used across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and tablet-based) and industry verticals, including:
•end-to-end payment processing for a broad range of payment types;
•merchant acquiring;
•proprietary omni-channel gateway capable of multiple methods of mobile, contactless and QR code-based payments;
•complementary software integrations;
•full eCommerce capabilities, including web-store design, hosting, shopping cart management and fulfillment integrations;
•integrated and mobile point of sale (“POS”) solutions;
•security and risk management solutions; and
•reporting and analytical tools.
In addition, we offer innovative technology solutions that go beyond payment processing. Some of our solutions are developed in-house, such as business intelligence and POS software, while others are powered by our network of complementary third-party applications. Our focus on innovation combined with our product-driven culture enables us to create scalable technology solutions that benefit from an extensive library of intellectual property.
We have a partner-centric distribution approach. We market and sell our solutions through a diversified network of over 7,000 software partners, which consists of ISVs and VARs. ISVs are technology providers that develop commerce-enabling software suites with which they can bundle our payments platform. VARs are organizations that provide distribution support for ISVs and act as trusted and localized service providers to merchants by providing them with software and services. Together, our ISVs and VARs provide us immense distribution scale and provide our merchants with front-line service and support.
Our merchants range from small to medium size businesses (“SMBs”), to large enterprises across numerous verticals including food and beverage, hospitality, stadiums and arenas, gaming, specialty retail, non-profits and eCommerce. Over 185,000 of the customers that rely on our technology are SMBs. In addition, our merchant base is highly diversified with no single merchant representing more than 1% of end-to-end payment volume for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
We derive the majority of our revenue from fees paid by our merchants, which principally include a processing fee that is charged as a percentage of end-to-end payment volume. In cases where merchants subscribe only to our gateway, we generate revenue from transaction fees charged in the form of a fixed fee per transaction and a monthly fee. We also generate subscription revenue from licensing subscriptions to our POS software, business intelligence tools, payment device management and other technology solutions, for which we typically charge flat subscription fees on a monthly basis. Our revenue is recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the solutions we provide and the high switching costs associated with these solutions. We also benefit from a high degree of operating leverage given the combination of our highly scalable payments platform and strong customer unit economics.
Our total revenue was $1,367.5 million, $766.9 million and $731.4 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated net losses of $74.0 million, $111.4 million and $56.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our gross revenue less network fees was $529.0 million, $323.0 million and $305.5 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 63.8% from 2020 to 2021 and 5.7% from 2019 to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross revenue less network fees excludes the impact of the payments to merchants, included in “Gross revenue,” and payments to partners and associated expenses due to the TSYS outage, included in “Network fees” and “Other costs of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These are nonrecurring payments that occurred outside of our day-to-day operations, and we have excluded them in order to provide more useful information to investors in the evaluation of our performance period-over-period. The percentage of our total gross revenue less network fees derived from volume-based payments, subscription agreements and transaction fees was 61.9%, 18.8% and 13.0% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, 60.6%, 23.6% and 13.8% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, and 56.7%, 26.5% and 14.6% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.
Our Adjusted EBITDA was $167.2 million, $87.7 million and $89.8 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a year-over-year change of 90.6% from 2020 to 2021 and (2.3)% from 2019 to 2020. Effective June 30, 2020, we modified the terms and conditions of our software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) arrangements and updated our operational procedures. As a result, the majority of our hardware provided to our merchants is accounted for as an operating lease, whereby the cost of the equipment is included in investing activities when purchased and the depreciation of the equipment under lease is included in operating activities. Prior to June 30, 2020, this hardware was treated as a sales-type lease, in which the hardware was expensed when shipped and included in operating activities. To provide comparability, if this equipment had been accounted for as an operating lease for the period January 1, 2020 through June 29, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been higher by $8.6 million. If this equipment had been accounted for as an operating lease for the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been higher by $14.0 million.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures” for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Our Shift4 Model
Our mission is to power the convergence of integrated payments and commerce-enabling software. Solving the complexity inherent to our software partners and merchants requires a specialized approach that combines a seamless customer experience with a secure, reliable and robust suite of payments and technology offerings.
To achieve this mission, we strategically built our Shift4 Model on a three pillar foundation: (i) payments platform; (ii) technology solutions; and (iii) partner-centric distribution.
Payments Platform
Our payments platform provides omni-channel card acceptance and processing solutions across multiple payment types, including credit, debit, contactless card, EMV, QR Pay, and mobile wallets as well as alternative payment methods such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay and WeChat Pay. We continue to innovate and evolve our payments offering as new technology and payment methods are adopted by consumers.
Through our proprietary gateway, our payments platform is integrated with over 425 software suites including some of the largest and most recognized software providers in the world. In addition, we enable connectivity with the largest payment processors, alternative payment rails and many different payment devices. Our payments platform includes market-leading security features that help prevent consumer card data from entering the merchant’s environment.
We designed our payments platform to be:
•Integrated – fully integrated and seamlessly connected, facilitating easy data capture and compatibility across all solutions;
•Reliable – supports the most demanding payment environments in the United States 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; and
•Secure – PCI-validated P2PE tokenization and EMV-ready solutions.
Our merchants have the flexibility to utilize our payments platform in one of two ways: as a gateway or as an end-to-end payment solution. End-to-end payments merchants benefit from a single, unified vendor solution for payment acceptance, devices, POS software solutions and a full suite of business intelligence tools. By consolidating these functions through a single, unified vendor solution, these merchants are able to reduce total spend on payment acceptance solutions and access gateway and technology solutions as value-added features. Gateway merchants benefit from interoperability with third-party payment processors.
Technology Solutions
Our suite of technology solutions is designed to streamline our customers’ business operations, drive growth through strong consumer engagement and improve their business using rich transaction-level data.
•VenueNext - Our mobile-first technology solution provides stadium and entertainment venues with a frictionless commerce experience. Our VenueNext solutions include mobile ordering, countertop point-of-sale, self-service kiosk, and digital wallet to facilitate food and beverage, merchandise, and loyalty all within a white-labeled technology application that is fully integrated with our secure end-to-end payment processing platform. 
•Shift4Shop – Our turnkey eCommerce platform provides everything a merchant needs to build their business online. Merchants can create a webstore in minutes and choose from over one hundred design themes. Shift4Shop also provides merchants with tools to manage their product catalog, order fulfillment and inventory management, search-engine-optimization (“SEO”) and secure hosting.
•Lighthouse – Our cloud-based suite of business intelligence tools includes customer engagement, social media management, online reputation management, scheduling and product pricing, as well as extensive reporting and analytics.
•SkyTab hybrid-cloud-based Integrated Point-of-Sale (“iPOS”) – We provide purpose-built POS workstations pre-loaded with powerful, mission-critical software suites and integrated payment functionality for our restaurant and stadium clients. Our SkyTab iPOS offering helps our merchants scale their business and improve operational efficiency while reducing total cost of ownership.
•Mobile POS – Our mobile payments offering, SkyTab Mobile, provides a complete feature set, including pay-at-the-table, order-at-the-table, delivery, customer feedback and email marketing, all of which are integrated with our proprietary gateway and Lighthouse. This unique solution is relevant for merchants ranging from SMBs to large enterprises and across numerous industry verticals.
•Marketplace – We enable seamless integrations into complementary third-party applications, which helps reduce the number of vendors on which our merchants rely. For example, a restaurant can enable DoorDash via Marketplace and accept orders from their existing POS, dramatically simplifying implementation and eliminating manual reconciliation of multiple systems. That same restaurant can also enable payroll, timekeeping and other human resource services, reducing the time spent on manual workflows and enhancing employee engagement. Marketplace also includes a variety of functional applications including loyalty and inventory management.
Partner-Centric Distribution
•Our payments platform and technology solutions are delivered to our merchants through our partner-centric distribution network. Today, our network includes over 7,000 software partners, providing full coverage across the United States.
•Our partner-centric distribution approach is designed to leverage the domain expertise and local relationships that our software partners have built with our merchants over years of doing business together. Our software partners are entrusted by merchants to guide software purchasing decisions and provide service and support. In turn, our software partners entrust us to provide innovative payment and technology solutions to help them continue to grow.
•We have always been deeply committed to supporting the growth of our software partners with a robust suite of tools, dedicated personnel and strategic and economic alignment. Our partner tools include: lead management, sales and marketing support, real-time pipeline alerts, transaction level residual reporting and merchant life-cycle reporting. Our partner-centric distribution approach provides us with strong merchant growth and retention.
Sales and Distribution
Our partner-centric distribution approach and commitment to our software partners are the foundation of our go-to-market strategy. We have built an extensive distribution network of over 7,000 software partners including both ISVs and VARs.
•Independent software vendors – Our solutions are connected into over 425 integrations with market-leading software providers, including some of the largest and most recognizable technology companies in the world. By integrating our payments platform into their software suites, our ISVs are able to sell a comprehensive solution to the merchant at an attractive price point.
•Value added resellers – We partner with VARs to sell our solutions to merchants. Our VARs include third-party resellers and organizations that provide distribution support for ISVs. VARs act as trusted and localized service providers to our merchants by providing them with software and services. This partnership enables us to expand our reach and scalability by allowing a VAR to bundle our full payments and technology product suite with other value-added services provided by the VAR.
We are selective in identifying and choosing our software partners, and we seek to align our business objectives with those that have strong networks, local expertise, high-quality merchant portfolios and a trusted brand name. Our network of software partners provides a consistent and extensive source of new merchant acquisition, with no single relationship accounting for more than 5% of our end-to-end volume as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we leverage our Shift4 Model to create strategic and economic alignment with our partners to incentivize them to continue working with us.
Our compelling value proposition enables our software partners to extend attractive pricing arrangements to our merchants. For merchants that subscribe to our end-to-end payments offering, our software partners can offer gateway and technology solutions as value-added features included in the price of our payments offering. We believe that enabling our software partners to provide a cost-effective and comprehensive bundle of solutions best supports their ability to sell our solutions and grow their businesses.

Operations and Support Services
Our operations infrastructure is designed to deliver high-quality experiences to our customers and to drive efficiencies throughout the entire payment ecosystem. We leverage our over 30 years of operating history in the hospitality sector and our domain expertise to ensure our obligations to our customers are maintained and fulfilled effectively. Our operations and support services include:
Merchant Operations and Support
•Merchant underwriting – Our merchant underwriting team manages applications and risk evaluation of new merchants. Our merchant base operates in end markets with high card-present volume and low levels of fraud and chargeback losses. In addition, our underwriting strategy offers merchants with a low risk profile expedited activation which enhances their customer experience.
•Merchant onboarding and activation – A business owner can enroll for a merchant account within minutes via our web based portal within Shift4Shop. For enterprises, our merchant onboarding and activation team works closely with our partners to ensure a high-touch transition from sales to implementation and activation. Our streamlined activation and automated approval process enables fast and frictionless merchant onboarding, providing us and our partners with enhanced speed-to-market. Our partners are typically able to board even the largest and most complex merchants within 24 hours of submitting an application.
•Merchant training – We provide a full curriculum of training materials to our merchants via a dedicated training department and content delivery platform.
•Merchant risk management – Our risk management operations are designed to monitor merchant accounts on an on-going basis. This includes dedicated security and regulatory support such as PCI compliance support, vulnerability scanning, system monitoring and breach assistance. Once a merchant is activated, our systems are configured to automatically monitor any activity that may require additional diligence, which in turn helps minimize losses associated with fraud and default.
•Merchant support – Our merchant support team responds to inquiries from merchants 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The team provides customer support for systems integrations and other technical solutions. In addition, we have a dedicated team of merchant account specialists that guide merchants through the payment acceptance process from onboarding to settlement and reporting. With strong emphasis on first-call resolution, we seek to provide exceptional payment expertise and support for our merchants. We train our customer support team to quickly identify and resolve each matter in an empathetic and professional manner which reduces repeat calls and improves our operational efficiency.
Software Partner Operations and Support
•Software integrations and compliance management – We have a team of engineers and technical support staff dedicated to support software integrations and ensure compliance with all card brand, security and regulatory requirements, including PCI and Payment Application Data Security Standard compliance support, system integration and configuration guidance.
•Partner support – We have dedicated support teams who work with our software providers to address any questions or issues that may pertain to the integration of our products and solutions into their software suites. We seek to deliver end-to-end issue resolution by bringing all appropriate disciplines together in an integrated manner, in order to optimize partner support. In addition, we help resolve issues that may pertain to our partners’ entire portfolio of merchants or incidents pertaining to a single merchant.
•Partner services – Through our partner-facing customer relationship management system, our partners are able to track each step of the activation process of their new merchant accounts in real-time. Through this system, our partners can track their merchant portfolio, including commissions, residual payments and even support calls/recordings, in an accurate and real-time manner. We have added substantial automation to these processes, which is essential to ensure optimal experience as well as financial efficiency.
Competition
We compete with a range of providers, each of whom may provide a component of our offering, but do not provide an integrated offering capable of solving complex business challenges for software partners and merchants. For certain services and solutions, including end-to-end payments, we compete with third-party payment processors (such as Chase Paymentech, Elavon, FIS, Fiserv and Global Payments) and integrated payment providers (such as Adyen, Lightspeed POS, Shopify, Square and Toast). For our hospitality gateway offering, we compete primarily with Fusebox (a division of Elavon) and FreedomPay.
While competitive factors and their relative importance can vary based on size, industry and geographic reach of software partners and merchants, we believe we compete primarily on the basis of reputation, domain expertise, scale of distribution channels, breadth of offerings, simplicity and ease-of-use of solutions, pace of innovation, price, data security and customer service. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors.
For information on risks relating to increased competition in our industry, see “Risk Factors—Business risks—Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the financial services, payments and payment technology industries may adversely affect our overall business and operations,” “Risk Factors—Business risks— Potential changes in competitive landscape, including disintermediation from other participants in the payments chain, could harm our business,” and “Risk Factors—Business risks— Our ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry trends and the needs and preferences of our merchants and consumers may adversely affect our competitiveness or the demand for our products and services.”
Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual rights to protect our proprietary software and our brands. We have registered or applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States and several other countries. In addition, we have obtained or applied for patents in the United States and certain foreign countries on certain material aspects of our proprietary software applications. We also license intellectual property from third parties, including software that is incorporated in or bundled with our proprietary software applications. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with both our employees and third parties.
We hold approximately 32 issued United States utility patents, four issued Canadian patents, one issued Mexican patent and one issued European patent related to our proprietary payments technologies. As of December 31, 2021, we also held five pending United States utility patent applications related to our payment technologies. If the United States and foreign patents currently issued to us are maintained until the end of their terms, they will expire between the year 2026 and the year 2032. The expiration of these patents is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we own a portfolio of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world and are in the process of registering for our primary mark, Shift4 Payments.
Seasonality
Our operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality based on historic patterns of consumer and business traveler spending behaviors coupled with exposure to seasonality experienced by our mix of merchants. In the past, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly revenue with revenue typically strongest in our second and third quarters and weakest in our first quarter. Other factors influencing our quarterly seasonality include the timing of specific holidays in a given fiscal year, the number of business days in a month or quarter, and the proportion of our volume derived from various merchant businesses.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business and service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. Certain of our services also are subject to rules promulgated by various card networks and other authorities, as more fully described below. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations and rules frequently change and are increasing in number.
The Dodd-Frank Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate consumer financial products and services (including some offered by our partners). The CFPB may also have authority over us as a provider of services to regulated financial institutions in connection with consumer financial products.
Separately, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve to regulate debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, debit interchange transaction fees must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing, and settling the transaction. Pursuant to the regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve implementing this “reasonable and proportional” requirement, debit interchange rates for card issuers operating in the United States with assets of $10 billion or more are capped at the sum of $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. In addition, the regulations contain non-exclusivity provisions that ban debit card networks from prohibiting an issuer from contracting with any other card network that may process an electronic debit transaction involving an issuer’s debit cards and prohibit card issuers and card networks from inhibiting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any network that can process the transaction.
Further, the ability of payment networks to impose certain restrictions are limited because the Dodd-Frank Act allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (while federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education may set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards). Depending on the card network rules, merchants are now also allowed to provide discounts or other incentives to entice consumers to pay with an alternative payment method, such as cash, checks, or debit cards. However, merchants cannot impose any additional charges for the use of credit cards.
Association and network rules
We are subject to the rules of American Express, Discover, Interlink, Maestro, Mastercard, Visa and other payment networks. In order to provide our services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as service providers with the payment networks that we utilize. Because we are not a “member bank” as defined in certain of the payment networks’ rules, we are not eligible for primary membership in certain payment networks and are therefore unable to directly access them. Instead, those payment networks require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider, which we have accomplished through a sponsorship agreement with our sponsor bank. We are registered with Visa, Mastercard and other networks as service providers for member institutions. As such, we are subject to applicable card association and payment network rules, which impose various requirements and could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by such associations and/or networks for certain acts or omissions. Our failure to comply with the networks’ requirements, or to pay the fees or fines they may impose, could result in the suspension or termination of our sponsorship by our sponsor bank or our registration with the relevant payment network(s), and therefore require us to limit or cease providing the relevant payment processing services.
Card associations and payment networks and their member financial institutions regularly update and generally expand security expectations and requirements related to the security of cardholder data and environments. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association relating to payment transactions processed by us using the Automated Clearing House Network and to various state federal and foreign laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions.
Privacy and information security regulations
We provide services that may be subject to various state, federal, and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including, among others, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which we refer to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the GDPR, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada. These laws and their implementing regulations restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Certain federal, state and foreign laws and regulations impose similar privacy obligations and, in certain circumstances, obligations to notify affected individuals, state officers or other governmental authorities, the media, and consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies, of security breaches affecting personal information. In addition, there are state and foreign laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers.
As a processor of personal data of EU data subjects, we are also subject to regulation and oversight in the applicable EU Member States with regard to data protection legislation. In May 2018, the GDPR, a new European wide Regulation on data privacy came into force. The GDPR contains additional obligations on data controllers and data processors that have an establishment in the EU or are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, consumers within the EU. The GDPR includes significant enhancements with regard to the rights of data subjects (which include the right to be forgotten and the right of data portability), stricter regulation on obtaining consent to processing of personal data and sensitive personal data, stricter obligations with regard to the information to be included in privacy notices and significant enhanced requirements with regard to compliance, including a regime of “accountability” for processors and controllers and a requirement to embed compliance with GDPR into the fabric of an organization by developing appropriate policies and practices, to achieve a standard of data protection by “design and default.” The GDPR includes enhanced data security obligations, requiring data processors and controllers to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data they process and their systems. Organizations that process significant amounts of data may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer responsible for reporting to highest level of management within the business. There are greatly enhanced sanctions under GDPR for failing to comply with the core principles of the GDPR or failing to secure data.
Unfair trade practice regulations
We, our partners and certain of our merchants are subject to various federal, state, and international laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAPs”) under the Dodd-Frank Act. Various regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (“CFPB”) and state attorneys general, have authority to take action against parties that engage in unfair or deceptive trade practices or violate other laws, rules, and regulations, and to the extent we are processing payments for a client that may be in violation of laws, rules, and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. For example, all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers, directly or indirectly, can be subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs. The CFPB has enforcement authority to prevent an entity that offers or provides consumer financial services or products or a service provider from committing or engaging in UDAAPs, including the ability to engage in joint investigations with other agencies, issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands, conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings, commence a civil action, grant relief (e.g., limit activities or functions; rescission of contracts), and refer matters for criminal proceedings.
Anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, sanctions, and counter-terrorist regulations
We are contractually required to comply with the anti-money laundering laws and regulations in certain countries. In the United States, we comply with certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations (collectively “the BSA”) which are enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and other laws, that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures and includes anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the SEC. The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Many other jurisdictions where we conduct business also have similar anticorruption laws and regulations. We have policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations.
We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Other group entities may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions.
Similar anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. Our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations.
Human Capital
In order to continue to innovate, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Shift4 a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and with programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,732 full-time employees. We also employed 21 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Health, Safety and Wellness The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, tools and resources to support physical and mental health and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors. Our benefit programs are designed to offer choice, where possible, so our employees can customize their benefits to meet their and their families’ needs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate, and which comply with relevant local regulations, including by:
•Providing our employees with remote working flexibility, including by adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
•Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
•Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
•Establishing new physical distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite;
•Providing personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
•Modifying work spaces with plexiglass dividers and touchless faucets;
•Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure; and
•Requiring masks to be worn in all locations where allowed by local law.
Compensation and Benefits We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. Our equity incentive plans provide for grants of awards including restricted stock units (“RSUs”). We believe our equity incentive plans foster a stronger sense of ownership and align our employees’ interests with the interests and growth of the Company. In addition to base compensation and awards granted pursuant to equity incentive plans, we offer benefits including a 401(k) Plan and matching, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs. With respect to our 401(k) Plan and matching policy, we match 100% of contributions up to 3% of the employee’s base salary, and for employee contributions ranging from 3.01%-6% of base salary, we match of 100% of 401(k) Plan contributions in the form of RSU's, a third of which vest each subsequent year and which are subject to continued employment.
Building Connections — With Each Other and our Communities We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteer opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our reach to food and hospitality merchants across the country, we launched the Shift4Cares.com website as a way to help merchants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. Throughout our offices, employee-led Employee Activity Committees select local organizations to support. We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees.
In addition, we have a Corporate Social Responsibility program, pursuant to which we have provided structure around our various volunteer and outreach programs across the country led by our Vice President of People and Culture and our Director of Diversity & Inclusion. With the support of executive management, this program is driven by our employees and includes company-wide events that cover many aspects of community, environmental, and volunteer support. 
Diversity & Inclusion Shift4 is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our company culture is the result of our behaviors, our personal commitments, our curiosity, how we collaborate, and the ways that we courageously share our perspectives and encourage others to do the same. 
We believe that our focus on diversity & inclusion helps us boost employee satisfaction, exceed customer expectations, and meet our growth objectives. In 2022, we launched 4 Employee Inclusion Networks, through which we aim to empower and inspire our employees, particularly those who are women, LGBTQIA+, remote workers and veterans. We believe that diversity & inclusion initiatives, such as this, expand our talent acquisition recruitment efforts, increase retention of our diverse workforce and maintain a sense of belonging amongst employees.
Recruitment In 2020, we built an in-house talent and recruitment department. We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent.
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, and innovative work to attract talent to our Company. We empower our employees to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions.
