Item 1. Business
Avnet, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a leading global technology distributor and solutions provider that has served customers’ evolving needs for more than a century. Avnet supports customers at each stage of a product’s lifecycle, from idea to design and from prototype to production. Avnet’s position at the center of the technology value chain enables it to accelerate the design and supply stages of product development so customers can realize revenue faster. Founded in 1921, the Company works with suppliers in every major technology segment to serve customers in more than 140 countries.
Avnet serves a wide range of customers: from startups and mid-sized businesses to enterprise-level original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers, and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). 
Organizational Structure
Avnet has two primary operating groups — Electronic Components (“EC”) and Farnell (“Farnell”). Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: (i) the Americas, (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia/Pacific (“Asia”). Each operating group has its own management team, who manage various functions within each operating group. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting to the executive level, which informs operating decisions and strategic planning and resource allocation for the Company as a whole. Divisions (“business units”) within each operating group serve primarily as sales and marketing units to streamline sales efforts and enhance each operating group’s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific geographies or product lines. However, each business unit relies heavily on support services from the operating groups, as well as centralized support at the corporate level. 
A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group is provided in Note 16 “Segment information” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Electronic Components

Competition & Markets
The electronic components industry continues to be extremely competitive. The Company’s major competitors include: Arrow Electronics, Inc., Future Electronics, World Peace Group, Mouser Electronics and Digi-Key Electronics. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on particular sectors or on narrower geographic locations, markets, or products. As a result of these factors, Avnet’s pricing and product availability must remain competitive.
A key competitive factor in the electronic component distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount and selection of inventory to meet customers’ demand and rapid delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the Company purchases a majority of its products pursuant to franchised distribution agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days’ notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which are tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs, such as point of use replenishment, testing, assembly, programming, supply chain management, and materials management.
A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company’s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet’s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different parties.
Seasonality
Historically, Avnet’s business has not been materially impacted by seasonality, with the exception of an impact on consolidated results from shifts in geographic sales trends from Asia in the first half of a fiscal year to the Americas and EMEA regions in the second half of a fiscal year, which impact gross profit and operating income margins as a result of such seasonal geographic sales mix changes.

As of July 2, 2022, the Company’s global workforce totaled approximately 15,300 employees across 48 countries. Broken down by geographic region, approximately 4,500 employees are in the Americas, 6,600 employees in EMEA, and 4,200 employees in the Asia as of July 2, 2022.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
The Company’s DEI Vision is to have (i) an employee population that reflects the diverse communities in which they live, work, and do business, and (ii) an organizational culture which seeks out varying perspectives that allow the best ideas to come to light and help the Company achieve and maximize business success. The Company recognizes that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, cultural background, or religious beliefs. The Company’s commitment to diversity is evidenced by the makeup of its Board of Directors and its employees. As of July 2, 2022, the Board was 45% racially and ethnically diverse, and 27% women, and its global employees were over 45% women.
To oversee inclusion efforts, the Company created the Global DEI Council, which is made up of 20 individuals who represent various business units and corporate functions. The council meets regularly and engages with colleagues across the Company to connect DEI initiatives to the Company’s broader business strategy. In addition, for fiscal 2022 and 2021, executive’s annual incentive compensation included an ESG non-financial performance goal to demonstrate the Company’s ESG commitment.
In furtherance of DEI goals, the Company conducts listen-and-learn sessions on a variety of DEI topics, which promote meaningful discussions and allow employees to better understand and support each other. These group conversations are open to the entire Company, and are regularly attended by senior leaders, including the CEO. During fiscal 2022, five sessions were conducted covering Black History Month, Allyship and Gender Partnership in the Workplace, Autism, Women and Bias, and Gender Inclusivity. The Company also supports employee-led Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that are open to all employees and provide a forum to communicate and exchange ideas, build a network of relationships across the Company, and support each other in personal and career development. There are two ERGs for Black and women employees, and a third ERG for Hispanic and Latino employees is being formed. Additionally, the Company maintains an official culture and diversity calendar and publishes articles on its intranet to celebrate events and holidays around the world. In fiscal 2022, the Company’s employees celebrated International Women’s Day by holding a global event with external speakers discussing gender bias. Since 2020, Juneteenth, which

commemorates the official end of slavery in the United States and the emancipation of Black slaves, has been an official company-paid holiday for employees in the United States, a year before the federal government recognized it officially.
The Company provided unconscious bias training to its top 500 leaders, and is developing a suitable training for all employees. DEI education topics are regularly presented at the company-wide quarterly town hall, team and leadership meetings, and through internal webinars and podcasts open to all employees. 
The Company employs diversity initiatives to ensure women and minorities are considered for its internship program and leadership roles, and attempts to utilize inclusive recruitment practices to attract and source diverse talent and mitigate potential bias. It has formed partnerships with ABILITYJobs, an employment website for people with disabilities, and Diversity Jobs, a recruiting and employment website with a network of niche sites for Black, Latinx, Asians, Native Americans, women, veterans, people with disabilities, people over age fifty, and LGBTQIA+ community. The Company has built new relationships with college career services departments and diversity-based student organizations such as YearUp, and attends multiple diversity, veteran, disability, and college job fairs. 
The Company further undertakes DEI initiatives to improve its supplier and vendor diversity and support businesses with a Minority, Women or Veteran Business Enterprise (MWVBE) designation. For example, it provides opportunities regarding underwriting and other active roles in the Company’s capital-raising activities and short-term investments. In the area of procurement, the Company is exploring the possibility of dual sourcing as a strategy to give entry to MWVBE suppliers and vendors. For fiscal 2022, the Company began capturing its procurement diversity spend in the United States.
The Company continues to support women in the electronics industry, and has been a member of the Arizona Technology and Diversity Council since 2021. In addition, the Company’s CEO and another Company leader serve on the advisory board of Women in Electronics. It has participated in McKinsey’s “Women in the Workplace” study for the last six years, and has conducted for the past two years an industry-wide Women in Engineering Survey with results published annually on Farnell’s website.

Further, the Company’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offers all employees free professional and confidential counseling for personal and work-related issues, life coaching, and mindfulness coaching, and runs webinars on a variety of mental health and well-being topics.
The Company also looks for creative benefits that provide needed support to employees. For example, in the United States, the Company covers six months rental of a SNOO Smart Sleeper Bassinet to new parents to help them rest and keep babies safe. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company added a short-term employee loan program to assist employees during the difficult time. Further, as employees return to work, the Company expanded its flexible, hybrid work model to allow employees in certain functions or roles to work remotely during part of the week.
