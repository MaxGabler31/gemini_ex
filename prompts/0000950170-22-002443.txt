ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 Overview and Strategy
 Helios Technologies, Inc. (“Helios,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, is a global leader in highly engineered motion control and electronic controls technology for diverse end markets, including construction, material handling, agriculture, energy, recreational vehicles, marine, health and wellness.
We operate under two business segments: Hydraulics and Electronics. The Hydraulics segment designs and manufactures hydraulic cartridge valves, hydraulic quick release couplings as well as engineers complete hydraulic systems. The Electronics segment designs and manufactures customized electronic controls systems and displays for a variety of end markets including industrial and mobile, recreational and health and wellness.
In November 2016, we set out a vision to achieve $1 billion in sales in 2025 through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions and to deliver operating margins in excess of 20%. In 2021, we augmented our strategy and accelerated our growth plans to achieve the milestone of over $1 billion in sales with top tier adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25% in 2023.
We made significant progress in 2021 with our strategy to include evolving how we operate from a holding company structure toward an integrated operating company that better leverages sales, marketing, innovation, customer relationships and operational excellence across all our businesses. We also introduced the Helios Business System, “HBS” (pictured below), which is at the heart of all we do.



Our trusted global brands deliver technology solutions that ensure safety, reliability, connectivity and controls. The outer ring of the HBS is our mission - the four key mission pillars that we believe will deliver growth, diversification and market leading financial performance as we develop into a more sophisticated, globally-oriented, customer-centric and learning-based organization. These are:
1.Protect the business through customer centricity, and drive cash generation through the launch of new products and leveraging existing products;
 2.Think and act globally to better leverage our assets, accelerate innovation and diversify end markets by driving intra- and inter-company initiatives and by building in the region for the region; 
 3.Diversify our markets and sources of revenue to create greater opportunities for growth while reducing risk and cyclicality, which will enable us to swarm commercial opportunities that leverage the value of our products and technologies in new markets such as defense and commercial food service; and
 4.Develop our talent, our most critical resource, through a culture of customer centricity through the embracement of diversity, engagement of the team, focus on shared, deeply rooted values and promotion of a learning organization. 
 Underpinning our expectation of compounded annual growth of approximately two times our market's growth rates, we have an active pipeline and a history of acquiring companies with niche technologies, as well as strong profitability. Through our acquisition plans, we expect to include bolt-on flywheel type acquisitions (up to $100 million in enterprise value) and the evaluation of more transformative type acquisitions (enterprise value in excess of $100 million). The objective of our acquisition strategy is to enhance Helios by:
 •Growing our current product portfolio or adding new technologies and capabilities that complement our current offerings;
 •Expanding geographic presence; 
 •Bringing new customers or markets;
 •Meeting growth and profitability goals; and
 •Leveraging operational synergies and earnings accretion.
 To support the execution of our strategy, our financial strategy is oriented around delivering industry leading margins, a strong balance sheet and sufficient financial flexibility to support organic and acquisitive growth while supporting our dividend.
 We align our internal key performance indicators with our strategy to ensure our short-term actions will deliver long-term expectations.
 Our culture of innovation is at the core of our business. We have approximately 230 engineers in support of product innovation, as well as technical support and customer service. We believe our product innovation will aid organic growth and fill the expected demand resulting from the identified megatrends. All growth initiatives are intended to preserve Helios’ history of superior profitability and financial strength.
 Acquisitions
 We continue to build the Helios organization through acquisitions and were very active in 2021 following the acquisition on November 6, 2020, of BWG Holding I Corp. (known as “Balboa Water Group” or “Balboa”). Balboa is an innovative market leader of electronic controls for the health and wellness industry with proprietary and patented technology that enables end-to-end electronic control systems for therapy baths and spas. Headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, Balboa’s manufacturing operations are located in Mexico, with additional sales and warehouse operations in Denmark. The Balboa acquisition expanded Helios’ electronic control technology with complementary AC (alternating current) capabilities and enabled further diversification of end markets.



Our 2021 acquisitions included the following:
 •In January 2021, we acquired all of the assets of BJN Technologies, LLC, an innovative engineering solutions provider that was founded in 2014. With the acquisition, we formed the Helios Center of Engineering Excellence, LLC (“Engineering Center” or “Helios Engineering”) to centralize our innovation and technology advancements to better leverage existing talents across the electronics segment initially, and then throughout all of Helios. 
 •In July 2021, we completed another flywheel acquisition with NEM S.r.l. (“NEM”), an innovative hydraulic solutions company providing customized material handling, construction, industrial vehicle and agricultural applications to its global customer base, predominantly in Europe and Asia. NEM is ideally located in northern Italy’s Emilia Romagna region, one of the world’s most innovative and technology-friendly areas in the hydraulics industry. NEM enhances the Helios electro-hydraulic product offering, provides geographic expansion and adds scale to address new markets. Importantly, the added technology and applications expertise enables us to grow our original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") business throughout the world by leveraging NEM’s strong brand name in the Cartridge Valve Technology ("CVT") OEM markets in Europe. 
 •In October 2021, we completed the acquisition of assets related to the electronic control systems and parts business of Shenzhen Joyonway Electronics & Technology Co., Ltd and its related entities (collectively “Joyonway”). Joyonway is a fast-growing developer of control panels, software, systems and accessories for the health and wellness industry. Joyonway operates from two locations in China, Shenzhen and Dongguan, both of which are in the hub of electronics and software development in China. Joyonway complements the electronic controls platform from our Balboa Water Group acquisition by bringing an innovative portfolio of new solutions, strengthening our supply chain through broader geographic reach, increasing our manufacturing capacity to meet growing global demand, as well as better servicing ‘in the region for the region’.
Business Segments
 Our Hydraulics segment includes products sold under the Sun Hydraulics, Faster, Custom Fluidpower and NEM brands. The Electronics segment includes products sold under the Enovation Controls, Murphy, Balboa Water Group and Joyonway brands. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
Hydraulics
 There are three key technologies within our Hydraulics segment: cartridge valve technology, quick-release hydraulic couplings solutions (“QRC”) and hydraulic system design (“Systems”). Our CVT products provide functions important to a hydraulic system: to control rates and direction of fluid flow and to regulate and control pressures. We pioneered a fundamentally different design platform employing a floating construction that results in a self-alignment characteristic. This design provides better performance and reliability advantages compared with most competitors’ product offerings. Our cartridge valves are offered in five size ranges and include both electrically actuated and hydro-mechanical products. They are designed to be able to operate reliably at higher pressures, making them equally suitable for both industrial and mobile applications.
Hydraulic systems are increasingly taking signals from on-board electronic control systems, making it necessary for hydraulic products to be capable of digital communication. In response to this we have aggressively expanded our CVT offering of electrically actuated cartridge valves. We regularly expand our electro-hydraulic product offering for both the mobile and industrial hydraulics markets and gained significant advancements with the addition of NEM.


QRC products allow users to connect and disconnect quickly from any hydraulic circuit without leakage and ensure high-performance under high temperature and pressure using one or multiple couplers. Quick connection of multiple hydraulic lines can be accomplished through the use of a MultiFaster® or casting solution. Simultaneous connection of several lines is an important feature in many applications and allows for dramatic reduction of connection time, even when the system is under pressure. We design, engineer and distribute hydraulic coupling solutions primarily in the agriculture, construction equipment and industrial markets. In 2021, our QRC subsidiary, Faster S.r.l, was selected as a recipient of the John Deere Supplier Innovation Award for 2020 for its multi-connection couplings with integrated valve system. The award was presented to a select group of Suppliers who demonstrated innovation in a product or service they provide to John Deere. Award selections are based on four factors: creativity, feasibility, collaboration and bottom-line impact. In synergy with our Sun Hydraulics LLC business, our engineering teams have combined the advantages and features of MultiFaster® and Sun electro-hydraulic cartridge valves into an integrated manifold, reducing complexity and increasing reliability of the hydraulic circuit as a result.
 Systems provides engineered solutions for machine users, manufacturers or designers to fulfill complete system design requirements including electro-hydraulic, remote control, electronic control and programmable logic controller systems, as well as automation of existing equipment. The systems we manufacture:
 •are highly efficient;
 •increase and optimize productivity;
 •introduce safer operating procedures;
 •are smaller in size than competitive products;
 •allow for ease of maintenance; and 
 •reduce energy costs.
 Electronics
 We are an international leader in custom-tailored solutions for many industrial and commercial applications, including engines, engine-driven equipment and specialty vehicles with a broad range of rugged and reliable instruments such as displays, controls and instrumentation products through our Enovation Controls, Zero Off, Murphy and HCT brands. With the Balboa and Joyonway brands, we are also an industry leader in the health and wellness market providing globally comprehensive, electronic control systems with proprietary and patented technology for therapy bath and traditional and swim spas from a single source.
 As an innovative manufacturer of electronic controls and displays, we serve a variety of markets including off-highway, recreational and commercial marine, power sports and specialty vehicles, agriculture and water pumping, power generation, engine-driven industrial equipment and health and wellness. We partner directly with OEMs and support a worldwide network of authorized distributors and systems integrators. We make significant investments to garner an intense understanding of unique applications to solve complex system challenges.
Our focus is on creating customized systems that solve complex problems for niche mid-market volume customers. This allows us to target customers or industries that see value in this level of integration, and as a result, our customer list contains a wide variety of OEM applications. Product categories include traditional mechanical and electronic gauge instrumentation, plug and go CAN-based instruments, robust environmentally sealed controllers, hydraulic controllers, pumps and water flow systems, engineered panels, process monitoring instrumentation, printed circuit board assembly and wiring harness design. Our technologies can be used in both mobile or DC power applications, as well as fixed or AC power applications.


We offer our customers the ability to customize software on their products from the graphics for our PowerView® line of LCD displays. Our displays offer easy-to-read, bonded LCD graphical interfaces with the industry's best viewability even in direct sunlight or harsh weather conditions. Our controllers are built with the ability to withstand a wide ambient temperature range. User friendly software configuration tools allow engineers and non-engineers alike to create customized systems that solve complex problems on their equipment making the user experience more seamless.
Our panel solutions offer customized design and simple, turnkey solutions and our Industrial Panel Division offers engineers dedicated to applications, wire harnesses, panels and software development. Engineers focus entirely on custom and standard solutions built to desired specifications. Our services for design and development include on-site installation and testing with reviews to ensure the solution works with the application out of the box.
Globally, electronics products are sold primarily direct to OEM customers, with about 17% sold through independent, authorized channel partners in 2021. We continue to implement a strategic initiative to further diversify our channels to market, our geographic reach and end markets served. In addition to acquisitions such as Balboa and Joyonway, this effort includes the development of distribution partners globally. These efforts assist in our ability to diversify our global customer base, allowing us to grow more quickly, diversify the end-markets we serve and expand our customer base.
 Engineering
 In early 2021, we established the Helios Center of Engineering Excellence ("HCEE") to serve both our segments. Helios Engineering will play an important role in protecting the business, market diversification, globalization of product and developing talent. Importantly, Helios Engineering will advance ongoing joint product development efforts to address the megatrend of the electrification of machines.
Engineering teams work cross-functionally between the segments where engineers in the Electronics segment bring expertise to enable electrification of products and systems within the Hydraulics segment. While the core value of our products has been critical to our companies’ historical success and will remain important in the future, we see significant opportunities in bringing together the technology of hydraulics and electronics to create new products to better serve future market trends.
Manufacturing
 Strategy
 As part of our pivot to an integrated operating company, we are developing shared operations strategies across the companies in our Electronics and Hydraulics segments to leverage the breadth of this global footprint and depth of our manufacturing capabilities. In support of our mission to “Think and Act Globally”, we are actively driving “in the region, for the region” manufacturing. These initiatives are better aligning supply chain and manufacturing value streams with customers geographically to shorten lead times, reduce inventory, optimize cost and mitigate the risks of global supply. Established manufacturing centers provide scale in North America, and centers in both Asia and Europe are expanding to meet growing global demand. Manufacturing locations in the US, Italy, Mexico, UK, China and India provide a range of manufacturing options.
Hydraulics
 Our Hydraulics operations footprint leverages manufacturing centers in North America, Europe and Asia. Established supplier relationships and manufacturing capabilities in precision machining, finishing, heat treatment, process automation and test allow us to deliver best in class quality and market leading hydraulic control solutions.
We are continually driving improvements in operational performance. Projects leverage Lean Six Sigma best practices and automation to continually improve the safety, quality and productivity of our operating processes. Factory and supplier management is grounded in a people first approach that leverages the talents of our diverse global operations team. All global sites (across segments) operate to high standards of environmental stewardship and social responsibility and are advancing projects to reduce the global impact of our operating activities.
Electronics
 We offer a wide range of advanced electronics manufacturing capabilities that deliver integrated electronic control solutions to our diverse end markets. Manufacturing value streams incorporate high speed surface mount technology ("SMT") production lines with 3D solder paste inspection, 3D automated optical inspection and x-ray inspection to ensure quality and process control. Multipoint functional testing is conducted to ensure quality control of assembled products. Products are serialized and test data is captured against serial numbers and stored in a manufacturing execution system (“MES”) database for product traceability.
 Our culture of continuous improvement and people first approach spans both segments. Structured programs ensure our supply chains comply with Conflict Minerals standards, and we are moving our electronics manufacturing to lead free processes to further drive social responsibility and environmental stewardship.
 Sales and Marketing
 In 2021, no single customer made up more than 5% of consolidated net sales across the company.
Strategy
 One of the key drivers of future growth for both the Electronics and Hydraulics segments is our system sale approach to specific key OEM’s who utilize both electronics and hydraulics. While always protecting our existing business, we will approach strategic partners with the ability to have Helios provide a “system solution” comprising of components from our four primary world class brands to simplify supply chains and make doing business with Helios easier.
 Our four primary brands are comprised of over 125 direct sales and application specialist serving our customers' needs. We will continue to use this long successful approach while augmenting system sales with our key growth targets.
 We have started to promote the Helios brand while remaining focused on our well-established business unit brands. Trade show booths in the future will be shared space under a common Helios brand featuring “system solutions,” without losing the identity of Enovation Controls, Sun Hydraulics, Faster and Balboa Water Group.
Hydraulics
 In 2021, 59% of Helios’s sales were derived from the Hydraulics segment. Our 2021 Hydraulics segment sales were distributed fairly evenly among our three major geographic regions with 32% to the Americas, 35% to Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and 33% to Asia Pacific ("APAC").
We market and sell hydraulic products through value-add distributors and directly to OEMs. Our global channel partner network includes representation in many industrialized markets, and approximately 57% of segment sales are attributed to our channel partners who generally combine our products with other hydraulic components to design a complete hydraulic system. Sales direct to OEMs for integration in their machines make up the remaining 43%. We rely heavily on our distribution network in the U.S. with 77% of segment sales in this region going through channel partners. In EMEA and APAC, sales are split more evenly between OEMs and distributors. Technical support is provided by local sales and application experts based at each of our global operations.
 We provide end users with technical information through the websites of our operating companies and catalogs in multiple languages, including all information necessary to specify and obtain our products. We believe this approach helps stimulate demand for our products.
Electronics
 Electronic products are sold globally to OEM customers, distributors and system integrators. OEM sales constituted 83% of total Electronics segment sales in 2021. Building strong, lasting partnerships with OEMs is a priority. We rely on direct customer contacts to stimulate demand for our products. We work closely with our OEM customers to design and deliver innovative reliable products for specific applications. Our hardware and software products are designed and modified with the customer utilizing our extensive application knowledge to create unique system level products that cannot be easily replaced by simply switching out components. Twenty-four-hour customer service support and an in-house technical service department is available before, during and after the initial sale to create sustainable partnerships with our customers. Current OEM customers continue to specify our products in new projects based on the high level of engagement, quality products and delivery performance.
 Our OEM sales team collaborates with large OEMs, whereas the Distributor sales team works with an expanding number of distributors of varying sizes. Over the last few years, we restructured our sales teams to create a heavier dedicated focus on distributor sales for that team. Overall, approximately 17% of 2021 segment sales were derived from independent, authorized distributor channel partners.
 Geographically, our 2021 Electronics segment sales represented 73% to the Americas, 12% to EMEA and 15% to APAC. There is a well-defined initiative to grow sales in EMEA and APAC as part of our growth strategy. Additionally, synergies identified at the time of acquisition utilize customer relationships from the Hydraulics segment to create pull through of electronic products, and joint product development has created additional sales opportunities for both segments.
Competition
 Hydraulics
 Competitors in the hydraulics market are broken down into three categories: full-line hydraulics system producers, component-only producers of CVT or QRC products and low-cost producers. Most competitors market globally. Full-line producers, such as Parker Hannifin and Danfoss, can provide complete hydraulic systems to their customers, including components functionally like those manufactured in our Hydraulics segment. Similar to Helios, component-only producers are entities that offer only CVT or QRC products, while additional parts of the hydraulics system are obtained from other manufacturers. These include HydraForce, Inc., Delta Power Company, Stucchi, SpA. and CEJN. Low-cost producers, such as Winner and Valvole Italia, are competitors who have emerged in low-cost production areas such as APAC and Europe. These competitors will typically attempt to copy our products and like products designed by competitors. Low-cost producers generally have a limited product range compared with full line or cartridge valve and quick release coupling only producers, which restricts their ability to be competitive.
We believe that we compete based upon the quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics of our products and services.
 Electronics
 Competition within the electronics market is very broad with competitors ranging from large multinational companies with full electronics offerings, such as Continental and Garmin, to small niche companies that specialize in one product type. Enovation Controls is a niche player in the displays, controllers, gauges and instrumentation panel markets. Balboa is a niche player providing single source control and water flow systems in the health and wellness industry.
The market for products designed and manufactured by Enovation Controls is relatively fragmented with the top four to six companies comprising the majority of the market, mostly servicing the automotive space. Enovation Controls differentiates itself through product quality, customization ability and service with a focus on mid-market niche markets that are not well served by the large competitors. Our engagement and speed to market set us apart from larger competitors.


Balboa Water Group, including Joyonway, is the largest supplier of integrated end-to-end solutions for the therapy and wellness spa and bath market and is the only supplier capable of providing the full spectrum of components, from controls and displays to pumps and jets. By providing integrated architecture of hardware and software that is customized to match specific OEM products, Balboa creates a value proposition making it difficult to easily switch suppliers.
 Our overall position in our key markets is defensible due to high barriers to switching suppliers, such as up-front engineering and programming costs and positive perceptions among core customers on key selection criteria, including quality and service.
Human Capital
 We believe our employees are fundamental to our success. We are focused on attracting and retaining strong talent and furthering the development of our workforce through programs that not only enhance technical abilities but also strengthen leadership, communication and collaboration skills that contribute to our high performing, team-oriented culture. Helios is committed to attracting and developing a diverse workforce. Our shared values of accountability, integrity, inclusion, innovation and leadership foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for our colleagues and their ideas.
 At the end of our 2021 fiscal year we employed over 2,350 colleagues worldwide. Approximately 49% of our employees are located in the Americas region, 29% in the EMEA region and 22% in APAC. In addition, we have a committed service agreement with a third party that supports nearly 1,150 jobs in Mexico and serves as an integral part of our supply chain. We also hire consultants, independent contractors and temporary workers as needed to augment our workforce.
Employees are guided by our Shared Values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Company and its employees believe that respecting others means recognizing the dignity of every person and embracing diversity around the globe. Helios is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment and encourages diversity in its hiring and employment practices. Our leadership and employees strive to “do the right thing by living with integrity,” which includes caring for communities around the world and the people they employ.
 Through leader collaboration, we guide our people strategy through employee advocacy that grows talent, amplifies the employee experience and leverages technology to attract, retain and develop the workforce of the future. In 2021, we developed and launched a Career Development Program, which targets recent graduates, providing them with bona fide job rotations aimed at building future leaders throughout critical business disciplines. We renewed our Leadership Development programs and continue to provide structured stretch assignments/projects as we continuously improve in our core value of “Develop Talent.”
The Company is committed to the safety of its employees. Each company within our group maintains environmental, health and safety policies that seek to promote the operation of our business in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of the public and our employees. Several of our businesses have onsite medical clinics for employees and their families. Our companies offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and preventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides professional counseling to employees and their family members.
 We have approximately 490 employees in Italy who are represented by a union. We have constructive and productive dialog on a regular basis with union leaders. To the best of our knowledge, there is no labor dispute, strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending or threatened against or affecting the Company, nor is there any basis for any of the foregoing.
Patents and Trademarks
 In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how and other intellectual property rights, we own approximately 305 active patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products and businesses. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent upon the quality and functional performance of our products and our relationship with the marketplace, rather than on any single patent, trademark, copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights. However, our patents are important in the defense of our intellectual property from competitors who exploit product development that is not otherwise legally protected by its creator.
Governmental Regulations
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including in foreign jurisdictions, relating to our business practices, labor and employment, construction, land use and taxation, among others. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our company, which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.
 Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the UK Anti-Bribery Act of 2010. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability, and cause a loss of reputation in the market. Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly.
 Export Controls and Trade Policies
 We are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, we are subject to trade and import and export regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC). Our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices, including trade restrictions, tariffs and sanctions.
Environmental Regulations
 Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.
Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 The Company's operations are subject to extensive and stringent governmental regulations including regulations related to the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and similar safety and health regulations promulgated in other countries. The Company's employees in its manufacturing facilities operate complicated machinery that may cause substantial injury or death upon malfunction or improper operation. The Company's manufacturing locations are subject to the workplace safety rules and regulations of OSHA and local safety and health laws. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the requirements of these laws. However, in the event that the Company is unable to comply with OSHA or other environmental requirements, the Company could be subject to substantial sanctions, including restrictions on its business operations, monetary liability and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business.
Sustainability
 Corporate responsibility and sustainability are reflected in the Company’s business strategy. The board of directors recently reviewed the Company’s historical commitment to principles of corporate and social responsibility. The Company is committed to reducing emissions, recycling and minimizing its environmental footprint and has implemented several strategies to achieve these goals. The Company is also fully committed to the safety of its employees and the safety of those who use its products. Additionally, the Company actively seeks to support diversity initiatives in its hiring and employment practices. The Board and its committees will continue to assist the Company in its oversight of corporate social responsibilities, significant public policy issues, health and safety and climate-change related trends.
