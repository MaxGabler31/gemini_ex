Marketing
The Company’s marketing strategy is to develop brand-specific plans and related promotional materials that foster a consistent message for each of the Company’s brands across the globe. Marketing campaigns and strategies vary by brand and are generally designed to target consumers in order to increase awareness of, and affinity for, the Company’s brands. The Company’s marketing typically emphasizes compelling brand stories and brand recognition associated with new and existing products, the performance, comfort and quality features and styles of our products within each of the Company’s brands, as well as raising global brand relevance and awareness. The Company’s brand marketing has an omni-channel approach and 
includes various means of delivery, such as print and radio advertising, search engine optimization, social networking sites, event sponsorships, in-store point-of-purchase displays, promotional materials and sales and technical assistance.
The Company operates branded eCommerce sites that the Company believes are effective marketing tools to consumers. The Company maintains an active presence on a variety of global social media platforms, and the Company’s digital marketing seeks to create demand among new consumers as well as connecting consumers to brand content and products. 
In addition to the Company’s internal marketing efforts, each brand provides its third-party licensees and distributors with creative direction, brand images and other materials to convey globally consistent brand messaging. The Company believes its brand names represent a competitive advantage, and the Company, its licensees and its distributors make significant marketing investments to promote and enhance the market positions of its products and drive brand awareness.
Domestic Sales and Distribution
The Company uses a variety of means to support sales to a variety of domestic distribution channels:
•The Company uses a dedicated sales force and customer service team, third party sales representatives and point-of-purchase materials to support domestic sales. 
•The Company maintains core in-stock inventories to service department stores, national chains, specialty retailers, catalog retailers, independent retailers, uniform outlets and its own consumer-direct business.
•The Company uses volume direct programs to ship products to retail customers and to provide products at competitive prices to service major retail, catalog, mass merchant and government customers.
•The Company also operates brick and mortar retail stores and eCommerce sites. 
International Operations and Global Licensing
The Company’s foreign-sourced revenue is generated from a combination of (i) sales of branded footwear and apparel through the Company’s owned operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in continental Europe and Asia-Pacific; (ii) revenue from third-party distributors for certain markets and businesses; (iii) revenue from a network of third-party licensees; and (iv) revenue and income from joint ventures that market the Company’s branded products in Mexico, Colombia and China. The Company’s international owned operations are located in markets where the Company believes it can gain a strategic advantage by directly controlling the sale of its products into retail accounts. License and distribution arrangements enable the Company to generate sales in other markets without the capital commitment required to maintain related foreign operations, employees, inventories or localized marketing programs. The Company believes that joint ventures provide it with a more meaningful ownership stake and near-term brand impact in fast-growing markets than its traditional licensee and distributor arrangements.
The Company continues to develop its international network of third-party licensees and distributors to market its branded products. The Company assists its licensees in designing products that are appropriate to each foreign market, yet consistent with global brand positioning. Pursuant to license or distribution agreements, third-party licensees and distributors either purchase goods directly from the Company and authorized third-party manufacturers or manufacture branded products themselves, consistent with Company standards. Distributors and licensees are responsible for independently marketing and distributing the Company’s branded products in their respective territories, with product and marketing support from the Company.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
The Company directly controls the majority of the units of footwear and apparel sourced under the Company’s brand names. The Company’s licensees directly control the balance. Substantially all of the units sourced by the Company are procured from numerous third-party manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region. The Company maintains offices in the Asia Pacific region to develop and facilitate sourcing strategies. The Company has established guidelines for each of its third-party manufacturers in order to monitor product quality, labor practices and financial viability. The Company has adopted “Engagement Criteria for Partners and Sources,” a policy that requires the Company’s domestic and foreign manufacturers, licensees and distributors to use ethical business standards, comply with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations, commit to use environmentally safe practices, treat employees fairly with respect to wages, benefits and working conditions and not use child or prison labor. The Company’s third-party sourcing strategy allows the Company to (i) benefit from lower manufacturing costs and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities; (ii) source high quality raw materials from around the world; and (iii) avoid capital expenditures necessary for additional owned factories. The Company believes that its overall global manufacturing strategy provides the flexibility to properly balance the need for timely shipments, high quality products and competitive pricing.
The Company’s principal raw material is quality leather, which it purchases from a select group of domestic and foreign suppliers. The widespread availability of common upper materials and specialty leathers eliminates reliance by the Company on a single supplier.
The Company has a diversified supply base of raw pigskins and currently purchases a majority of the raw pigskins used for its Wolverine Leathers Division from one domestic source, which has been a reliable and consistent supplier to the Company for over 50 years. The Company purchases all of its other raw materials and component parts from a variety of sources and does not believe that any of these sources are a dominant supplier.
Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
The Company holds a significant portfolio of registered and common law trademarks that identify its branded products and technologies. The Company’s owned trademarks include Hush Puppies®, Dog Likeness (registered design trademark), Wolverine®, Bates®, Chaco®, Soft Style®, Wolverine Fusion®, DuraShocks®, MultiShox®, Wolverine Compressor®, Wolverine ICS®, Hidden Tracks®, iTechnology™, Bounce®, Comfort Curve®, Hytest®, Merrell®, M Circle Design (registered design trademark), Continuum®, Q Form®, Sperry®, Saucony®, Stride Rite®, Sweaty Betty® and Keds®. The Company’s Wolverine Leathers Division markets its pigskin leathers under the trademarks Wolverine Warrior Leather®, Weather Tight® and All Season Weather Leathers™. The Company has footwear marketing and distribution rights under the Cat® and Harley-Davidson® trademarks pursuant to license arrangements with the respective trademark owners. The Cat® license was recently renewed and the license term runs through December 31, 2028 and the Harley-Davidson® license term runs through December 31, 2022. Both licenses are subject to early termination for breach.
The Company believes that consumers identify its products by the Company’s trademarks and that its trademarks are valuable assets. The Company has a policy of registering its primary trademarks and vigorously defending its trademarks against infringement or other threats whenever practicable. The Company also holds many design and utility patents, copyrights and various other proprietary rights. The Company protects its proprietary rights under applicable laws.
Seasonality
The Company experiences moderate fluctuations in sales volume during the year, as reflected in quarterly revenue. The Company expects current seasonal sales patterns to continue in future years. The Company also experiences some fluctuation in its levels of working capital, typically including an increase in net working capital requirements near the end of the first and third fiscal quarters. The Company meets its working capital requirements through internal operating cash flows and, as needed, the Revolving Facility, as discussed in more detail under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7: "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". The Company's working capital could also be impacted by other events, including pandemics such as COVID-19.
Competition
The Company markets its footwear and apparel lines in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. The Company competes with numerous domestic and international footwear and apparel designers and marketers, some of whom are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Product performance and quality, including technological improvements, product identity, competitive pricing, ability to control costs and ability to adapt to style changes are all important elements of competition in the footwear and apparel markets served by the Company. The footwear and apparel industries are subject to changes in consumer preferences. The Company strives to maintain its competitive position through promotions designed to increase brand awareness, manufacturing and sourcing efficiencies, and the style, comfort and value of its products. Future sales by the Company will be affected by its continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to meet shifts in consumer preferences.
Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, the Company is unable to state with certainty its competitive position in the overall footwear and apparel industries. The non-athletic footwear and apparel markets are highly fragmented and no one company has a dominant market position.
Environmental Matters
The Company uses and generates certain substances and wastes that are regulated or may be deemed hazardous to the environment under certain federal, state and local regulations. The Company works with foreign and domestic federal, state and local agencies from time to time to resolve cleanup issues at various affected sites and other regulatory issues. Financial information regarding the Company’s environmental remediation activities is found in Note 17 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company believes that leaders should be developed at every stage of their career, from new managers to executives. We have a global leadership development program for all people leaders through partnerships with top educational institutions which focuses both on business leadership and capabilities needed to evolve the Company's businesses, and on people leadership capabilities to build, retain, and inspire top performing teams. As we continue to evolve and transform, the continued development of leaders is viewed as critical to the Company's future success. To enhance the development of employees, the Company offers a wide variety of virtual learning courses, instructor led classes, video libraries, and quick reference documents and provides tuition reimbursement to help employees achieve higher education goals.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: The Company is committed to having a diverse and inclusive workforce which is reflected in the wide range of cultures, religions, ethnicities and nationalities, as well as varied professional and educational backgrounds currently represented at the Company. Because the Company believes in cultivating a well-rounded, diverse workforce, the Company continuously seeks out individuals who reflect and support the goal of maintaining a diverse corporation. We have further prioritized diversity and inclusion by hiring an expert partner to help us build a framework to promote an inclusive environment today and into the future in order to make the Company an even greater place to work. The Company's major development focus over the next year will be in implementing a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion learning program which includes learning on inclusive teams, inclusive leadership, and inclusive selection.
Health and Safety: The health and safety of the Company's employees is one of its highest priorities. The Company has developed safety protocols to enhance the health and safety of all employees. The Environmental, Health, & Safety Council is composed of representatives from across the Company and coordinates health and safety matters on a real time basis. The Company's focus on the health and safety of its workforce is also evidenced by the actions it has taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe, including:
•Increasing employees' work from home flexibility;

As a result, the majority of the Company's distribution facilities have continued operating since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In order to keep distribution facilities open, the Company invested in creating physically safe work environments for employees.
