Item 1. Business
 
We mine and market coal from reserves and operations located exclusively in the Illinois Basin. We control nearly 2.1 billion tons of proven and probable coal in the state of Illinois (including 322 million tons of coal reserves associated with our Hillsboro complex), which makes us one of the largest reserve holders in the United States. Our reserves consist principally of three large contiguous blocks of uniform, thick, high heat content (high Btu) thermal coal which is ideal for highly productive longwall operations. Thermal coal is used by power plants and industrial steam boilers to produce electricity or process steam.
 
We own four mining complexes where we currently operate three longwall mines and one continuous miner operation. We invested substantially to construct state-of-the-art, low-cost and highly productive mining operations and related transportation infrastructure. Our four mining complexes can collectively support up to nine longwalls, with a portion of the existing surface infrastructure available to be shared among most of our potential future longwalls. Mining operations at our Hillsboro complex were idled since March 2015 due to a combustion event.  In October 2018, we reached a settlement of certain litigation matters associated with the Hillsboro combustion event.  In January 2019, we resumed production at Hillsboro with one continuous miner unit.  We are currently evaluating our future operations at Hillsboro. See Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 27—Subsequent Events” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent developments at Hillsboro.
 
Our operations are strategically located near multiple rail and river transportation access points giving us cost-competitive transportation options. We have developed infrastructure that provides each of our four mining complexes with multiple transportation outlets including direct and indirect access to five Class I railroads. Our access to competing rail carriers as well as access to truck and barge transport provides us with operating flexibility and minimizes transportation costs. We own a 25 million ton per year barge-loading river terminal on the Ohio River and also have contractual agreements for nearly 15 million tons per year of export terminal capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. We have long-term, fixed price transportation contracts from our mines to these terminals. These logistical arrangements provide transportation cost certainty and the flexibility to direct shipments to markets that provide the highest margin for our coal sales. 
 
We market and sell our coal primarily to electric utility and industrial companies in the eastern half of the United States and the international market. We sell the majority of our domestic tonnages to electric utilities with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, are designed to eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide.

Longwall mining is a highly-automated, underground mining technique that generates high volumes of low-cost coal production and is typically supported by one or two continuous mining units. While the continuous mining units contribute to coal production, the primary function is to prepare an area of the mine for longwall operations. A longwall mining system uses a shearer to cut the coal, self-advancing roof supports to protect the miners working at the longwall face and an armored face conveyor to transport the coal. The longwall mining system is highly productive due to the continuous nature of coal production and the high volume of coal produced relative to the number of personnel required to operate the system. 
 
Below is an illustrative diagram of the longwall mining process:

We have been able to sustain our high productivity and low operating costs since we started our first longwall in 2008 and the high productivity at the newer mines we have developed demonstrates the repeatability of our mine design. The high productivity translates into low costs and, in 2018, our operations had an average cash cost of $22.85 per ton sold. Our mines that operated during 2018 were among the most productive underground coal mines in the United States on a clean tons produced per underground man hour basis based on MSHA data, as illustrated below. 


Source: MSHA data. Note: The chart above displays the top 25 most productive underground mines out of 160 mines with over 100,000 tons produced during 2018 on a clean tons produced per man hour basis. Darker shading denotes mines owned by Foresight Energy LP. Mining operations at our Hillsboro complex have been idled since March 2015 due to a combustion event.
Williamson Mining Complex 
 
Our Williamson mine is wholly-owned by our subsidiary Williamson Energy, LLC (“Williamson”) and is located in southern Illinois near the town of Marion. Williamson is the first mine we developed, with longwall mining production commencing in 2008. The mine operates in the Herrin No. 6 Seam, using one longwall system and two continuous miner units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. Coal is washed at Williamson’s 2,000 tons-per-hour (“tph”) preparation plant, stockpiled and then shipped by rail or truck to our customers or a terminal. Williamson’s coal is shipped via the CN and EVWR railroads to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to serve the domestic thermal market or to a terminal near New Orleans to serve the international thermal market. Williamson has access to several barge facilities on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and two vessel loading facilities near New Orleans. Williamson was the second most productive underground coal mine in the United States in 2018 on a clean tons produced per underground man hour basis based on MSHA data.
Sugar Camp Mining Complex 
 
Our Sugar Camp mine is wholly-owned by our subsidiary Sugar Camp Energy, LLC (“Sugar Camp”), and is located in southern Illinois approximately 12 miles north of Williamson. Sugar Camp’s first longwall system began production in the first quarter of 2012 and its second longwall system began production in the second quarter of 2014. Sugar Camp’s original infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt, material handling system and rail loadout, supports both longwalls. Sugar Camp operates in the Herrin No. 6 Seam and uses a similar mine design and equipment as Williamson. With additional equipment, infrastructure and mine development, Sugar Camp has the capacity to add two incremental longwall systems. Coal is washed at Sugar Camp’s two 2,000 tph preparation plants, stockpiled and then shipped by rail or truck to our customers or a terminal. Sugar Camp has direct access to the EVWR and CN railroads, which can deliver its coal to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, respectively, to serve the domestic thermal market or to two vessel loading facilities near New Orleans to serve the international thermal market. Sugar Camp also has indirect access to the NS, BNSF and CSX railroads. Sugar Camp was the third most productive underground coal mine in the United States in 2018 on a clean tons produced per underground man hour basis based on MSHA data.

Hillsboro Mining Complex 
 
Our Hillsboro mine is wholly-owned by our subsidiary Hillsboro Energy LLC (“Hillsboro”), and is located in central Illinois near the town of Hillsboro. Hillsboro’s longwall mining system began production in the third quarter of 2012. The mine operates in the Herrin No. 6 Seam and uses similar mine design and similar equipment as Williamson and Sugar Camp. Coal is washed at Hillsboro’s 2,000 tph preparation plant, stockpiled and then shipped by rail or truck to our customers or a terminal. Hillsboro has direct access to the UP and NS railroads and indirect access to the CN railroad, which allows for the delivery of its coal directly to customers or to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in order to serve the domestic thermal market or the international thermal market through two terminals near New Orleans. 
 
Our Hillsboro mine experienced an underground combustion event beginning in March 2015 and had been idle since that time.  In December 2017, we submitted a re-entry plan to MSHA which contained a plan for the permanent sealing of the current longwall district of the Hillsboro mine.  In connection with the re-entry plan, certain longwall equipment and other related assets was permanently sealed within and was not recovered, resulting in a $42.7 million impairment loss during 2017.  In connection with certain litigation matters related to the combustion event and due to additional facts and circumstances arising in April 2018, we announced that our Hillsboro operation would be closed and certain long-lived assets consisting primarily of mineral reserves and certain buildings and structures, machinery and equipment, and other related assets were not expected to generate future positive cash flows. As the expected future cash flows were projected to be immaterial and not sufficient to support the recoverability of the assets’ carrying values, the assets were reduced to their estimated fair values.  As such, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $110.7 million during 2018.  In October 2018, we reached a settlement of certain litigation matters associated with the Hillsboro combustion event. In January 2019, we resumed production at Hillsboro with one continuous miner unit.  We are currently evaluating our future operations at Hillsboro. See Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 27—Subsequent Events” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent developments at Hillsboro.
 
Macoupin Mining Complex 
 
Our Macoupin mine is wholly-owned by our subsidiary Macoupin Energy LLC (“Macoupin”), and is located in central Illinois near the town of Carlinville. We acquired the Macoupin mine in 2009 and sealed the majority of the previously mined area and implemented a new mine plan and design. In addition, the surface facilities were upgraded, including the rehabilitation of the preparation plant. Coal production began in 2009 with a single continuous miner super-section utilizing battery powered coal haulers. An additional continuous miner unit was added in 2011 using a flexible conveyor train system rather than coal haulers. Coal is washed at Macoupin’s 850 tph preparation plant, stockpiled and then shipped by rail or truck to our customers or a terminal. Macoupin has direct access to both the UP and NS railroads and indirect access to the CN railroad, which allows for the delivery of its coal directly to customers or to terminals at the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to serve the domestic thermal market or the international thermal market through two terminals near New Orleans. Macoupin was the eleventh most productive underground coal mine in the United States in 2018 on a clean tons produced per underground man hour basis based on MSHA data. 
Transportation 
 
Our coal is transported to our domestic and export customers by rail, barge, truck, and vessel. Depending on the proximity of our customers to the mines and the transportation available to deliver coal to that customer, transportation costs can be a substantial part of the total delivered cost of coal. Because our reserves and mines are favorably located near multiple rail and river transportation options, we believe we can negotiate advantageous transportation rates, allowing us to keep our transportation costs relatively low while providing broad market access for our coal. 
 
We have direct and indirect rail access to domestic customers via five Class I railroads, river access to domestic customers via various Ohio and Mississippi River terminals, and river and rail access to coal export terminals for shipping to international customers. We have agreements with rail carriers that vary in initial length from one to twenty years. We also have favorable access to the international market through the CN railroad and export terminals through long-term contractual arrangements. The international market provides us with an alternative to the domestic market and has historically been an important economic outlet for our coal. While transportation costs are higher for exports to the international market, we do, in certain market conditions, receive higher coal sale prices on export sales, which offset the higher transportation costs. Rates and practices of the transportation companies serving a particular mine or customer may affect our marketing efforts with respect to coal produced from the relevant mine. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 19% of our coal sales volume was shipped to our domestic customers by barge, 43% to our domestic customers by rail or truck and 38% was shipped to our international customers.

Our Sitran terminal is a high-capacity coal transloading facility on the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana to which each of our mines has access. The facility currently has a single rail loop, a bottom discharge rail car unloader, stacking tubes to facilitate ground storage and blending, barge loading capabilities and throughput capacity of 25 million tons of coal per year. The terminal has the potential for a dual rail loop that would have capacity for two loaded and two empty unit trains. 
 
Coal Marketing and Sales
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated total revenues of $1.105 billion, $954.5 million and $875.8 million, respectively. Our primary domestic customers are electric utility and industrial companies in the eastern half of the United States. Our three largest customers in 2018 were Javelin Global Commodities (an affiliate of Murray Energy), Southern Company, and Santee Cooper, representing approximately 42%, 18% and 8% of our total coal sales revenues, respectively. If these three customers or any of our largest customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to our largest customers on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current contracts, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 
The international thermal coal market has also been a substantial part of our business with direct and indirect sales to end users in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, export tons represented approximately 38%, 27% and 17% of tons sold, respectively. The charts below illustrate our sales mix, by destination, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.


Our management actively monitors trends in contract pricing and seeks to enter into coal sales contracts at favorable prices. Many of our contracts allow us to substitute coal from our other mining complexes. For 2019, as of February 21, 2019, we have 15.3 million tons of our projected production contractually committed. 
 
The terms of our coal supply agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of these contracts, including price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity adjustment mechanisms, permitted sources of supply, future regulatory changes, extension options, force majeure provisions, and termination and assignment provisions, vary significantly by customer. 
 
Most of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific quality characteristics such as heat content, sulfur, and ash. Failure to meet these conditions could result in substantial price reductions or suspension or termination of the contract at the election of the customer. Although the minimum volume to be delivered under a long-term contract is stipulated, either party may vary the timing of delivery based on certain contractual provisions. Contracts also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party, including labor disputes. Some contracts may terminate upon continuance of an event of force majeure for an extended period. Some of our long-term contracts provide for a predetermined adjustment to the stipulated base price at times specified in the agreement or at other periodic intervals to account for changes in prevailing market prices. 
 
In addition, most of our contracts contain provisions permitting us to adjust the base price due to compliance with new statutes, ordinances or regulations that affect our costs related to performance of the agreement. Also, some of our contracts contain provisions that allow for the recovery of certain costs incurred due to modifications or changes in the interpretations or application of any applicable government statutes. 
 
8
 

Price reopener provisions are present in certain of our long-term contracts. These provisions may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price. In a limited number of agreements, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract. 
 
Competition 
 
The United States coal industry is highly competitive, both regionally and nationally. In the Illinois Basin, we compete primarily with coal producers such as Peabody Energy Corporation, Alliance Resource Partners, L.P., Murray Energy (an affiliate), and Sunrise Coal LLC. Outside of the Illinois Basin, we compete broadly for coal sales with other United States-based producers of thermal coal, and we compete internationally with numerous global coal producers. 
 
A number of factors beyond our control affect the markets in which we sell our coal. Continued demand for our coal and the prices obtained by us depend primarily on: the coal consumption patterns of the electricity industry in the United States and elsewhere around the world; the availability, location, cost of transportation and price of competing coal; and other electricity generation and fuel supply sources such as natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy. Coal consumption patterns are affected primarily by the demand for electricity, the amount of coal supply in the market, environmental and other governmental regulations and technological developments. The most important factors on which we compete are price, coal quality characteristics, and reliability of supply. 
 
Segments
 
We operate as a single reportable segment. See Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our consolidated revenues and total assets.
 
Employees and Labor Relations 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 15 corporate employees and 824 employees working in mining and mining-related operations. None of our operations have employees represented by a union. In 2015, we entered into a management services agreement with a subsidiary of Murray Energy pursuant to which it provides certain management and administration services to us for a quarterly fee. Please read Part II. “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17–Related-Party Transactions” for additional discussion.

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to employee health and safety; water discharges; air emissions; plant and wildlife protection; the restoration of mining properties; the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes; remediation of contaminants; surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions. 
 
We are not aware of any notice from a governmental agency of any material non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, or permits that the Partnership has failed to address. However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future; that we will be able to always obtain, maintain or renew required permits; or that changes in these requirements or their enforcement or the discovery of new conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities in the future. Due to the nature of the regulatory programs that apply to our mining operations, which can impose liability even in the absence of fault and often involve subjective criteria, it is not reasonable to expect any coal mining operation to be free of citations. Certain of our current and historical mining operations use or have used or store regulated materials which, if released into the environment, may require investigation and remediation. Under certain permits, we are required to monitor groundwater quality on and adjacent to our sites and to develop and implement plans to minimize and correct land subsidence, as well as impacts on waterways and wetlands, caused by our mining operations. Major regulatory requirements are briefly discussed below. 
 
Mine Safety and Health 
 
In the United States, the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “1977 Act”) and the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (“MINER Act”) impose stringent mine safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. In 1978, MSHA was created to carry out the mandates of the 1977 Act and was granted enforcement authority. MSHA is authorized to inspect all underground mining operations at least four times a year and issue citations with civil penalties for the violation of a mandatory health and safety standard. MSHA review and approval is required for a number of miner safety and welfare plans including ventilation, roof control/bolting, safety training and ground control, refuse disposal and impoundments and respirable dust. Also, the State of Illinois has its own programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. 
 
Under the 1977 Act, MSHA has the authority to issue orders or citations to mine operators regardless of the degree of culpable conduct engaged in by the operator, and it must assess a penalty for each citation and most orders. Factors such as degree of negligence and gravity of the violation, among other things, affect the am ount of penalty assessed, and sometimes permit MSHA to issue orders directing withdrawal of miners from the mine or affected areas within the mine. The 1977 Act contains provisions that can impose criminal liability on the mine operator or individuals if the statutory prerequisite is satisfied. 
 
The MINER Act added more extensive health and safety compliance standards, and increased civil and criminal penalties. Some of the MINER Act requirements included stricter criteria for sealing off abandoned areas of mines, the addition of refuge alternatives, stricter requirements for conveyor belts, and upgrades to communication with and tracking of miners underground. 
 
MSHA continues to promulgate rules that affect our mining operations. In March 2013, MSHA implemented a revised Pattern of Violations (“POV”) standard. Under the revised standard, mine operators are no longer entitled to a ninety day notice of potential POV. In addition, MSHA began screening for POV by using issued citations and orders, prior to their final adjudication. If a mine is designated as having a POV, MSHA will issue an order withdrawing miners from any areas affected by violations which pose a significant and substantial (“S&S”) hazard to the health and/or safety of miners. Once a mine is in POV status, it can be removed from that status only upon (i) a complete inspection of the entire mine with no S&S enforcement actions issued by MSHA or (ii) no POV-related withdrawal orders being issued by MSHA within ninety (90) days following the mine operator being placed on POV status. However, from time to time one or more of our operations may meet the POV screening criteria, and we cannot make assurances that one or more of our operations will not be placed into POV status, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
In April 2014, MSHA issued, among other provisions, a final rule lowering certain standards for respirable dust. Specifically, the rule reduces the overall dust standard from 2.0 to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air and cuts in half the standard from 1.0 to 0.5 for certain mine entries and miners with pneumoconiosis, as well as changes sampling protocols and increases governmental oversight. On August 1, 2016, Phase III of MSHA’s respirable dust rule, imposing these new limits, went into effect. These final rules could make compliance more costly and approval for ventilation plans in underground coal mines more difficult to obtain. 
 
In August 2016 and then again in January 2017 and 2018, MSHA adjusted its existing civil penalties for inflation, which prior to these dates were last set in 2007. A final rule was published in the federal register on January 23, 2019.  While these rules resulted in 
 10
 

different relative impacts on particular penalty amounts, the net effect of these adjustments increased the amount of penalties that MSHA may impose on operators. 
 
In January 2015, MSHA issued a final rule on the use of proximity detection systems on certain pieces of underground mining equipment. The rule requires, among other provisions, continuous mining machines to be equipped with electronic sensing devices that can detect the presence of miners in proximity to the machines and then cause moving or repositioning continuous mining machines to stop before contacting a miner. The final rule has a phase in period, depending upon the age of the continuous mining machine, of 8 to 36 months. 
 
These requirements have, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our operating costs. 
 
In June 2016, MSHA issued a request for information on approaches to control and monitor miners’ exposures to diesel exhaust. While MSHA’s existing regulations address health hazards to coal miners from exposure to diesel particulate matter (“DPM”), MSHA is requesting information on approaches that would improve control of DPM and diesel exhaust. The request for information and comments has been extended and is currently set to expire in March 2019.  Although no rule has been proposed, if a rule that lowered DPM emission limits is proposed and adopted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 
 
At this time, it is not possible to predict the full effect that various new or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but certain will increase our costs and those of our competitors. Some, but not all, of these additional costs may be passed on to customers.
 
Black Lung 
 
Under the United States Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, each coal mine operator must secure payment of federal black lung benefits to claimants who have been diagnosed with pneumoconiosis and are current or former employees and must also pay into a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. Through December 31, 2018, the trust fund was funded by an excise tax on production sold domestically of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales prices, excluding transportation.  Effective January 1, 2019, these rates decreased to a maximum of $0.50 per ton for deep-mined coal and $0.25 per ton for surfaced-mined coal, with neither amount to exceed 2% of the gross sales price, excluding transportation. 
U.S. Environmental Laws 
 
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws. Some of these laws, as discussed below, impose stringent requirements on our coal mining operations. U.S. federal and state regulations require regular monitoring of our mines and other facilities to ensure compliance. U.S. federal and state inspectors are required to inspect our mining facilities on a frequent schedule. Future laws, regulations or orders, as well as future interpretations or more rigorous enforcement of existing laws, regulations or orders, may require increases in capital and operating costs, the extent of which we cannot predict. 
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”)
 
SMCRA, which is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”), establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of deep mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the OSM or the applicable state agency. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the regulatory authority. Illinois has achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization.  SMCRA also stipulates compliance with many other major environmental statutes, including: the Clean Air Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Clean Water Act of 1972 (“CWA”); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). SMCRA seeks to limit the adverse impacts of coal mining to the environment, and more restrictive requirements may be adopted from time to time.
 
SMCRA permit provisions include a complex set of requirements governing the following processes: coal prospecting; mine plan development; topsoil removal, storage and replacement; selective handling of overburden materials; mine pit backfilling and grading; protection of the hydrologic balance; subsidence control for underground mines; surface drainage control; mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment; restoration to the approximate original contour; and re-vegetation. The disposal of coal refuse is also permitted under SMCRA. Both coarse refuse and slurry disposal areas, including the disposal of slurry underground, require permits from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (“IDNR”).

The mining permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately characterize the pre-mine environmental condition of the permit area. This work includes surveys of culturally and historically important natural resources, soils, vegetation, and wildlife, as well as the assessment of surface and ground water hydrology, climatology and wetlands. In conducting this work, we collect geologic data to define and model the soil and rock structures and coal that we will mine. We develop mining and reclamation plans by utilizing this geologic data and incorporating elements of the environmental data. The mining and reclamation plan incorporates the provisions of SMCRA, state programs and other complementary environmental programs that regulate coal mining. Also included in the permit application are documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to coal, minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land, and documents required by the OSM’s Applicant Violator System, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors and principal owners of the entity. 
 
Once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness review and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given that also provides for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Some SMCRA mine permits take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine and may take months or years to be reviewed and issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public and other agencies have rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of reclamation obligations. 
 
The Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is part of SMCRA, requires a fee on all coal produced. The proceeds are used to reclaim mine lands closed or abandoned prior to SMCRA’s adoption in 1977. The fee is $0.28 per ton on surface-mined coal and $0.12 per ton on deep-mined coal from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2021. 
 
Various federal and state laws, including SMCRA, require us to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure and reclamation costs. In August 2016, the OSM issued a Policy Advisory discouraging state regulatory authorities from approving self-bonding arrangements. The Policy Advisory indicated that the OSM would begin more closely reviewing instances in which states accept self-bonds for mining operations. In the same month, the OSM also announced that it was beginning the rulemaking process to strengthen regulations on self-bonding.  Although we do not use self-bonding, the elimination or restriction of this option may lead more parties to see third party bonding which could end up restricting supply and increasing our costs of maintaining our bonds.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds of $91.0 million primarily related to these matters. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to obtain additional surety bonds or other forms of financial security. 
 
Clean Air Act 
 
The Clean Air Act and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining operations may occur through Clean Air Act permitting requirements or emission control requirements relating to particulate matter, such as fugitive dust, including future regulation of fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. The Clean Air Act indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-fired electricity generating plants. 
 
Clean Air Act requirements that may directly or indirectly affect our operations include the following: 
 
Acid Rain. Title IV of the Clean Air Act requires a two-phase reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities and applies to all coal-fired power plants generating greater than 25 megawatts of power. The affected electricity generators have sought to meet these requirements by, among other compliance methods, switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices, reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing sulfur dioxide emission allowances. We cannot accurately predict the effect of these provisions of the Clean Air Act on our customers and in turn, on our business in future years. We believe that implementation of the Act has resulted in increasing installations of pollution control devices as a control measure and thus, has created a growing market for our higher sulfur coal. 
Fine Particulate Matter. The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to set standards, referred to as National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”), for criteria pollutants capable of adverse health effects. Areas that are not in compliance with these standards (referred to as “non-attainment areas”) must take steps to reduce emissions levels. The EPA has promulgated NAAQS for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microns, or PM10 and for fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns, or PM2.5. Meeting current or potentially more stringent new PM standards may require reductions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Future regulation and enforcement 
 12
 

of the new PM2.5 standard will affect many power plants and coke plants, especially coal-fired power plants and all plants in non-attainment areas. Continuing non-compliance could prevent issuance of permits to plants within the non-attainment areas.
 
Ozone. Significant additional emissions control expenditures will be required at coal-fired power plants and coke plants to meet the current NAAQS for ozone. Nitrogen oxides, which are a by-product of coal combustion, can lead to the creation of ozone. Accordingly, emissions control requirements for new and expanded coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers and coke plants will continue to become more stringent in the years ahead. In October 2015, the EPA updated the NAAQS for ozone to 70 parts per billion (ppb), down from 75 ppb. EPA has initiated a review of the 2015 rule, which will include the natural sources of ozone and international transport of ozone precursors. Separately, a lawsuit challenging the final rule is pending before the D.C. Circuit. The EPA has the authority to further strengthen ozone standards to protect public health, and the Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the NAAQS. If the NAAQS for ozone becomes more stringent in the future, it could increase the costs of operating coal-fired power plants. 
 
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”). The CSAPR, which was intended to replace the previously developed Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”), requires states to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone or fine particle pollution in other states. Under the CSAPR, emissions reductions were to have started January 1, 2012, for SO2 and annual NOx reductions, and May 1, 2012, for ozone season NOx reductions. Several states and other parties filed suits in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2011 challenging the CSAPR. On August 21, 2012, the D.C. Circuit vacated the CSAPR and ordered the EPA to continue administering CAIR, pending the promulgation of a replacement rule. On April 29, 2014, the United States Supreme Court found that the EPA was complying with statutory requirements when it issued CSAPR and reversed the D.C. Circuit’s vacation of CSAPR. On October 23, 2014, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA’s request to lift the stay on CSAPR. In July 2015 and on remand from the Supreme Court of the United States, the D.C. Circuit upheld the provisions of CSAPR against broad challenges to the rule, but granted certain limited relief to states that brought “as applied” challenges to their respective emissions budgets set by EPA. In November 2015, the EPA issued a proposed CSAPR Rule Update in part to address the D.C. Circuit’s ruling regarding emissions budgets. The Rule Update required implementation of CSAPR’s emission budgets in the 2017 ozone season. In September 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Rule Update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In May 2017, the rule reduced summertime NOx emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern U.S. In September 2017, EPA finalized further revisions to CSAPR to address the D.C. Circuit’s 2015 decision. Litigation against the CSAPR Rule Update is ongoing. It is unclear what effect, if any, CSAPR will have on our operations or results. Because U.S. utilities have continued to take steps to comply with CAIR, which requires similar power plant emissions reductions, and because utilities are preparing to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards regulations which require overlapping power plant emissions reductions, the practical impact of the reinstatement of CSAPR is expected to be limited. However, the cost of compliance with CAIR and now CSAPR could add to pressure to shut down units, which may further adversely affect the demand for our coal.
 
Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (“MATS”). On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the MATS to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants, including mercury, other metals and acid gases, from new and existing coal and oil fired power plants. Under the final rule, existing power plants had up to four years to comply with the MATS by installing or upgrading pollution controls, fuel switching, or using existing emissions controls as necessary to meet the compliance deadline. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the EPA acted unreasonably when it determined that cost was irrelevant to the threshold finding that regulating these emissions was appropriate and necessary. This ruling did not overturn MATS in its entirety or allow previously-installed pollution controls to be removed. The EPA acted to address the Supreme Court ruling by issuing a supplemental finding that a consideration of costs would not change its threshold finding that regulation of these pollutants was appropriate and necessary. This supplemental finding was challenged in the D.C. Circuit.  During that litigation, EPA announced it intended to revisit its supplemental finding.  The D.C. Circuit postponed oral argument and has requested ongoing status reports from EPA.  On December 16, 2018, EPA proposed a revised supplemental finding along with a proposed risk and technology review for the MATS rule.  While EPA proposes to find it is no longer appropriate and necessary to regulate power plants under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, EPA also proposes that MATS remain in place pending any future decision on delisting. These requirements could therefore continue to significantly increase our customers’ costs and to cause them to reduce their demand for coal, which may materially impact our results of operations. In August 2016, the EPA denied two petitions for reconsideration of startup and shutdown provisions in MATS, leaving in place the startup and shutdown provisions finalized in November 2014. The EPA also proposed changes to the electronic reporting requirements for MATS in an effort to streamline e-reporting requirements for power plants and make data about emissions more transparent and accessible to the public. EPA’s actions pertaining to startup and shutdown provisions and e-reporting requirements will have limited impact on coal-fired power plants relative to the overall impact of MATS. 
Greenhouse Gases (“GHG”). Increasing concern about GHG, including carbon dioxide, emitted from burning coal at electricity generation plants has led to efforts at all levels of government to reduce their emissions, which could require utilities to burn less or eliminate coal in the production of electricity. Congress has considered federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions which, among other things, could establish a cap and trade system for GHG, including carbon dioxide emitted by coal burning power plants, and requirements for electric utilities to increase their use of renewable energy such as solar and wind power. Also, the EPA has taken 
 13
 

several recent actions under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions. These include the EPA’s finding of “endangerment” to public health and welfare from GHG, its issuance in 2009 of the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule, which requires large sources, including coal-fired power plants, to monitor and report GHG emissions to the EPA annually starting in 2011, and issuance of its Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which requires large industrial facilities, including coal-fired power plants, to obtain permits to emit, and to use best available control technology to curb GHG emissions. In response to Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit decisions, in August 2016 the EPA issued a proposed rule to revise existing PSD and Title V regulations to ensure that a source is not required to obtain a permit under the regulations solely because of GHG emissions. On September 20, 2013, the EPA proposed new source performance standards (“NSPS”), and in January 2014 issued final rules establishing NSPS, for GHG for new coal and oil-fired power plants, which likely will require partial carbon capture and sequestration to comply. On June 2, 2014, the EPA further proposed new regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities. The EPA issued its final rules, called the Clean Power Plan (“CPP”), in August 2015. Under the CPP, nationwide carbon dioxide emissions from existing plants would be reduced by 32% by 2030, while offering states and utilities flexibility in achieving these reductions. Both the CPP and the NSPS were challenged in the D.C. Circuit by several petitioners. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary stay of the CPP regulations. On September 27, 2016, an en banc panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held oral argument in the case challenging the CPP. The Supreme Court stay will remain in place until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the merits of legal challenges to those regulations, and, if following a ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court is sought and granted, the stay will remain in place until the Supreme Court issues its decision on the merits. 
 
Twenty-five states and other parties filed lawsuits challenging EPA’s final NSPS rule. One of the primary issues in these lawsuits is EPA’s establishment of standards of performance based on technologies including carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”). New coal plants cannot meet the new standards unless they implement CCS, which reportedly is not yet commercially available or technically feasible.  Should EPA’s regulations be upheld by the court, they could materially impact the ability of customers to build new, or modify or reconstruct existing, coal-fired power plants, and thus reduce the demand for coal.
 
On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13783, which called for the review of the CPP and NSPS, and EPA subsequently announced its intent to review these rules.   On October 16, 2017, EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP and on August 31, 2018, proposed the Affordable Clean Energy rule as a replacement to the CPP. Further, on December 20, 2018, EPA proposed revisions to the NSPS.  The D.C. Circuit has granted motions by the EPA to hold the cases challenging the CPP and NSPS in abeyance while the Agency reconsiders the rules.  EPA continues to file status reports in the cases while its rulemaking continues.
 
In addition to the above developments, 195 nations (including the United States) signed the Paris Agreement, a long-term, international framework convention designed to address climate change over the next several decades. This agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise agreed to be bound by the agreement. The United States was among the countries that submitted its declaration of intended greenhouse gas reductions in early 2015, stating its intention to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement.  Certain state and local officials have stated that they will, nevertheless, voluntarily participate in the Paris Agreement. Over the long term, international participation in the Paris Agreement framework could reduce overall demand for coal which could have a material adverse impact on us. These effects could be more adverse to the extent regions of United States ultimately participate in these reductions (whether via the Paris Agreement or otherwise).  
 
Regional Emissions Trading. Nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states have cooperatively developed a regional cap and trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”), intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the region. There can be no assurance at this time that this, or similar state or regional carbon dioxide cap and trade programs (including the Western Climate Initiative, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord and the California Global Warming Solutions Act), in the states where our customers operate, will not adversely affect the future market for coal in the region. 
Regional Haze. The EPA has initiated a regional haze program designed to protect and to improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas and international parks. This program restricts the construction of new coal-fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas. Moreover, this program may require certain existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic chemicals and particulate matter. These limitations could adversely affect the future market for coal. In January 2017, EPA revised its regional haze rules for the second long-term strategy period and, in July 2017, EPA proposed guidance in connection with the rule.  On Jan. 17, 2018, EPA announced it will revisit aspects of the 2017 regional haze rule.

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) 
 
The RCRA affects coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from hazardous waste management. 
Coal Ash Rule. Subtitle C of the RCRA exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the EPA completed a report to Congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous. In 2000, the EPA concluded that coal combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous under the RCRA. Following a large spill of coal ash waste at a coal burning power plant in Tennessee in 2008, the EPA, in 2010, proposed two alternative sets of regulations governing the management and storage of coal ash: one would regulate coal ash and related ash impoundments at coal-fired power plants under federal regulations governing hazardous solid waste under Subtitle C of the RCRA and the other would regulate coal ash as a non-hazardous solid waste under Subtitle D. In December 2014, the EPA announced that it would regulate coal combustion wastes as a nonhazardous substance under Subtitle D of the RCRA rather than as hazard waste pursuant to the provisions of Subtitle C. On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under the solid waste provisions (“Subtitle D”) of RCRA and the finalized regulations became effective on October 19, 2015. While classifying coal combustion waste as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C would have led to more stringent requirements, the new rule could still increase customers’ operating costs and may make coal less attractive for electric utilities. Under the new rule, entities storing coal combustion wastes are susceptible to litigation from citizen groups or other stakeholders. The Coal Ash Rule is currently being challenged in the D.C. Circuit by both environmental and industry groups. The ongoing efforts by environmental groups to expand energy companies’ liability under RCRA could have potential adverse legal and business outcomes for coal-fired power plants. On Dec. 20, 2017, EPA submitted a draft proposed “remand” rule to the Office of Management and Budget for interagency review.  On March 1, 2018, EPA proposed changes to the regulation of coal ash.  EPA's regulatory agenda indicates a final rule will be issued by June 2019.
 
Most state hazardous waste laws exempt coal combustion waste and instead treat it as either a solid waste or a special waste. These laws may also be revised, and the EPA and the U.S. Department of Interior (“DOI”) have indicated that they intend to address placement of coal combustion waste on mine sites in a separate rulemaking. Additionally, in December 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides for the establishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of coal combustion residuals and authorizes states to incorporate EPA’s final rule for coal combustion residuals or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. Any costs associated with handling or disposal of coal ash as hazardous waste would increase our customers’ operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal. In addition, potential liability for contamination caused by the past or future use, storage or disposal of ash could substantially increase. 
 
Clean Water Act of 1972 (“CWA”)
 The CWA established in-stream water quality standards and treatment standards for wastewater discharge through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”). Regular monitoring, reporting requirements and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of pollutants into water. 
 Total Maximum Daily Load. Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations establish a process by which states may designate stream segments as “impaired” (not meeting present water quality standards) and then set pollutant allocation caps designed to restore those segments to attainment.  Those caps then must be translated into NPDES permit limits for contributing pollutant sources.  Industrial dischargers, including coal mines and plants, will be required to meet new TMDL allocations or more stringent water quality standards for these stream segments. The adoption of new TMDLs or more stringent water quality standards in receiving streams could hamper or delay the issuance of discharge and Section 404 permits, and if issued, could require new effluent limitations for our coal mines and could require more costly water treatment, which could adversely affect our coal production or results of operations. States are also adopting anti-degradation policies to designate certain water bodies or streams as “high quality.” These policies would prohibit the degradation of water quality in these streams. Water discharged from coal mines to high quality streams will be required to meet or exceed new “high quality” standards. The designation of high quality streams at or in the vicinity of our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production or results of operations. 
 Waters of the United States. In June 2015, the EPA published its final "Waters of the United States" (“WOTUS”) rule (“2015 Rule”), specifying the waterways that are subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The rule expands the scope of a navigable body of water to include tributaries that contain flowing water for some portion of a year. Although the rule is final, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the rule in October 2015. On January 22, 2018, the Supreme Court unanimously held that initial challenges to this rule belong in district courts rather than appeals courts and the Sixth Circuit’s stay of the 2015 Rule was lifted and existing challenges to the 2015 Rule in various Federal District Courts resumed. The EPA then delayed applicability of the 2015 Rule (through its “Suspension Rule”).  In August 2018, a South Carolina District Court issued an order enjoining EPA’s “Suspension Rule” nationwide, which had the effect of making the 2015 Rule effective 
 15
 

in the states that are not subject to an order of Federal District Courts in Georgia and North Dakota prohibiting implementation of the 2015 Rule. States still subject to the 2015 Rule include Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania.  This has created uncertainty and EPA and the Corps have been addressing implementation issues under the 2015 Rule on a case-by-case basis. 
 Meanwhile, EPA and the Corps continue to move forward with their two-step, repeal and replace process for the 2015 Rule.  In June 2017 and again in June 2018, the agencies proposed to repeal the 2015 Rule.  And in December 2018, the agencies issued their formal proposal to replace the 2015 Rule with a new regulatory definition that would narrow the scope of federally regulated waterways to include only those waters that are oceans, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands, and their “naturally occurring surface water channels.”  The proposal also includes 11 exclusions, including for groundwater, ditches, and water-filled depressions “incidental to mining,” among others.  The next step is publication in the Federal Register, after which the Agencies will accept public comments on the proposal for 60 days.  
 National Enforcement Initiatives. In February 2016, the EPA announced its National Enforcement Initiatives for fiscal years 2017-2019, including an initiative called “Keeping Industrial Pollutants Out of the Nation’s Waters,” which focuses the EPA enforcement resources on certain industrial sectors including mining. Under the initiative, the EPA will use water pollution data to target potential violations of discharge permits and increase the scrutiny of compliance issues. The initiative raises the possibility of stricter permit standards and increased enforcement attention for companies and facilities that discharge wastewater to waters of the U.S. 
 EPA issued a memorandum on August 21, 2018 transitioning EPA’s National Enforcement Initiatives to National Compliance Initiatives in order to recognize the Administration’s focus on compliance rather than enforcement “bean-counting.”  EPA plans to provide additional opportunity for engagement with states and tribes on compliance and to provide additional compliance assurance tools.  EPA is currently seeking comments on its proposed National Compliance Initiatives for fiscal years 2020-2023.  Under the proposed National Compliance Initiatives, EPA plans to transition away from its current “Keeping Industrial Pollutants Out of the Nation’s Waters” initiative to a new initiative focused on NPDES “Significant Non-Compliance (SNC)
 Reduction” including a goal of reducing significant noncompliance by 50 percent by fiscal year 2022.  Notably, all of EPA’s proposed compliance initiatives will focus on environmental and public health risks and will no longer target specific industry sectors.  
 Steam Electric Power Generating Effluent Guidelines. In addition, environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue the EPA for failing to update effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”) under the Clean Water Act for coal-fired power plants to limit discharges of toxic metals from handling of coal combustion waste. In April 2013, the EPA released its proposed revised ELG to address toxic pollutants discharged from power plants, including discharges from coal ash ponds. On November 3, 2015, the EPA issued final revised ELG for the Steam Electric Power Generating category, effective January 4, 2016. These regulations, for the first time, set federal limits on certain metals in wastewater discharges from power plants. Individually and collectively, these regulations could make coal burning more expensive or less attractive for electric utilities and, in turn, impact the market for our products. Several industry groups have filed lawsuits challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The EPA issued an immediate administrative stay, followed by a longer-term postponement of the rule's standards until 2020. This lawsuit remains in abeyance pending reconsideration by the EPA. If the revised Steam Electric Power Generating Effluent Guidelines and the Coal Ash Rule survive legal challenges, they could increase coal plant retirements and costs to the power industry, adversely affecting the future market for coal. 
 Cooling Water Intake Structures. On May 19, 2014, the EPA finalized standards under Section 316(b) of the CWA that require the use of Best Technology Available (“BTA”) for minimizing the injury and death of fish and other aquatic life from cooling-water intake structures at existing power plants.  Because many coal-fired power plants utilize once-through cooling systems that are subject to this rule, implementation of the 316(b) regulations could, in addition to other regulatory burdens, result in further coal plant retirements and adversely affect the future market for coal.  
CERCLA and Similar State Superfund Statutes 
 
CERCLA and similar state laws affect coal mining by creating liability for the investigation and remediation of releases of regulated materials into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Under these laws, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, current and former site owners or operators and others regardless of fault, for all related site investigation and remediation costs.

Permits 
 
Mining companies must obtain numerous permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and safety matters. These provisions include requirements for building dams; coal prospecting; mine plan development; topsoil removal, storage and replacement; protection of the hydrologic balance; subsidence control for underground mines; subsidence and surface drainage control; mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment; and re-vegetation. 
 

Required permits include mining and reclamation permits under the SMCRA (see “U.S. Environmental - The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act”), issued by the IDNR, and wastewater discharge, or NPDES, permits under the CWA, issued by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (“IEPA”).  In addition to the required permits, for surface operations, the mining companies also need to obtain air quality permits from IEPA, fill and dredge permits from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and flood plain permits from the IDNR. For refuse disposal operations, the mining companies may need to obtain impounding permits or underground slurry disposal permits from the IDNR. In addition, MSHA approval for ventilation, roof control and numerous specific surface and underground operations must be obtained and maintained. The authorization and permitting requirements imposed by these and other governmental agencies are costly and may delay development or continuation of mining operations. In December 2014 the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ") released updated draft guidance discussing how federal agencies should consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) evaluations.  On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13783 which, among other things, directed CEQ to rescind its final guidance. While the guidance has been officially withdrawn CEQ has advised agencies that they can still utilize the guidance while it considers how to proceed on future guidance. This type of analyses may increase the likelihood of future challenges to the NEPA documents prepared for actions requiring federal approval. The application review process may take years to complete, and agencies may ask for submission of additional studies, evaluations or other information.  Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance.  Additionally, many environmental laws and regulations provide the public with the opportunity to comment on draft permits, and otherwise engage in the permitting process.   Permit applications are increasingly being challenged by environmental and other advocacy groups.  Accordingly, we may experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits or other necessary approvals, or even face denials of permits altogether. 
 
Currently, we have the necessary permits for mining operations at each of the four complexes. Continued and expanded operations will require additional or renewed permits. These additional permits may include significant permit revisions to the SMCRA mining permit and fill and dredge permits; new NPDES, new SMCRA, new impounding, and possible CWA permits for additional refuse areas; and revisions to the SMCRA permit and a NPDES construction permit for additional bleeder shafts. Due to various and, sometimes, interrelated requirements from different agencies, it is not possible to predict an average or approximate time frame required to obtain all permits and approvals to operate new or expanded mines. In addition, expanded permitting activity in Illinois coupled with challenges from environmental groups will likely increase the various agencies’ permit and approval review time in the future. 
 
Appeals of permits issued by the IEPA, including some CWA permits, are made to the Illinois Pollution Control Board (“IPCB”). The IPCB is an independent agency with five board members appointed by the Governor of the State of Illinois that both establishes environmental regulations under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and decides contested environmental cases. Appeals before the IPCB are based on alleged violations of environmental laws as found in the permit and the accompanying permit record without additional testimony or evidence being taken. Appeals from the IPCB decisions are made to an Illinois appellate court. 
 Requests for an administrative review of permits issued by the IDNR, such as the SMCRA permits, are made to an IDNR hearing officer. Although the basis of the request for the administrative review is the alleged violations in the permit and the permit record, the administrative code rules allow for additional discovery and an evidentiary hearing. Appeals from the IDNR hearing officer’s decisions are made to an Illinois Circuit Court.
