ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
NetPay International, Inc. (the “Company” or "NetPay") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 31, 2016. The Company issued 5,500,000 shares of its common stock to its founder in exchange for organizational services incurred upon incorporation. Upon incorporation, the Company acquired the hair-care formula that its business had been based upon. The Company had been engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of an all-natural organic products collection. The Company sold the rights to certain intellectual property that was the main ingredient in the Company’s hair care collection to a vendor. 
 
Recent Developments
 
On August 29, 2018, the Company experienced a change in control (“Change in Control”). With the Change in Control certain liabilities of the Company were forgiven and/or paid for on behalf of the Company by its founder and former president and chief executive officer. Total liabilities at the time approximated $225,000. The board of directors nominated Mr. Alon Elbaz to the board on August 29, 2018.
 
On August 29, 2018, Mr. Elbaz was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Limor Mamon was appointed as Chief Financial Officer. Both Mr. Elbaz and Ms. Mamon serve in the same capacity for the Company’s majority shareholder, Compunet Holdings AA Ltd. It is the intent of Compunet Holdings to expand its operations to the United States and the North American continent with the Company as its primary operational entity. 
 
On September 17, 2018, the board of directors and a majority of the shareholders of record approved the name change from Allegro Beauty Products, Inc. to NetPay International, Inc. On or about October 16, 2018, the Company mailed an Information Statement to its shareholders. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock executed a written consent in lieu of a special meeting approving the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the name to NetPay International, Inc. The effective date of the name change was November 7, 2018. The Company is rebranding itself as NetPay. 
 
On December 5, 2018, the Company launched its Delaware subsidiary, NetPay (USA), Inc., to act as an independent sales organization (ISO) to seek opportunities related to the provision to merchants of merchant's credit card acquiring clearing, and other value-added services. The services provided by NetPay (USA), Inc. will be different than the payment facilitation business, which will be the core business of the Company. The Company owns ninety percent (90%) of NetPay (USA), with the remaining ten percent (10%) owned by two experienced executives in the credit card services arena.
 
Plan of Operations
 
As of May 10, 2019, we have two employees, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alon Elbaz, and our Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Limor Mamon. NetPay is a development stage company and has little to no financial resources besides shareholder loans. We have not established or attempted to establish a source of equity or debt financing. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain as a going concern.
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had limited assets which consist of cash ($13,898) and prepaid expenses ($1,751). We expect to increase our overall assets over the next few months as we further develop our payment processing business with significant capital investment as well as fixed assets such as computers and sophisticated management information systems to improve and secure our services. In order to fund our business activities over the next 12 months, we will attempt to secure sufficient and satisfactory funding from our majority shareholder, Compunet Holdings AA Ltd., an international Israeli-based company, from Mr. Elbaz, and from others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any funds or that such funds will be offered on terms acceptable to us.
 
Netpay EUR Limited (“Netpay Europe”) is a payment service provider owned by Compunet Holdings AA Ltd. and managed by Mr. Elbaz. Founded in 1998, Netpay Europe has built a successful credit card clearing service based on state-of-the-art technologies. Netpay Europe has evolved over the years to better satisfy and understand the needs of e-commerce and the payment services industry. Netpay Europe acts as a one-stop-shop for e-commerce merchant’s payments needs by providing secure and innovative payment solutions and enhanced payment services.

In order to achieve Netpay Europe’s global business goals, Compunet Holdings AA Ltd., a company controlled by Mr. Alon Elbaz (Netpay Europe’s founder and Chief Executive Officer), acquired the Company, a public traded and reporting company in the United States of America. Under the guidance of Mr. Elbaz and Netpay Europe, the Company believes that it will be able to establish and acquire a payment facilitator license (or PayFac). This will allow the Company to become a sub-merchant account for a merchant service provider in order to provide payment processing services to merchant clients, particularly in the e-commerce marketplace. A payment facilitator license will allow the Company to offer merchant services on a sub-merchant platform. Allowing sub-merchants to be on-boarded under the master of the Company, which will be sponsored by a bank or financial institution.
 
Put simply, the Company has set out to build a payment facilitator model for streamlining merchant services within the U.S. as well as partnering with Netpay Europe’s well-established international business. As a payment facilitator, the Company will eliminate the need for individual merchants to establish a traditional merchant account. In the payment facilitator model, a software provider registers with an acquirer to provide payment services to sub-merchants that utilize its software. By registering as a payment facilitator with an acquirer, the software provider acts as a “master” merchant account provider, including the onboarding of sub-merchants under its own account in order to facilitate payment transactions for the sub-merchants.
 
In this model there are three main parties involved: The acquirer, the payment facilitator (the Company), and the sub-merchant. The acquirer provides overall structure for operations while the Company acts as the go-between with the acquirer and the sub-merchants. The sub-merchants will operate underneath the Company. The acquirer works with the Company to get these sub-merchants running and servicing their payment needs. This includes application administration and the underwriting process, working out pricing agreements and facilitating payment technology integration. The acquirer is responsible for monitoring the Company’s compliance with operating regulations and ensuring due diligence when the Company on-boards (signs-on) sub-merchants. The Company will undergo a comprehensive process in order to register with an acquirer, including integrating the payment technology and infrastructure needed. The Company will assume all risk and liability for its sub-merchants. Industry standards are that sub-merchants sign up with payment facilitators in order to be able to accept payments from their customers.
 
The greatest benefit of the Company’s payment facilitator model will be the ability to simplify and streamline the merchant account enrollment and onboarding process by offering a complete, white-label payment processing solution. This is expected to lead to more control over the processing experience, higher merchant conversion rates, and the opportunity to earn more revenue from credit card processing for the sub-merchant. This process has been implemented by Netpay Europe and its management in Europe, and Netpay Europe intends on providing that knowledge and service to the US market through the Company. 
 
The greatest challenge to the Company’s payment facilitator model will be the level of responsibility the Company as a payment facilitator will be required to assume with the acquirer. This includes greater liability for fraud, chargebacks, and data breaches; the resources to build or purchase payments technology; and the ability to meet compliance mandates and ever-changing regulatory rules.
 
On December 5, 2018, we launched a new Delaware subsidiary, NetPay (USA), Inc., to act as an independent sales organization (ISO) to seek opportunities related to the provision of merchant's credit card acquiring clearing service, and other value-added services. These services to be provided by NetPay (USA), Inc. will be different than the payment facilitation business, which is our core business. To date, Netpay (USA), Inc. has entered into a binding agreement with eData Financial Group LLC, located in Florida, for the resale of merchant's credit card acquiring and processing services, and a memorandum of understanding with Blue Parasol Group LLC for the provision of similar services to that of eData Financial Group and NetPay (USA). We currently own ninety percent (90%) of NetPay (USA), with the remaining ten percent (10%) owned by two highly qualified experienced executives in the credit card payment services industry. We believe that with their expertise and guidance NetPay (USA) will be well-positioned to become an industry leader within the North American market and worldwide. A brief description of the services to be provided by NetPay (USA) is set forth below:
 

NetPay (USA) will act as an independent sales organization (ISO). 
 
NetPay (USA) will seek merchants that will obtain services primarily from us, such as - clearing, providing credit, and other value-added services. 
 
Merchant underwriting. 
 
Managing and monitoring merchant activity, and irregularity resolution. 
 
Margin sharing between the Company and NetPay (USA). 
 
Onboard interface with merchants, e-commerce support, and high-risk merchant assessment. 
 
We anticipate that our new business will begin to generate sales of core services during 2019, although no assurances can be given that we will achieve this goal. The launch of our new business will depend on our ability to obtain sufficient financing.
 
In order to further our plan of operations, we will need to secure additional financing of approximately $3,000,000. If we are not successful in securing this capital, we will not be able to proceed with our business plan as contemplated. Our plan of operations will require us to establish additional sources of capital to fulfill our operational requirements if we do not obtain sufficient financing from our majority shareholder. These funds will go towards building out the US operations to ultimately generate sales. 

6



Alongside the development of our business activities, we will continue to pursue additional sources of financing and attempt to establish a public market for our common stock, which may then allow us to seek financing from sources that would not be available to us if we were private. Accordingly, we believe that we may be able to negotiate from increased strength in pursuing financing or agreements with vendors, manufacturers, and capital sources. We cannot predict the likelihood or timing of any success from our intended actions. 
 
Our goal as stated above is for us to become a leading payment/service facilitator in the United States. We believe that our key alliance with Netpay Europe will assist us in achieving that goal. We currently have no other sources of or commitment for financing beyond a verbal commitment from our majority shareholder and its management personnel. There are no assurances we will obtain sufficient financing or resources from others or enter into beneficial agreements with others in our industry. We believe that we must raise additional capital or debt financing in order to fully execute and implement our business strategy and develop our proposed services.
 
Necessity of Additional Financing
 
Management believes that if it is successful in raising the necessary funds, of which there can be no assurances, we may generate revenue within the next 12 months. While we hope that we will be successful in these efforts, additional equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we would fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We currently received $39,400 in loans from our majority shareholder. We expect that that amount will increase substantially over the next few months as our plan of operations is rolled out. 
 
Securing additional financing is critical to implementation of our timeline. If and when we obtain the required additional financing, we should be able to take our business plan through the necessary steps. In the event we are unable to raise any additional funds we will not be able to pursue our business plan, and we may fail entirely. We currently have no committed sources of financing besides the verbal commitment from our majority shareholder to provide us with financing in the short term until we are able to obtain reliable sources of financing. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We have no patent or trademark applications pending. 

 
Government Regulation and Industry Standards
 
Government regulation may affect key aspects of our business, in the U.S. as well as internationally. In addition, we plan to register with Visa, Mastercard, American Express and the Discover Network as a service provider, and we believe the Company will be subject to their respective rules which will subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions. Set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that we believe will apply to us. These descriptions are not exhaustive and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision, which provisions are subject to change.
Banking Laws and Regulations.
 
Because we intend to provide electronic payment processing services to banks and other financial institutions, we will be subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), an interagency body comprised primarily of federal banking regulators, and also subject to examination by the various state financial regulatory agencies which supervise and regulate the financial institutions for which we provide electronic payment processing and other payment related services. The FFIEC examines large data processors in order to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers, including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry.
Money Transmission, Sale of Checks and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations.

Our business will be subject to money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations. We plan to obtain licenses to operate as a money transmitter, seller of checks and/or provider of payment instruments in at least 48 states and the District of Columbia. Te remaining U.S. jurisdictions do not currently regulate money transmission.

7



In those states where we will be licensed as a money transmitter, seller of checks and/or provider of payment instruments, our Consumer Solutions business will be subject to direct supervision and regulation by the relevant state banking departments or similar agencies charged with enforcement of the relevant statutes and we will be required to comply with various requirements, such as those related to the maintenance of a certain level of net worth, surety bonding, selection and oversight of our authorized agents, maintaining permissible investments in an amount equal to or in excess of our outstanding payment obligations, recordkeeping and reporting and disclosures to consumers. Our Consumer Solutions business will also be subject to periodic examinations by the relevant licensing authorities, which may include reviews of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, various agreements that we will with our issuing banks, distributors and other third parties, privacy and data security policies and procedures and other matters related to our business.
 
Privacy, Information Security, and Other Business Practices Regulation.

Aspects of our business will also be subject, directly or indirectly, to business and trade practices regulation in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere.  For example, in the United States, we and our financial institution clients will be , respectively, subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s and the federal banking regulators’ privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These requirements limit the manner in which personal information may be collected, stored, used and disclosed. The Federal Trade Commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Our financial institution clients in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking regulators. As part of their compliance with these requirements, each of our U.S. financial institution clients is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers and they are also responsible for our compliance efforts as a major service provider.  In many jurisdictions, including every U.S. State, consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach, and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost. The changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which is scheduled to become effective in January 2020, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. In addition, multiple states, Congress and regulators outside the United States are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Information concerning our cybersecurity risks and how a cybersecurity incident could materially affect our business are discussed under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item IA of this annual report under the caption “Security breaches of our systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, may damage client relations, our reputation and expose us to financial liability.” 
Anti-money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulation.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”) has issued a rule regarding the applicability of the Bank Secrecy Act's anti-money laundering provisions to “prepaid access programs.” This rulemaking clarifies the anti-money laundering obligations for entities, such as our Consumer Solutions business and its distributors, engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid access devices like our GPR prepaid cards. We plan to register with FinCEN as a money services business. This registration will result in our having direct responsibility to maintain and implement an anti-money laundering compliance program.
 
We will be subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. In addition, as are all U.S. persons, we will be also subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) which prohibit or restrict financial and other transactions with specified countries and designated individuals and entities such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. We plan to implemenet procedures and controls designed to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries, individuals or entities. We also plan to implement procedures and controls designed to ensure that our processing clients will not have direct business dealings with such prohibited countries, individuals or entities.

The Dodd-Frank Act.

We and the rest of the financial services industry continue to experience increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny, including the enactment of additional legislative and regulatory initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Reform Act”) in 2010. The Reform Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry.  The Reform Act, among other things, provides for the regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board”) of debit interchange fees that are typically paid by acquirers and charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction. In accordance with the Reform Act, the Board capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange fee assessed for debit cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents per transaction plus five basis points, before applying a fraud prevention adjustment of up to an additional one cent. The cap on debit interchange fees has not had a significant negative impact on our business.
 
The Reform Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with responsibility for regulating consumer financial products and services and enforcing most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services, including consumer credit and the prepaid card industry. For example, the CFPB has promulgated a new rule regarding prepaid financial products, which, among other things, will establish new disclosure requirements specific to prepaid accounts, eliminate certain fees that may currently be imposed on prepaid accounts, and make it more difficult for a prepaid card provider such as our Consumer Solutions segment to offer courtesy overdraft protection on prepaid accounts. The rule is scheduled to become effective April 1, 2019.  Similarly, other future actions of the CFPB may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to card issuers, acquirers, consumers and merchants, and thus negatively impact our business.  In addition, the Reform Act created a Financial Stability Oversight Council that has the authority to determine whether nonbank financial companies such as ours would be supervised by the Board because they are systemically important to the U.S. financial system. To date, the Financial Stability Oversight Council does not appear to be focused on regulating entities such as ours.  However, any such future designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business.
 
State Wage Payment Laws and Regulations.

The use of payroll card programs as a means for an employer to remit wages or other compensation to its employees or independent contractors is governed by state labor laws related to wage payments, which laws are subject to change. Part of our future solutions segment may include payroll cards and convenience checks designed to allow employers to comply with applicable state wage and hour laws. Most states permit the use of payroll cards as a method of paying wages to employees, either through statutory provisions allowing such use or, in the absence of specific statutory guidance, the adoption by state labor departments of formal or informal policies allowing for their use. Nearly every state allowing payroll cards places certain requirements and/or restrictions on their use as a wage payment method, the most common of which involve obtaining the prior written consent of the employee, limitations on fees and disclosure requirements.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act.

We will be subject to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and various state laws to the extent we place telephone calls and short message service (“SMS”) messages to clients and consumers. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act regulates certain telephone calls and SMS messages placed using automatic telephone dialing systems or artificial or prerecorded voices.
Escheat Laws.
 
We will be subject to unclaimed or abandoned property laws in the United States and in foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we will be subject to audit by state regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.

United Kingdom's Exit from the European Union​

The United Kingdom is scheduled to exit the European Union on March 29, 2019 (currently delayed until May 22, 2019_ (commonly referred to as "Brexit").  There remains significant uncertainty about the effects of Brexit. Although we currently do not plan to extend our business activities to the European Union, companies operating in or selling into Europe and the United Kingdom would have to consider the potential risks and effects of Brexit, including with respect to:
 

the imposition of UK/EU trade barriers and costs; 
 
changes in manufacturing and operating capacity; 
 
employee retention and movement; and 
 
currency fluctuations; and effects on derivative agreements. 
 
Management believes that Brexit-related issues will not affect our financial statement recognition, measurement or disclosure items, such as inventory write-downs, long-lived asset impairments, collectability of receivables, assumptions underlying fair value measurements, foreign currency matters, hedge accounting or income taxes for the Company and its consolidated financial statements.
 
Employees
 
There is no written employment contract or employment agreement with either Mr. Elbaz, our CEO, or Ms. Mamon, our CFO. We are not actively seeking employees, additional independent contractors or consultants through formal contracts or agreements. This may change in the event that we are able to secure adequate financing through equity or loans. We believe that Mr. Elbaz and Ms. Mamon will continue to provide their services at no cost to the Company. We have no current plans to compensate Mr. Elbaz or Ms. Mamon for their efforts. We intend to use independent contractors and other professional organizations to assist Mr. Elbaz and Ms. Mamon in our business growth, development and roll-out on an as needed basis pending our financial resources. Even then, we may continue to principally rely upon Mr. Elbaz and Ms. Mamon as much as we can. 
Property
 
Our office and mailing address is 2 Hamanofim Street, Herzliya Pituach 46722562 Israel. The space is provided to us by our majority shareholder Compunet Holdings AA Ltd. at no cost. The space is located in Netpay Europe’s business location. Netpay Europe incurs no incremental costs as a result of our using this space. There is currently no written or oral agreement between Compunet Holdings AA Ltd. and the Company for utilizing this space. In addition, on February 27, 2019, we enterd into an agreement with WeWork for the lease of non-exclusive access to office space in New York, NY on a month-to-month basis, commencing on March 1, 2019, for a fee of $700 per month.
Litigation 
 
We are not party to any pending, or to our knowledge, threatened litigation of any type.
