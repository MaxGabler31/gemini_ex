Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Aspen Aerogels, Inc. is an aerogel technology company that designs, develops and manufactures innovative, high-performance aerogel materials used primarily in the energy infrastructure, building materials and electric vehicle markets. We have provided high-performance aerogel insulation to the energy infrastructure and sustainable building materials markets for more than a decade. We have also recently introduced a line of high-potential aerogel thermal barriers for use in battery packs in the electric vehicle market and other energy storage systems. In addition, we are developing applications for our aerogel technology in the battery materials and a number of other high-potential markets. 
 We have historically conducted research related to aerogel technology supported by funding from several agencies of the U.S. government and other institutions in the form of research contracts. We have decided to cease efforts to secure additional funded research contracts and to wind down existing contract research activities.
 When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Aspen Aerogels, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 We design, develop and manufacture innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and sustainable building materials markets. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver the best thermal performance of any widely used insulation product available on the market today and provide a combination of performance attributes unmatched by traditional insulation materials. Our end-user customers select our products where thermal performance is critical and to save money, improve resource efficiency, enhance sustainability, preserve operating assets, and protect workers.
 Our technologically advanced insulation products are principally targeted at the estimated $3.9 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Our aerogel insulation has undergone rigorous technical validation and is used by many of the world’s largest oil producers and the owners and operators of refineries, petrochemical plants, liquefied natural gas facilities and power generating and distribution assets, such as ExxonMobil, Reliance Industries, PTT LNG, and Royal Dutch Shell. Our products replace traditional insulation in existing facilities during regular maintenance, upgrades and capacity expansions. In addition, our aerogel products are increasingly being specified for use in new-build energy infrastructure facilities.
We introduced our two key aerogel insulation product lines for the energy infrastructure market, Pyrogel® and Cryogel®, in 2008. Pyrogel and Cryogel have undergone rigorous technical validation by industry-leading end-users and achieved significant market adoption. We introduced our aerogel insulation product for the building materials market, Spaceloft®, in 2006. Our insulation product revenue has grown from $17.2 million in 2008 to $114.4 million in 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate of 17%. During this period, we have sold nearly $1.2 billion of our insulation products globally, representing an installed base of more than 400 million square feet of insulation. We believe that our long-term record of success positions us for future growth and continued gain in market share in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets.
 We have grown our business by forming technical and commercial relationships with industry leaders, which has allowed us to optimize our products to meet the particular demands of targeted market sectors. We have benefited from our technical and commercial relationships with ExxonMobil in the oil refinery and petrochemical sector, with TechnipFMC in the offshore oil sector, and with BASF in the sustainable building materials market. We will continue our strategy of working with innovative companies to target and penetrate additional opportunities in the energy infrastructure and sustainable building materials markets.
 We are also actively developing a number of promising aerogel products and technologies for the electric vehicle market. We have developed and are commercializing our proprietary line of PyroThin® thermal barriers for use in battery packs of electric vehicles. Our PyroThin product is an ultra-thin, lightweight and flexible thermal barrier designed with other functional layers to impede the propagation of thermal runaway across multiple lithium-ion battery system architectures. Our thermal barrier technology is designed to offer a unique combination of thermal management, mechanical performance and fire protection properties. These properties enable electric vehicle manufacturers to achieve critical battery performance and safety goals.
 In addition, we are seeking to leverage our patented carbon aerogel technology to develop industry-leading battery materials for use in lithium-ion battery cells. These battery materials have the potential to increase the energy density of the battery cells, thus enabling an increase in the driving range of electric vehicles.
 During 2020 and 2021, we entered into multi-year production contracts with a major U.S. automotive manufacturer to supply fabricated, multi-part thermal barriers for use in the battery system of its next-generation electric vehicles. We are currently supplying thermal barrier production parts to both this major U.S. manufacturer and a major Asian automotive manufacturer. We are also supplying thermal barrier prototype parts to a number of other U.S., European and Asian manufacturers of electric vehicles, grid

storage and home battery systems. During 2021, our first full year of serving the electric vehicle and energy storage market, we sold $6.7 million of our PyroThin thermal barriers to ten customers. 
 The commercial potential for our PyroThin thermal barriers and our carbon aerogel battery materials in the electric vehicle market is significant. Accordingly, we are hiring additional personnel, incurring additional operating expenses, incurring significant capital expenditures to expand our aerogel manufacturing capacity, establishing an automated thermal barrier fabrication operation, enhancing research and development resources, and expanding our battery materials research facilities, among other items.
 In addition, our Spaceloft building materials products are increasingly used by building owners to improve energy efficiency and to enhance fire protection in buildings ranging from historic brownstones to modern high rises. We also derive product revenue from a number of other end markets. Customers in these markets use our products for applications as diverse as military and commercial aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. As we continue to enhance our Aerogel Technology PlatformTM, we believe we will have additional opportunities to address high-value applications in the global insulation market, the electric vehicle market and in a number of new, high-value markets, including hydrogen energy, filtration, water purification, and gas sorption.
 Our patented aerogel products and manufacturing technologies are significant assets. Silica aerogels are complex structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. These extremely low-density solids provide superior thermal and acoustic insulating properties. Although silica aerogels are usually fragile materials, we have developed innovative and proprietary manufacturing processes that enable us to produce industrially robust aerogel insulation cost-effectively and at commercial scale. We believe that our electrically conductive carbon aerogel materials are reaching development maturity and expanding our market opportunities in energy storage. These patented carbon aerogels are uniquely strong, providing the physical strength, charge and ion conductivity, and porosity required to host high concentrations of silicon in lithium-ion battery anodes. These silicon carbon aerogels have the potential to lower the costs and increase the energy density of electric vehicle battery systems.
 Our insulation products help end-users to improve resource efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. These products enable compact system design, reduce installation time and costs, promote freight and logistics cost savings, reduce system weight, minimize required storage space and enhance job site safety. Our insulation products reduce the incidence of corrosion under insulation, which is a significant maintenance cost and safety issue in energy infrastructure facilities. Many of our insulation products also offer strong fire protection, which is a critical performance requirement in our markets. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation. Although competing insulation materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel insulation products.
 Our aerogel thermal barrier products are designed to enable our customers to enhance the safety and performance of their lithium-ion battery systems. These barriers are designed to impede the propagation of thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery systems at the battery cell, module and pack levels across multiple lithium-ion battery system architectures. Our ultra-thin, lightweight and flexible thermal barriers are designed to allow battery manufacturers to achieve critical safety goals without sacrificing energy density. We believe we offer the best technology available for the management of thermal runaway in the electric vehicle market.
 Total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $121.6 million, $100.3 million, and $139.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, based on shipment destination or research services location, our U.S. revenue was $66.8 million, $44.8 million, and $58.3 million, respectively, and our international revenue was $54.8 million, $55.5 million, and $81.0 million, respectively.
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have increased our estimated annual revenue capacity in phases to approximately $250.0 million. To meet expected growth in demand for our aerogel products in the electric vehicle market, we are planning to expand our aerogel blanket capacity by constructing a second manufacturing plant in Bulloch County, Georgia. We expect to build the second plant in two phases at an estimated cost of approximately $575.0 million for the first phase and approximately $125.0 million for the second phase. We currently expect that the first phase of the plant will increase our annual revenue capacity by approximately $650.0 million and the second phase by approximately $700.0 million. We expect to have the first phase of the second plant operational late in the second half of 2023. In addition, we are planning to construct and commence operation of a state-of-the-art, automated thermal barrier fabrication operation in Monterrey, Mexico, during 2022, in order to keep pace with the significant potential demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers. 
 In order to manage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we continue to follow safe practices recommended by public health authorities and other government entities. We will continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees, customers and vendors. We have implemented various precautionary measures, including remote work arrangements, restricted 
 4

business travel and procedures for social distancing, face coverings, safe hygiene, and vaccination requirements for all employees. We continue to monitor public health guidance as it evolves and plan to adapt our practices as appropriate. Refer to the section below entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information concerning risks to our business associated with COVID-19.
 Financial information about our product and research services revenues, net loss per share and our total assets are provided in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Markets and Competition
 Our principal market is the energy infrastructure insulation market. This market is global, well-established and includes large and well-capitalized end-users. This market includes companies operating refinery, petrochemical, oil production, and LNG production and storage facilities. The market also includes firms operating gas, coal, nuclear, hydro and solar thermal power generating plants and district energy systems. Insulation systems in the energy infrastructure market are designed to maintain hot and cold process equipment, piping and storage tanks at optimal temperatures, to protect plant and equipment from the elements and from the risk of fire, and to protect workers. The market is served by a well-organized, well-established worldwide network of distributors, contractors, and engineers.
 Demand for insulation in the energy infrastructure market is composed of demand associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, as well as with routine, non-discretionary maintenance programs within existing facilities. Capital expansions and related capital projects in the energy infrastructure market are driven primarily by overall economic growth and projected growth in energy demand. Maintenance programs are essential to optimal operation of process equipment, to protect workers and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic loss. Accordingly, we believe that demand for insulation for maintenance purposes in comparison to capital projects is less affected by volatility associated with economic cycles, energy prices and other macroeconomic factors.
 The major end-user markets that drive demand for our products include oil refining, petrochemical, natural gas and LNG production and storage, onshore oil production, offshore oil production and power generation. Global energy demand is expected to increase in the long-term and, in order to serve this growing demand, we believe our end-user customers will continue to invest in major energy infrastructure projects.
 We have also developed and commercialized a proprietary line of aerogel-based thermal barriers for use in battery packs of electric vehicles and energy storage systems. The market for our thermal barrier products encompasses batteries used in mobile platforms, including automobiles, trucks, buses and light aircraft, and fixed platforms, including home storage, grid storage and other commercial applications. The global lithium-ion battery market was estimated to be more than $40.0 billion in 2021 and continues to grow and evolve rapidly. Our thermal barrier technology offers a unique combination of thermal management, mechanical performance, and fire protection properties that enables electric vehicle manufacturers to achieve critical battery performance and safety goals. We believe that as the e-mobility and energy storage markets require increasingly powerful lithium-ion battery systems, the demand for our aerogel thermal barriers will grow rapidly as the market players seek to reduce the associated risk of thermal runaway.
 We have entered into contracts with a major U.S. automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to supply fabricated, multi-part thermal barriers for use in the production of the battery system of its next-generation electric vehicles. Pursuant to the contracts, we are obligated to supply the barriers at fixed annual prices and at volumes to be specified by the customer up to a daily maximum quantity through the term of the agreements, which expire at various times from 2026 through 2034. While the customer has agreed to purchase its requirement for the barriers from us at locations to be designated from time to time, it has no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of barriers under the contracts. In addition, the customer may terminate the contracts any time and for any or no reason. All other terms of the contracts are generally consistent with the customer’s standard purchase terms, including quality and warranty provisions customary in the automotive industry.
 We also sell our products for use in the sustainable building materials and other end markets, including for the fabrication of insulation parts by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. These OEMs develop products incorporating our aerogel blankets for applications in a diverse set of markets including military aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. While these are not presently our core markets, we anticipate that we will allocate a growing portion of our manufacturing capacity to serve these markets in the long term. We believe the key performance criteria for insulation in these markets and applications include thermal performance, compact design, durability and fire resistance.
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. In the energy infrastructure and sustainable building materials markets, we compete with traditional insulation materials based on product performance, price, availability and proximity to the customer. Customers may choose among a variety of insulation materials that offer a range of characteristics including thermal performance, 
 5

durability, vapor permeability, moisture resistance, ease of installation and upfront and lifecycle costs. Within each type of insulation material, there is also competition between the manufacturers of that material. Most types of traditional insulation materials are produced by a number of different manufacturers and once customers have chosen the type of insulation material that they intend to use, they will choose a manufacturer of that material based primarily on each manufacturer’s price and delivery schedule. Insulation manufacturers include a range of large, high-volume, multinational manufacturers offering branded products and strong technical support services to small, low-volume, local manufacturers offering low prices and limited customer support.
 We believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are:
  
• | product performance (along multiple criteria), quality and fitness for purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product price, installed cost and lifecycle cost;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | product availability; and
--+--------------------------


• | proximity to customer and logistics.
--+-------------------------------------

 Our products are priced at a premium to traditional insulation materials. While our competitors offer many traditional insulation products that are priced below our products on a per-unit basis, we believe our products have superior performance attributes and may have the lowest cost on a fully-installed basis or offer significant life-cycle cost savings.
 Competition in the thermal barrier market is evolving. We believe our patented aerogel thermal barrier technology offers a unique combination of attributes to mitigate thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery systems. These attributes include industry-leading thermal performance, limited combustibility, tunable compressibility and scalable density. We expect to face increasing competition within the thermal barrier market over the next several years as new entrants seek to develop and market their own technologies and solutions.
 We compete in the aerogel materials market with Cabot Corporation, Armacell International S.A., Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech Co., Ltd. and Nano Tech Co., Ltd. and a growing number of other competitors that manufacture, sell or resell aerogel-based insulation products. We expect to face increasing competition in the aerogel insulation market over the next several years as existing competitors and new entrants seek to develop and market their own aerogel products. In addition to other aerogel insulation products, we also encounter competition from innovatively packaged traditional insulation materials that compete with our products based on one or more performance factors. 
 Within each of our target markets, we encounter one or more of these organizations or their resellers and a significant number of other aggressive national, regional and local suppliers of traditional insulation products. Our competitors are seeking to enhance traditional insulation materials and to develop and introduce new and emerging insulation technologies. Competing technologies that outperform our insulation products in one or more performance attributes could be developed and successfully introduced. See “Risk Factors —The insulation markets we serve are highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share and revenues.”
 Our market share in 2021 was approximately 3% of the estimated $3.9 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Our market share in 2021 in the sustainable building materials, thermal barrier, and other markets was either not significant or not measurable. Many of our competitors have greater market presence, larger market share, longer operating histories, stronger name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand volatility within the industry and throughout the economy as a whole, while retaining greater operating and financial flexibility. If our competitors lower their prices, or develop new products with better performance, or if we are unable to compete effectively, our growth opportunities, share of the market, margins and profitability may decline.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Because insulation is used in a wide variety of demanding applications, insulation materials must satisfy a wide range of performance criteria on a cost-effective basis. We believe that our aerogel technology has allowed us to create superior insulation products and will allow us to continue to grow our share of the energy infrastructure, sustainable building materials and thermal barrier markets. We believe that the potential for significant technological innovation in traditional materials is limited and that new high-performance materials will be required to meet evolving market requirements for energy efficient insulation and thermal barrier systems. Our line of high-performance aerogel products is positioned to meet these requirements. Our solutions are driven by our innovative and proprietary technology that produces aerogels in a flexible and industrially robust blanket form. Our solutions also benefit from over 20 years of research and development dedicated to new aerogel compositions, form factors and manufacturing technologies. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver a superior combination of performance attributes that enable energy 
 6

infrastructure and sustainable building materials end-users to save money, improve resource efficiency, preserve operating assets and protect workers across a wide range of applications in our target markets. We believe our patented aerogel thermal barriers offer an industry-leading combination of attributes to mitigate thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery systems. 
 We believe the following combination of capabilities distinguishes us from our competitors and positions us to continue to gain market share in the energy infrastructure, sustainable building materials, and electric vehicle markets:
  
• | Disruptive Products with a Compelling Value Proposition. Our aerogel insulation provides two to five times the thermal performance of widely used traditional insulation in a thin, easy-to-use and durable blanket form. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation and will enable us to gain a larger share of the energy infrastructure insulation market. In addition, our aerogel thermal barriers offer a combination of attributes that provide industry-leading protection against thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. We believe our thermal barriers provide the market-leading technological solution to combat thermal runaway and will help us gain share within the market for lithium-ion batteries used in the e-mobility and grid storage markets. Although competing materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation or thermal barrier material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel products.

Our Aerogel Products
 Silica aerogels are highly porous structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. Silica aerogels are a very low-density solids and are extremely fragile materials. However, our proprietary manufacturing process produces silica aerogels in a flexible, resilient, durable and easy-to-use blanket form.
 The core raw material in the production of our aerogel insulation products is silica precursors. Our manufacturing process initially creates a semi-solid alcogel in which the silica structure is filled with ethanol. We produce aerogel by means of a supercritical extraction process that removes ethanol from the gel and replaces it with air. Our process allows the ethanol to be extracted without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary forces.
 Our material costs were 48%, 44%, and 48% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We seek to lower our manufacturing costs, while maintaining appropriate performance characteristics, and to improve the per square foot costs of our silica aerogel blankets by optimizing our formulations to reduce material costs, by enhancing manufacturing process controls to improve yields, by realizing price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors and by reducing shipping costs. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive position and to ensure we deliver high quality products to our customers.
 The materials used in the production of our silica aerogel products consist primarily of several silica precursors, fiber batting, and other additives. The markets for these materials are generally competitive and multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials. However, from time-to-time, we have experienced a significant increase in the price of certain silica precursors due to supply imbalances in the silanes market. We are actively working to reformulate our products to reduce our reliance on the materials that are susceptible to significant price fluctuations. We are also working to expand the geographic diversity of our supply base to reduce the risk of demand and supply imbalances in any one country or region.
 We purchase silica precursors from several suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia, including China. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors will be available at competitive prices. Suppliers of silica precursors include industrial companies that produce the materials directly or that produce them as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of these suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop our processes to reduce the long-term cost impact of these materials. We are also considering investing in the technology and the capital assets required to produce certain critical silica precursors in our planned aerogel manufacturing facility in Bulloch County, Georgia. See “Risk Factors — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”
 Our aerogel blankets are reinforced with fiber batting. We manufacture and sell our blankets in 60-inch-wide, three-foot diameter rolls with a standard range of thickness of two millimeters to ten millimeters. Our base products are all flexible, hydrophobic, vapor permeable, compression resistant and able to be cut and fabricated using conventional tools. We have specifically developed our line of aerogel blankets to meet the requirements of a broad set of applications within our target markets. The composition and attributes of our standard aerogel blankets are described below:

 R-Values by Material
 Insulation is a material or combination of materials that slows the transfer of heat from one side of the material to the other. The composition of our aerogel products minimizes the three mechanisms of thermal transport:
  
• | Conduction. Heat conduction through a material is correlated to the material’s density. Aerogels are very low-density solids. As a result, thermal conductivity through the aerogel material itself is extremely low.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convection. Heat convection in gases is through movement of gas molecules. Due to the restricted movement of gases in the nanoporous aerogel structure, thermal convection is eliminated inside the aerogels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Radiation. Radiation requires no medium to transfer the heat. Thermal radiation is partially absorbed by aerogels. Our aerogel products also contain infrared absorbing additives to reduce radiant heat transfer significantly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our aerogel products offer the lowest levels of thermal conductivity, or best insulating performance, of any widely used insulation or thermal barrier available on the market today.
 The lower a material’s thermal conductivity, the more slowly heat is transferred through the material. R-values are a commonly used measure of an insulating material’s resistance to heat transfer. R-value is calculated as the thickness of an insulation material divided by the thermal conductivity of the insulation material. Materials with higher R-values have lower thermal conductivity and are better insulators. Traditional and specialty insulation materials provide a range of R-values. Aerogels have the highest R-value per unit of thickness in comparison to traditional insulation materials.

Qualification for Use
 Our products have undergone rigorous testing and are now qualified for global usage in both routine maintenance and in capital projects at many of the world’s largest oil producers, refiners, and petrochemical companies, and within the next-generation lithium-ion battery systems of two of the largest global automotive manufacturers. These end-users of our products have well-defined practices, codes, specifications and standards for materials and systems installed in their vehicles or used in their facilities. These specifications include system design standards, material qualification and selection processes, insulation application practices, and quality control requirements. As part of the material qualification process established by these companies, a new insulation or thermal barrier product must meet general industry standards, such as consensus standards developed by ASTM International, and, in many cases, company-specific internal standards to be considered and approved for use or designed into vehicle platforms. In addition, most of these companies require one or more field trials of tests to evaluate fitness for use in specific applications. These companies either run these qualification processes and field trials internally or through third parties engaged by them, and they generally do not publicly disclose the results of their testing. While the specific processes and timelines vary from company to company, in general, upon successful completion of the qualification process for an insulation or thermal barrier product, an end-user will typically deem the product to be qualified for use in its facilities on a local, regional or global basis for one or more applications or vehicles. Because our end-user customers are typically businesses with very large operations in multiple sites, our insulation or thermal barrier sales likely represent only a small portion of the total product used by any one of these companies. Accordingly, once our products are qualified or designed into a platform at a specified company, we continue to seek to expand the use of our products by the end-use customer in additional applications, platforms, locations or vehicles.
Our Sales Channel
 We market and sell our products primarily through our global sales force. Our sales personnel are based in North America, Europe and Asia and travel extensively to market and sell our products to new and existing customers. The efforts of our sales force are supported by a small number of sales consultants with extensive knowledge of a particular market or region. Our sales force establishes and maintains customer and partner relationships, delivers highly technical information and provides first-class customer service. We plan to expand our sales force and business development resources globally to support anticipated growth in customers and demand for our products.
 Our sales force calls on and maintains relationships with participants at all levels of the energy infrastructure supply chain. We have established a network of insulation distributors to ensure rapid delivery of our products in critical regions. Our sales personnel work to educate insulation contractors about the technical and operating cost advantages of aerogel blankets. Our sales force also works directly with end-users and engineering firms to promote qualification, specification and wider acceptance of our products in existing and new applications. In the energy infrastructure market, we rely heavily on the existing and well-established channel of distributors and contractors to deliver products to our customers. In addition, our sales and business development personnel work directly with OEMs and strategic partners, including within the electric vehicle industry, to create new product designs and solutions to expand our market reach.
 The sales cycle for a new insulation material or thermal barrier is typically lengthy. Our sales cycle from initial customer contact to widespread use can take from one to three years, although we typically realize increasing revenue at each stage in the cycle. We believe our relationships with technically sophisticated customers and strategic partners serve to validate our technology, products and value proposition within a target market. These relationships have proven to accelerate the sales cycle with other customers within specific markets and to facilitate growth in market share. We have focused our marketing efforts on developing technical support materials, installation guides, case studies and general awareness of the superior performance of our aerogel blankets and thermal barriers. We rely principally on our website, social media, printed technical materials, participation in industry conferences and tradeshows and presentation of technical papers to communicate our message to existing and potential customers. We also receive strong word-of-mouth support from the growing network of distributors, installation contractors, OEMs, strategic partners and end-users that understand the benefits of our products.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 63 sales and marketing professionals worldwide. Their efforts were supported by a team of ten sales consultants.

Our Customers and End-Users
 Customers
 Energy Infrastructure
 Our primary customers in the energy infrastructure market are distributors, installation contractors and fabricators that stock, install and customize insulation products, components and systems for technically sophisticated end-users that require high-performance insulation.

• | Distributors: We currently operate through a global network of 68 insulation distributors. In general, insulation distributors stock, sell and distribute aerogel materials to insulation contractors and end-users. The distribution of our product outside of the United States is at times conducted under agreements that provide for exclusivity by geography linked to annual purchase volume minimums. These insulation distributors typically market, promote and advertise our aerogel materials across their market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contractors: We currently sell directly to a number of insulation contractors under project specific contracts or general purchase orders. Insulation contractors generally perform insulation installation, inspection, maintenance and project management for end-users. In addition, some insulation contractors provide end-users with project engineering and design services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electric Vehicle and Energy Storage
 Our customers in the evolving electric vehicle and energy storage markets include electric vehicle manufacturers, Tier 1 automotive suppliers, lithium-ion battery manufacturers, and e-mobility and energy storage companies. Our existing and prospective customers range from start-ups to the largest automotive manufacturers in the world.
 We typically supply thermal barrier products to our automotive OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by the OEM. The terms and conditions typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum quantity of products from us. We expect that these relationships will typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
 Individual purchase orders from our automotive OEM customers are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, our automotive OEM customers often have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program, and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts.
 Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of automotive OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.
 Additional Customer Information
 Distribution International, Inc. represented 28% of our total revenue in 2021 and was our only customer representing 10% or more of our revenue for that period.
 12

Our product revenue is generated by sales to customers around the world. In 2021, 55% of our product revenue was generated in the United States, 23% in Europe, 16% in Asia, 4% in Latin America, and 2% in Canada based on shipment destination.
 A substantial portion of our sales are to shipment destinations located outside of the United States, including France, Norway, Thailand, Russia, Canada, Germany, Taiwan, Great Britain, Columbia, and South Korea. Total revenue generated from outside of the United States amounted to $54.8 million or 45% of total revenue, $55.5 million or 55% of total revenue and $81.0 million or 58% of total revenue, in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we may continue to expand our operations outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks. See “Risk Factors — A substantial portion of our revenue comes from sales in foreign countries and we may expand our operations outside of the United States, which subjects us to increased economic, foreign exchange, operational and political risks that could increase our costs and make it difficult for us to operate profitably.”

We believe our customer base will expand in the near term to include additional electric vehicle manufacturers, Tier 1 automotive suppliers, lithium-ion battery manufacturers, and e-mobility and energy storage companies.
 Our carbon aerogel program seeks to increase the performance of lithium-ion battery cells to enable electric vehicle manufacturers to extend the driving range and reduce the cost of electric vehicles, among other uses. We are targeting the manufacturers of battery components, batteries, grid battery systems, and electric vehicles as potential customers for our carbon aerogel materials.
 Sustainable Building Materials and Other Markets
 Traditionally, we have relied on the efforts of a small network of partners, OEMs and fabrication houses to serve the sustainable building materials, transportation, apparel and appliance markets. These partners, OEMs and fabricators are manufacturers of components and systems for buildings, refrigerated and hot appliances, cold storage equipment, automobiles, aircraft, trains, 
 13

electronics, and outdoor gear and apparel. The end-users of our products in these markets include a wide range of institutions, businesses, individuals, municipalities and government agencies.
 Manufacturing
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility located in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased manufacturing capacity and productivity during the period. Our manufacturing process is proven and has been scaled to meet increasing demand.
 Our manufacturing group is led by a seasoned team with management experience at global industrial and specialty chemical companies. Our manufacturing workforce is skilled and we have experienced employee turnover consistent with our industry. We have well-defined operating processes and maintenance, environmental, health and safety programs to support our operations. We employ statistical processes and quality controls in our manufacturing systems. We routinely measure and monitor thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and other key properties of the aerogel blankets produced in our manufacturing operations. We are ISO 9001:2015 certified.

 We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have increased our capacity in phases since that time. To meet expected growth in demand for our aerogel products in the electric vehicle market, we are planning to expand our aerogel blanket capacity by constructing a second manufacturing plant in Bulloch County, Georgia. We expect to build the plant in two phases with the first phase operational late in the second -half of 2023. In addition, we are planning to construct a state-of-the-art, automated thermal barrier fabrication operation in Monterrey, Mexico in order to keep pace with the significant potential demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers. 
 We directly control all stages in the manufacture of our aerogel blankets. Our direct ownership of manufacturing operations allows us to maintain control of proprietary process technologies and to control product quality. Our production of aerogel blankets utilizes a continuous process and consists of the following key steps:
  
• | Sol Preparation. Mixing of silica precursors in ethanol, a catalyst and additives in set formulas to deliver the target properties of the resultant aerogel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casting. Combination of the sol and fiber batting and initial formation of the gel structure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aging. Bathing of the gel blankets in fluids to impart desired physical and thermal properties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extraction. Supercritical extraction of the ethanol liquid from the gel blanket to produce a dried aerogel blanket.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Heat Treatment. Drying to remove trace ethanol, salts and water from the aerogel blankets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finishing. Coating to enhance quality and product handling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fabrication. Cutting, lamination, and production of components and multi-layer systems for custom applications in the electric vehicle and subsea markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality Control. Utilizing statistical process and quality controls to measure thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and other key properties of our aerogel products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our material costs were 48%, 44%, and 48% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 The materials used in the production of our products consist primarily of several silica precursors, fiber batting, and other additives. The markets for these materials are generally competitive and multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials. However, from time-to-time, we have experienced a significant increase in the price of certain silica precursors due to a supply imbalance in the silanes market. We are actively working to reformulate our products to reduce our reliance on materials that are susceptible to significant price fluctuations. We are also working to expand the geographic diversity of our supply base to reduce the risk of demand and supply imbalances in any one country or region.
 We purchase silica precursors from several suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia, including China. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that the long-term supply of silica precursors will be available at competitive prices. Suppliers of silica precursors include industrial companies that produce the materials directly or that produce them as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop our processes to reduce the long-term cost impact of these materials. We are also considering investing in the technology and the capital assets required to produce certain critical silica precursors in our planned aerogel manufacturing facility 
 14

in Bulloch County, Georgia. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”
 We seek to lower our manufacturing costs, while maintaining appropriate performance characteristics, and to improve the per square foot costs of our aerogel blankets by optimizing our formulations to reduce material costs, by enhancing manufacturing process controls to improve yields, by realizing price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors and by reducing shipping costs. In addition, we believe additional opportunities to realize production efficiencies and to reduce per unit overhead costs will arise with growth in the scale of our manufacturing operations. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive advantage and to ensure we deliver high quality finished products to our customers. 
 Research and Development
 The mission of our research and development team is to leverage our aerogel technology platform in support of our commercial objectives. In our existing markets, research and development personnel design new and improved insulation and thermal barrier products to enhance our value to customers and to expand our revenue potential. Our materials scientists and engineers also seek to develop enhanced chemical and process technologies to improve yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve product performance. In new markets, research and development personnel seek to exploit the unique characteristics of aerogels, including low thermal conductivity, high surface area, high electrical conductivity, and tunable porosity, to develop aerogel-enhanced products and next generation technology addressing complex and unmet market needs. 
 Our research and development expenditures were $11.4 million, $8.7 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we spent $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on research and development activities sponsored by federal and other government agencies. 
 Contract Research and Government Support
 We have received funding from a number of government agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other institutions, in support of our research and development and manufacturing activities. We have also worked closely with customers in government and industry to develop potential aerogel solutions that leveraged not only the thermal insulation performance but other benefits of aerogels as well. 
 In late 2019, we decided to wind down our existing contract research activities. This decision reflected our desire to focus our research and development resources on initiatives to improve the profitability of our existing business and on efforts to develop new products and next generation technology with application in new, high value market segments. 
 We have received $59.2 million in funding under government contracts from our inception through December 31, 2021. Our contract research revenue was $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $2.4 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights that cover our aerogel technology platform, including, product forms, applications and/or manufacturing technologies and the technology or know-how that enables these product forms, applications, technologies and specifications, to avoid and defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and to prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Since aerogels were developed more than 80 years ago, there has been a wide range of research, development and publications on aerogels and related technologies, which make it difficult to establish intellectual property rights to many key elements of aerogel technology and to obtain meaningful patent protection. Where appropriate, we seek to protect our rights by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other key foreign jurisdictions related to products, processes, technology and improvements that we consider patentable and important to our business and, in particular, our aerogel technology, product forms and their applications in promising markets and our manufacturing technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, licensing agreements, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and continuing technological innovation to safeguard our intellectual property rights and develop and maintain our competitive edge.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned 63 issued U.S. patents, 45 pending U.S. patent applications (including eight issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application that we co-own with third parties), 130 issued foreign patents, 136 pending foreign patent applications (including 28 issued foreign patents and five pending foreign patent applications that we co-own with third parties), and one allowed foreign patent. The patents that we own are generally effective for 20 years from the filing date of the 
 15

earliest application to which each U.S. patent claims priority. The scope of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. Our early product patent family covering a fiber-reinforced aerogel composition expired in December 2021.
 In May 2016, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Nano Tech Co., Ltd. (Nano), and Guangdong Alison Hi Tech., Ltd. (Alison) in the International Trade Commission, or ITC. In February 2018, the ITC issued its final determination that Nano and Alison had infringed asserted Aspen patents and that they have not proven the patents are invalid except with respect to one dependent product claim, which the ITC found was not infringed. The ITC affirmed that Alison and Nano each violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act and issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting importation of infringing aerogel insulation products manufactured by Alison and Nano. Alison’s appeal with respect to a product patent to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) was rejected, and resulted in CAFC affirming the validity of our patent. The exclusion order, which is enforced by the United States Customs and Border Protection, is currently in effect. 
 Additionally, the USPTO denied Alison’s requests to invalidate the claims of four of our patents in Inter-Partes Review. Alison also filed multiple similar requests with the Chinese Patent Office (SIPO), seeking to invalidate our Chinese manufacturing process patents and two of our Chinese product patents. With respect to one of those requests, not withdrawn previously by Alison, the Patent Review Board of SIPO (PRB), issued a decision upholding the validity of Aspen’s issued patent as amended in the proceedings. Alison has appealed the PRB’s decision to the Beijing IP court. On July 25, 2020, the Beijing IP court dismissed Alison’s appeal and upheld the validity of Aspen’s patent and we received this decision on September 15, 2020. Nano has also filed a request seeking invalidation of a product patent at SIPO. After the oral hearing at PRB, Nano withdrew its invalidation request. On September 23, 2019, Alison filed yet another request to invalidate the same patent, whose validity was previously confirmed by PRB. On January 23, 2020 PRB denied Alison’s latest invalidation request. 
 In April 2016, we also filed a patent infringement suit at the District Court in Mannheim, Germany (Mannheim court), against Nano, Alison and two European resellers asserting their infringement of one of our German patents. We subsequently asserted infringement of another three patents against Nano, Alison and a European reseller of Alison’s products at the Mannheim court. We have since settled with one European reseller in exchange for a commitment not to procure infringing products and cooperation with our case. 
  
• | In January 2018, the court issued a series of judgments by acknowledgement (German, “Anerkenntnisurteil”) finding the second reseller, Hiltex, liable for infringement and also issued injunctions against Hiltex. The judgments resulted from a settlement agreement in which Hiltex agreed not to resell the infringing products in Europe where at least one of the asserted patents are active.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On March 8, 2019, the Mannheim court issued two separate judgments in cases against Nano and Alison, respectively. The Mannheim court determined that both Nano and Alison are infringing on Aspen’s EP1638750 (750 Patent) in connection with their respective products. The court also issued injunctions prohibiting the offer, putting on the market, using, importing or possessing the infringing products. The court found the defendants liable to us for damages since September 22, 2012. The court also ordered the defendants to provide information on the scope of the acts of infringement committed since August 22, 2012, and a recall of infringing products. The court ordered Nano and Alison to bear the costs of the legal proceedings and reimburse statutory attorneys’ costs and expenses to us, that exact amount of which is yet to be determined. Nano and Alison have appealed the judgments of the Mannheim court. Nano subsequently withdrew the appeal while Alison’s appeal is currently pending.

• | The Mannheim court issued two decisions on December 23, 2019 finding that Alison infringed the 577 Patent and the 950 Patent and also issued injunctions prohibiting Alison from continuing infringement in connection with any aerogel sheets. The December 2019 decisions against Alison have now become final and binding.

• | The Mannheim court issued two decisions on July 31, 2020 finding that Nano infringed each of the 577 Patent and the 950 Patent. In addition to granting other remedies, the court also issued injunctions prohibiting the offer, putting on the market, using, importing or possessing any aerogel sheets. After the passing of deadline to file appeals, these decisions have now become final.

• | Nano and Alison also initiated nullity actions in German Federal Patent Court in Munich against our asserted German patents. On September 25, 2018, the Federal Patent Court in Munich dismissed the challenge to the validity of 750 Patent which has subsequently become final. Nano and Alison also filed an opposition to one of the asserted patents at the EPO. In December 2018, the opposition division of EPO determined the patent, EP2813338 (338 Patent), was invalid on formality grounds and decided to revoke it. Upon our appeal of the opposition division’s decision and after conducting an oral hearing on January 21, 2021, the Board of Appeals of EPO set aside the opposition division’s December 2018 decision based on amended set of claims and remitted the case back to the opposition division for further prosecution.

• | On March 19 and 20, 2019 the German Federal Patent Court in Munich (FPC) conducted oral proceedings and voided four claims in EP2415577 (577 Patent) and confirmed the validity of challenged claims in EP2422950 (950 Patent) within the scope of silica gels. These FPC judgments are now final and binding on the parties. Nano had filed another nullity action seeking to invalidate the remaining claims in the 577 Patent which action Nano subsequently failed to pursue.

• | On June 17, 2020, Nano also filed an opposition to a recently issued Aspen Patent EP3120983B1, titled “Continuous Sheet of Gel Materials and Continuous sheet of Aerogel”. (983 Patent). On December 22, 2021, based on the oral hearing conducted on November 12, 2021, opposition division of EPO found the amended claims of 983 Patent to be valid. This decision is further subject to an appeal to the Board of Appeals within two months of the notification of the opposition division’s decision.

• | On January 28, 2021, a search order was executed and relevant evidence secured at the principal places of business of AMA S.p.A. and AMA Composites S.r.l. (collectively, AMA) in San Martino in Rio and Campogalliano, respectively, based on an ex-parte search order issued by the Court of Genoa, Italy at our request in connection with alleged infringement of the Italian part of our patents previously asserted successfully against Nano and Alison in Germany. The Court of Genoa subsequently held a hearing and confirmed the validity of the search order and its execution. While the search proceedings do not take a position on the infringement issues, we may use any evidence collected during the search proceedings to prove infringement. As a result, on May 3, 2021, we filed an infringement complaint, a writ of summons, as known in Italy, at the Court of Genoa alleging that AMA has infringed the Italian part of three European patents (same patents asserted in the German litigation) and a patent on composition of aerogel-based composites in connection with AMA’s resale of aerogel products supplied by Chinese companies and sale of any products derived therefrom. We are seeking monetary damages and preliminary injunction of AMA’s alleged infringing activities. We expect the Court of Genoa to assess our claims and AMA’s defense through appointment of an expert after the submission of relevant writs and evidence. We issued a press release on May 6, 2021 describing the patent enforcement action of May 3, 2021 (Press Release). On June 7, 2021, AMA served us a copy of a request it previously filed with the Court of Genoa seeking an ex-parte preliminary injunction (PI) against us alleging the Press Release constituted anti-competitive conduct and that it infringed AMA’s trademark rights. The service of the request followed the court’s prior denial of the ex-parte order and an order requiring AMA to serve the request on us. The court subsequently conducted an oral hearing on June 15, 2021. On June 24, 2021, the court denied AMA’s request for a PI, reasoning that our Press Release was factually accurate, was not misleading, distinguished facts from opinions and that it was neither anti-competitive nor did it infringe trademark rights of AMA. The Court also ordered AMA to pay certain of our legal fees. On July 5, 2021, AMA informed us that it has decided not to appeal the denial of June 24, 2021. We subsequently learned that AMA had also made a criminal complaint against our chief executive officer for defamation in connection with the Press Release. On December 31,2021, the local prosecutor, after reviewing the underlying facts, rejected AMA’s arguments and requested the judge overseeing the matter to dismiss the complaint against our chief executive officer. In response to our infringement complaint, AMA has also added as a counter-claim in connection with its claims regarding the Press Release, those same claims that it previously sought a preliminary injunction that was denied by the court. The patent infringement proceedings are ongoing.

 Additionally, a reseller of Nano’s products in Taiwan challenged the validity of one of our patents in Taiwan in 2018. After careful review of our written response, the Taiwanese patent office has determined the patent as valid and dismissed the challenge in December 2018. In 2018, LG Chem Ltd. challenged the validity of one of our patents in Korea at the IPTAB of the Korean Intellectual Property Office. After conducting an oral hearing, the IPTAB issued a decision on November 30, 2019 upholding claims related to aerogel sheets incorporating fibers. On January 14, 2021, the Korean Patent Court confirmed the validity of the claims related to aerogel sheets incorporating fibers. 
 Due to their nature, it is difficult to predict the outcome or the costs involved in any litigation. Furthermore, our adversaries may have significant resources and interest to litigate and therefore, these litigation matters could be protracted and may ultimately involve significant legal expenses. We have incurred approximately $9.7 million of expenses related to this litigation since 2015 through December 31, 2021. In addition to the foregoing, we have been and may be from time-to-time party to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and to other patent enforcement actions to assert our patent rights.
 We believe that having distinctive names is an important factor in marketing our products, and therefore we use trademarks to brand some of our products, including Pyrogel, PyroThin, Cryogel and Spaceloft. As of December 31, 2021, we had seven trademark registrations in the United States, two trademark registrations with the World Intellectual Property Organization, and 71 trademark registrations in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and Brazil. Additionally, we had three pending US trademark applications and eleven pending foreign trademark applications. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, our approach may not be comprehensive and we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration.

Cross License Agreement with Cabot Corporation
 In April 2006, we entered into a cross license agreement with Cabot Corporation, as amended in September 2007, in which each party granted certain intellectual property rights to the other party. The cross license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last to expire of the issued patents or patent applications and acquired patents licensed thereunder. We hold a non-exclusive, worldwide license to those patents and patent applications owned or licensed by Cabot that are necessary for us to (i) practice our manufacturing technology within a field of use, which is defined in accordance with the specific chemistry of our aerogel products and the supercritical fluid technology that we use in our manufacturing technology and (ii) use and sell the resulting aerogel blanket and derivative products. We paid Cabot $38 million over a period of approximately seven years, with the last payment made in March 2013, in connection with this license agreement. We have granted to Cabot a reciprocal, non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications that we own that are necessary for Cabot to practice its processes within a field of use defined in accordance with the specific chemistry in its aerogel products and the drying technology that it uses to manufacture its products. The grant of license to each party covers issued patents, patent applications and patents issued from such counterpart applications, as well as patents licensed or acquired during a specified period, in each case that claim aerogels, or methods, materials of manufacture, or uses of aerogels.

Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 418 full-time employees with 57 in research and development, 257 in manufacturing operations and supply chain, 63 in sales and marketing and 41 in general and administrative functions. Of our employees, 397 are located in the United States and 21 are located abroad. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be of good standing. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or have collective bargaining agreements.
Compensation and Benefits
 We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Technology companies both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for every employee. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on performance. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values. 
 Protection and Support of Our Employees during the COVID-19 Pandemic
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and are following safe practices recommended by public health authorities and other government entities. We continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees. In addition, we have implemented various precautionary measures, including remote work arrangements, restricted business travel and procedures for social distancing, face coverings and safe hygiene. We continue to monitor public health guidance as it evolves and plan to adapt our practices as appropriate. Refer to the section below entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information concerning risks to our business associated with COVID-19.
 Seasonality
 Our energy infrastructure product offerings make us less susceptible to seasonal patterns as our operating results are generated in part by demand for insulation associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, and larger maintenance-related projects in the energy infrastructure market. Historically, our third and fourth quarter results have shown increased levels of revenue, which we believe is associated with our end-user customers’ maintenance schedules and timing of capital projects. As we pursue and grow revenue opportunities in the electric vehicle market, we expect that a portion of our revenues may be subject to seasonal patterns typical of automotive suppliers.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations. See “Risk Factors — We may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and related claims, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
