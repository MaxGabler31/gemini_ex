ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Ducommun Incorporated (“Ducommun,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading global provider of engineering and manufacturing services for high-performance products and high-cost-of failure applications used primarily in the aerospace and defense (“A&D”), industrial, medical and other industries (collectively, “Industrial”). Ducommun differentiates itself as a full-service solution-based provider, offering innovative, value-added proprietary products and manufacturing solutions to our customers in our primary businesses of electronics, structures, and integrated solutions. We operate through two primary business segments: Electronic Systems and Structural Systems. We are the successor to a business that was founded in California in 1849 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1970.
ACQUISITIONS
Acquisitions have been an important element of our growth strategy. We have supplemented our organic growth by identifying, acquiring and integrating acquisition opportunities that result in broader, more sophisticated product and service offerings while diversifying and expanding our customer base and markets.
For example, on December 16, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Magnetic Seal LLC (f/k/a Magnetic Seal Corporation, “MagSeal”), a privately-held leading provider of high-impact, military-proven magnetic seals for critical systems in aerospace and defense applications, offering sealing solutions that are engineered to perform in high-speed, high-vibration, and other challenging environments for $69.5 million, net of cash acquired. A portion of the purchase price was funded by drawing down on our revolving credit facility. This draw down on our revolving credit facility was paid off by December 31, 2021. The acquisition of MagSeal will continue to advance our strategy to diversify and offer more customized, value-driven engineered products with aftermarket opportunities, and is included in our Structural Systems segment.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE END-USE MARKETS OVERVIEW
Our largest end-use markets are the aerospace and defense markets and our revenues from these markets represented 94% of our total net revenues in 2021. These markets are serviced by suppliers which are stratified, from the highest value provided to the lowest, into four tiers: original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), Tier One, Tier Two, and Tier Three. The OEMs provide the highest value and are also known as prime contractors (“Primes”). We derive a significant portion of our revenues from subcontracts with OEMs. As the prime contractor for various programs and platforms, the OEMs sell to their customers, who may include, depending upon the application, the U.S. Federal Government, foreign, state and local governments, global commercial airline carriers, regional jet carriers and various other customers. The OEMs also sell to global leasing companies that lease commercial aircraft. A significant portion of our revenues is earned from subcontracts with the Primes. Tier One suppliers manufacture aircraft sections and purchase assemblies. Tier Two suppliers provide more complex, value-added parts and may also assume more design risk, manufacturing risk, supply chain risk and project management risk than Tier Three suppliers. Tier Three suppliers principally provide components or detailed parts. We currently compete with Tier One, Tier Two, and Tier Three suppliers. Our business growth strategy is to differentiate ourselves from competitors by providing more complex assemblies to our customers as a higher value added supplier.
Commercial Aerospace End-Use Market
The commercial aerospace end-use market is highly cyclical and is impacted by the level of global air passenger traffic in general, which in turn is influenced by global economic conditions, fleet fuel and maintenance costs and geopolitical developments. Revenues from the commercial aerospace end-use market represented 24% of our total net revenues for 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause an unprecedented adverse impact to demand for civil air travel, creating a significant challenge for some of our customers and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. As the number of infections from COVID-19 continues to decline in various parts of the world, along with the increase in the number of people being fully vaccinated, it should result in the steady increase in consumer confidence on the safety of air travel. The latest International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) release reported that passenger traffic in 2021 recovered to approximately 40% of 2019 levels even as international markets faced continued reopening challenges. In addition, global economic activity is improving, but continues to be impacted by COVID-19, and governments continue to restrict travel to contain the spread of the virus. While the recovery is accelerating, we continue to expect that it will remain uneven as travel restrictions and varying regional travel protocols impact air travel. 
Further, airline financial performance, which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to IATA, net losses in 2021 for the airline industry are expected to be approximately $52 billion, compared to $138 billion in 2020. Our customers are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in many forms such as deferral of advances and other payments to suppliers, deferrals of deliveries, reduced spending, and in some cases, cancellation of orders. While the outlook is improving and new orders are increasing in 2021, we continue to face a challenging environment in the near to medium-term as airlines have adjusted to reduced air traffic, which in turn, has resulted in lower demand for commercial aerospace products. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.
In The Boeing Company’s (“Boeing”) 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), they indicated that they expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024, and a few years beyond that for the industry to return to the long-term trend growth.
The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the near to medium-term demand, but Boeing’s commercial market outlook forecast projects a four percent growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of two and seven tenths percent average annual gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth, Boeing projects demand for 43,610 new airplanes over the next 20 years. However, the industry remains vulnerable to various developments including fuel price spikes, credit market fluctuations, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics, and increased global environmental regulations. We believe we are well positioned given our product capabilities and our initiatives to increase operating efficiencies to participate in the near term recovery and the long term projected growth rate for commercial air traffic and build rates for large commercial aircraft for the airframe manufacturing industry. If the recovery is slower than anticipated or any of those various developments occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows.
Defense End-Use Market
Our defense end-use market includes products used in military and space, including technologies and structures applications. The defense end-use market is highly cyclical and is impacted by the level of government defense spending. Government defense spending is impacted by national defense policies and priorities, political climates, fiscal budgetary constraints, U.S. Federal budget deficits, projected economic growth and the level of global military or security threats, or other conflicts. Revenues from the military and space end-use market in 2021 represented 70% of our total net revenues during 2021.
The FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”), enacted by the U.S. President in December 2021, is the annual policy bill that establishes, continues, or modifies federal programs, and provides the prerequisites for Congress to appropriate budget authority for defense programs. The FY 2022 NDAA authorized approximately $25 billion more than the U.S. President requested in the FY 2022 budget request. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows. For additional information related to our revenues from customers whose principal sales are to the U.S. Government and our direct sales to the U.S. Government, see “Risk Factors” contained within Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”).
INDUSTRIAL END-USE MARKETS OVERVIEW
Our industrial, medical and other (collectively, “Industrial”) end-use markets are diverse and are impacted by the customers’ needs for increasing electronic content and a desire to outsource. Factors expected to impact these markets include capital and industrial goods spending and general economic conditions. Our products are used in heavy industrial manufacturing systems and certain medical applications. Revenues from the Industrial end-use markets were 6% of our total net revenues during 2021. 
We believe our business in these markets in the long-term, is stable and we are well positioned in these markets even though the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have at least a near term impact on our business.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our commercial revenues are substantially dependent on airframe manufacturers’ production rates of new aircraft. Deliveries of new aircraft by airframe manufacturers are dependent on the demand and financial capacity of its customers, primarily airlines and leasing companies, to purchase the aircraft. Thus, revenues from commercial aircraft could be affected as a result of changes in new aircraft orders, or the cancellation or deferral by airlines of purchases of ordered aircraft. Further, our revenues from commercial aircraft programs could be affected by changes in our customers’ inventory levels and changes in our customers’ aircraft production build rates. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, while both major large aircraft manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus SE (“Airbus”), have announced a ramp up in build rates, it will take longer to reach pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. While the ramp up in production and demand will be slower in the near and medium future, we 
will continue to identify opportunities to expand our presence and offerings with both major large aircraft manufacturers and their supply chain.
Military components manufactured by us are employed in many of the country’s front-line fighters, bombers, rotary-wing aircraft and support aircraft, as well as land and sea-based applications. Our defense business is diversified among a number of military manufacturers and programs. In the space sector, we are expanding our presence with unmanned aerial vehicles and continue to support various satellite programs.
Our sales into the Industrial end-use markets are customer focused in the various markets and driven primarily by their capital spending and manufacturing outsourcing demands.
We continue to broaden and diversify our customer base in the end-use markets we serve by providing innovative product and service solutions by drawing on our core competencies, experience and technical expertise. Net revenues related to military and space, commercial aerospace, and Industrial end-use markets in 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Many of our contracts are firm fixed price contracts subject to termination at the convenience of the customer (as well as for default). In the event of termination for convenience, the customer generally is required to pay the costs we have incurred and certain other fees through the date of termination, plus a reasonable profit. Larger, long-term government subcontracts may have provisions for milestone payments, progress payments or cash advances for purchase of inventory.
Our marketing efforts primarily consist of developing strong, long-term relationships with our customers, which provide the basis for future sales. These close relationships allow us to gain a better insight into each customer’s business needs, identify ways to provide greater value to the customer, and allow us to be designated early in the design process for various products and/or high volume products.
SEASONALITY
The timing of our revenues is governed by the purchasing patterns of our customers, and, as a result, we may not generate revenues equally during the year. However, no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
We currently generate the majority of our revenues from the aerospace and defense industries. As a result, we have significant revenues from certain customers. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (“Raytheon”) were our largest customers, with Boeing generating 8% and Raytheon generating 24% of our 2021 net revenues. Revenues from our top 10 customers, including Boeing and Raytheon were 61% of total net revenues during 2021. Net revenues by major customer for 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Net revenues from our customers, except the U.S. Government, are diversified over a number of different military and space, commercial aerospace, industrial, medical and other products. For additional information on revenues from major customers, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We perform concurrent engineering with our customers and product development activities under our self-funded programs, as well as under contracts with others. Concurrent engineering and product development activities are performed for commercial, military and space applications.
RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS
Raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products include aluminum, titanium, steel and carbon fibers, as well as a wide variety of electronic interconnect and circuit card assemblies and components. These raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers and are generally in adequate supply. However, from time to time, and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced increases in lead times for and limited availability of, aluminum, titanium and certain other raw materials and/or components. Moreover, certain components, supplies and raw materials for our operations are purchased from single source suppliers and occasionally, directed by our customers. In such instances, we strive to develop alternative sources and design modifications to minimize the potential for business interruptions.
COMPETITION
The markets we serve are highly competitive, and our products and services are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete worldwide with domestic and international companies in most markets. These companies may have competitive advantages as a result of greater financial resources, economies of scale and bundled products and services that we do not offer. Additional information related to competition is discussed in Risk Factors contained within Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our ability to compete depends principally upon the breadth of our technical capabilities, the quality of our goods and services, competitive pricing, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, the ability to solve specific customer needs, and customer relationships.
PATENTS AND LICENSES
We have several patents, but we do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. In general, we rely on technical superiority, continual product improvement, exclusive product features, superior lead time, on-time delivery performance, quality, and customer relationships to maintain our competitive advantage.
REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND BACKLOG
We define performance obligations as customer placed purchase orders (“POs”) with firm fixed price and firm delivery dates. The majority of the long-term agreements (“LTAs”) we enter into do not meet the definition of a contract under Accounting Standards Codification 606 (“ASC 606”) and thus, the backlog amount is greater than the remaining performance obligations amount as defined under ASC 606. Revenue based on remaining performance obligations is subject to delivery delays or program cancellations, which are beyond our control. Remaining performance obligations were $814.1 million at December 31, 2021. We anticipate recognizing an estimated 70% or $570.0 million of our remaining performance obligations during 2022.
We define backlog as potential revenue that is based on customer placed POs and LTAs with firm fixed price and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. Backlog is subject to delivery delays or program cancellations, which are beyond our 
control. Backlog is affected by timing differences in the placement of customer orders, and tends to be concentrated in several programs to a greater extent, than our net revenues. Backlog in Industrial markets tends to be of a shorter duration and is generally fulfilled within a three month period. As a result of these factors, trends in our overall level of backlog may not be indicative of trends in our future net revenues. Backlog was $905.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $807.7 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in backlog was primarily in the commercial aerospace end-use market and industrial end-use market. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our business, operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations issued by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge, generation, management, transport and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, pollutants and contaminants. These regulations govern public and private response actions to hazardous or regulated substances that could be or have been released into the environment, or endanger human health, and they require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. We may also be required to investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Additionally, this extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. We anticipate that capital expenditures will continue to be required for the foreseeable future to upgrade and maintain our environmental compliance efforts, however, we do not expect such expenditures to be material in 2022 and the near term.
Structural Systems has been directed by California environmental agencies to investigate and take corrective action for groundwater contamination at its facilities located in Adelanto (a.k.a., El Mirage) and Monrovia, California. Based on currently available information, we have accrued $1.5 million at December 31, 2021 for our estimated liabilities related to these sites. For further information, see Note 14 in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. In addition, see Risk Factors contained within Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for certain risks related to environmental matters.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our employees are critical to our success. We promote a culture of honesty, respect, trust, and teamwork through our Code of Business Conduct. Also, we have been engaged in a number of social matters and issues, both within the Company in our management of human capital, and externally with our community based initiatives.
Employee Safety and Health
The safety of our workforce is our highest priority as evidenced by our initial and continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees and establishing a safe work environment by following the COVID-19 safety recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at all of our facilities.
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion is important to our current and future success. We implemented diversity and inclusion initiatives in 2019 to help accelerate the process of developing a diverse talent pool. To that end, we are seeing an increase in the number of women and individuals from underrepresented communities being promoted into leadership roles. In 2020, we partnered with the Fund II Foundation to utilize its innovative internX platform to provide access to highly qualified and diverse science, technology, engineering and math (“STEM”) students. We believe a diverse hiring process at the intern level will result in inclusive hiring going forward and help us develop a diverse leadership team as our interns continue in their careers.
Talent Acquisition, Retention, and Development
We attract, develop, and retain employee talent by offering competitive compensation packages and fostering a culture of care about their well-being. In addition, we endeavor to be a proactive corporate citizen by being responsive and supportive of the needs of our employees to attract qualified talent. We strive to provide opportunities for qualified members of underrepresented communities and women for advancement within our company and award scholarships to the children and grandchildren of our employees so that they may develop the skills that will support their entry into the workforce. In addition, in 2018, we implemented an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to provide employees the opportunity to share in the ownership of our company and benefit from our performance through the purchase of our company’s stock. The ESPP allows eligible employees to accumulate contributions through after-tax payroll deductions to purchase shares of our company’s stock at a 15% discount and serves as one of the key retention mechanisms for our human capital.
Workforce Demographics
As of December 31, 2021, we had a highly skilled workforce of 2,480 employees, of which 465 are subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring in April 2022 and June 2024. Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without material disruption of operating activities, and believe our relations with our employees are good. See Risk Factors contained within Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees.
