General
Evolution Petroleum Corporation is an oil and gas company focused on delivering a sustainable dividend yield to its shareholders through the ownership, management and development of producing oil and gas properties. The Company's long-term goal is to build a diversified portfolio of oil and gas assets primarily through acquisition, while seeking opportunities to maintain and increase production through selective development, production enhancement and other exploitation efforts on its properties. Our largest active investment is our interest in a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project in Louisiana's Delhi field.
Our operations began in September 2003. In May 2004, our predecessor, Natural Gas Systems, Inc., merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reality Interactive, Inc., an inactive public company, which was renamed Natural Gas Systems, Inc. ("NGS"). In connection with the listing of NGS shares on the American Stock Exchange (currently the NYSE American) in July 2006, NGS was renamed Evolution Petroleum Corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 1155 Dairy Ashford Road, Suite 425, Houston, Texas 77079, and our telephone number is (713) 935-0122. We maintain a website at www.evolutionpetroleum.com, but information contained on our website does not constitute part of this document. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol "EPM".
At June 30, 2018, we had four full-time employees, not including contract personnel and outsourced service providers. None of the Company’s employees are currently represented by a union, and the Company believes that it has excellent relations with its employees. Our team is broadly experienced in oil and gas operations, development, acquisitions and financing. We follow a strategy of outsourcing most of our property accounting, human resources, administrative and other non-core functions. As a result of the retirement of Randy Keys, President and Chief Executive Officer on May 31, 2018, the Board of Directors immediately moved to name Robert Herlin to act as Interim Chief Executive Officer and to commence a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the Board of Directors created a temporary Transition Services Committee, consisting solely of Director William Dozier, to aid and assist management in primarily evaluating potential property acquisitions and operational matters. Both of these appointments are deemed temporary while the ongoing search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer is resolved.
Business Strategy
Evolution Petroleum Corporation is an oil and gas company focused on delivering a sustainable dividend yield to its shareholders through the ownership, management and development of producing oil and gas properties. The Company's long-term goal is to build a diversified portfolio of oil and gas assets primarily through acquisition, while seeking opportunities to maintain and increase production through selective development, production enhancement and other exploitation efforts on its properties. Our largest current asset is our interest in a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project in Louisiana's Delhi field.
Delhi Field - Enhanced Oil Recovery - Onshore Louisiana
Our working and royalty interests in the Delhi Holt-Bryant Unit in the Delhi field (the "Unit"), located in Northeast Louisiana, are currently our sole producing assets. The Unit is approximately 13,636 acres in size and has had a prolific production history totaling approximately 195 million bbls of oil through primary and limited secondary recovery operations since its discovery in the mid-1940s. At the time of our purchase of the field in 2003, the Unit had minimal production. We conveyed our working interest in the field to a subsidiary of Denbury Resources, Inc. in May 2006 for $50 million for the purpose of installing an enhanced oil recovery ("EOR") project in the field. We retained a 23.9% reversionary working interest 
1

upon payout of the project, as defined in the purchase and sale agreements. Since EOR production began in March 2010, the Unit has produced over 17 million bbls of oil.
We own two types of interests in the Unit:

• | 7.2% of overriding royalty interests that are in effect for the life of the Unit and mineral royalty interests, free of all operating and capital cost burdens; and


• | A 23.9% working interest with an associated 19.0% net revenue interest. The working interest reverted to us effective November 1, 2014. Upon the occurrence of this contractual payout, we began bearing 23.9% of all operating expenses and capital expenditures.


• | The above interests are separate and give us a combined net revenue interest of 26.2%.

Our independent reservoir engineers, DeGolyer & MacNaughton, assigned the following estimated reserves net to our interests at Delhi as of June 30, 2018. Equivalent oil reserves are defined as six MCF of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio.

• | 9.4 million bbls of proved oil equivalent reserves, with a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows ("Standardized Measure") of $119 million, and PV-10* of $146 million


• | 4.5 million bbls of probable** oil equivalent reserves


• | 4.6 million bbls of possible** oil equivalent reserves

_______________________________________________________________________________

* | PV-10 of Proved reserves is a non-GAAP measure, reconciled to the Standardized Measure at "Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues" under Item 2. Properties of this Form 10-K. Both the Standardized Measure and PV-10 are based on the average first day of the month net commodity prices received at the Delhi field in the twelve months ending June 30, 2018, which were $57.50 per barrel of oil and $38.97 per barrel of natural gas liquids ("NGL"). Probable and possible reserves are not recognized under GAAP nor is there a comparable GAAP measure for probable and possible reserves.


** | With respect to the above reserve numbers, and references to Probable and Possible reserves throughout this document, estimates of Probable and Possible reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Proved reserves and there must be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the Proved plus Probable reserve estimates. Possible reserves are even less certain and there must be at least a 10% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of Proved, Probable and Possible reserve estimates. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. Estimates of Probable and Possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of Proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk. These three reserve categories have not been adjusted to different levels of recovery risk among these categories and are therefore not comparable and are not meaningfully combined. 

The operator originally planned six primary phases for the installation of the CO2 flood in the Delhi field. Four of these phases have been completed as of June 30, 2017 and two remain undeveloped. One of the remaining two phases (Phase V) is reflected as proved undeveloped in our current reserves report and the other was removed from proved reserves (Phase VI) as it was not deemed economic under current pricing guidelines for SEC purposes.
Phase I began CO2 injection in November 2009. First oil production response occurred in March 2010 and production in the field increased to approximately 1,000 gross barrels of oil per day by December 2010.
Implementation of Phase II, which was more than double the size of Phase I, commenced with incremental CO2 injection at the end of December 2010. First oil production response from Phase II occurred during March 2011, and field gross production increased to more than 4,000 barrels of oil per day by June 2011.
Phase III was installed during calendar 2011, and was expanded twice during calendar 2011. Production subsequently increased to more than 5,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
Phase IV was substantially installed during the first six months of calendar 2012. During early calendar 2013, the operator intensified development in the previously redeveloped western side of the field based on production results and new geological mapping that included the results of seismic data acquired over the last few years. Gross field production increased to more than 7,500 gross barrels of oil per day.

In June 2013, following a fluid release event that consisted of the uncontrolled release of CO2, water, natural gas and a small amount of oil from a previously plugged well in the southwest part of the field, the operator temporarily suspended CO2 injection in most of the southwestern tip of the field. The operator has fully remediated the affected area, but has isolated that part of the field with a water curtain, thus removing that area from the CO2 flood.
This fluid release event, along with other contractual disputes, caused the Company to file suit against the operator in December 2013. In June 2016, we reached a settlement with the operator as described in Note 21 – Delhi Field Litigation Settlement.
Subsequent to the reversion of our working interest to us in November 2014, the operator initiated work on the Phase V expansion of the CO2 flood in the undeveloped eastern part of the field. This project is sometimes referred to as Test Site 5. These operations were suspended shortly after reversion when the operator made significant cuts in its capital budget as a result of declining oil prices. Resumption of this work has been electively delayed due to prevailing oil prices and the partners' allocation of capital to other Delhi projects, primarily the large investment in the NGL plant discussed below. It was further electively delayed based on the conclusion that the economics of the project would be improved if it were implemented after completion of the NGL plant, which has now occurred. We believe that the Phase V expansion of the CO2 flood has favorable economics, particularly in the current oil price environment, and we expect this project to expand the CO2 flood to resume within the next year.
In February 2015, we began construction of an NGL recovery plant in the Delhi Field, which was completed and operational in December 2016. Our net cost for the NGL plant totaled $27 million, which included $0.3 million in September 2017 for capital upgrades to the inlet of recycle plant to bring output capacity up to its expected level.
The NGL plant extracts methane and NGL's from the CO2 recycle stream. The methane and part of the ethane produced by the NGL plant are used to generate electrical power in the field. The extracted NGL's are sold at the field to a purchaser who transports them by truck to a plant for further processing. In addition to the value of these hydrocarbon products, the increased purity of the CO2 stream re-injected into the field should result in operational benefits to the CO2 flood.
In March 2018, the operator began a planned twelve-well infill drilling program in the Delhi field. This program, which has an expected net cost to the Company of approximately $4.7 million, targets productive oil zones in the developed areas of the field that are not being swept effectively by the current CO2 flood. This infill program is expected to both add production and increase ultimate recoveries above the current proved producing oil reserves. Evolution's forecast for the remaining net cost to the Company for this project is approximately $1.9 million. 
In conjunction with the infill drilling program, the operator plans to drill the last two wells of a six-well water injection program on the eastern edge of the planned Phase V expansion of the Delhi field. The Company expects all of these projects to be completed by the end of calendar year 2018. In addition to the planned capital spending discussed above, the Company continues to identify and execute successful capital workover projects to improve conformance and production in the field. These projects are not individually material and are unlikely to have a significant impact on capital spending going forward. The operator has further identified other areas in the Delhi field for potential expansion of the CO2 flood, but the Company has not yet quantified any reserves with respect to such areas.
Artificial Lift Technology (GARP®)
We previously owned artificial lift technology registered as GARP® (Gas Assisted Rod Pump) that was developed internally by our former Senior Vice President of Operations. Its design is intended to increase production and extend the life of horizontal and vertical wells with gas, oil or associated water production with the expectation of recovering additional reserves at an economically attractive cost per BOE. We received a patent on our GARP® technology on August 30, 2011, which provides U.S. patent protection for the technology through early 2028. We have further filed for a continuation in part to our patent for recent improvements in the technology, including a concentric design which allows the technology to work in narrower diameter casing.
Subsequent to receiving our patent, we entered into demonstration joint venture projects and commercialization projects with industry operators between 2012 and early 2015. Most of these projects were successful in establishing or restoring commercial rates of production. However, with the severe decline in oil prices that began in late 2014, a significant portion of these projects were not sufficiently profitable to justify continuation.
As a result of the declining commodity price environment and reduced capital spending by the industry overall, the timing for commercial success of this technology was slower than previously anticipated. Based on a strategic review of these operations, we undertook the separation and transfer of these operations to a new entity controlled by the inventor of the technology and certain former employees of the Company, effective December 31, 2015. We invested $108,750 in common and preferred stock and retained a minority interest in the new entity, Well Lift Inc., together with a 5% royalty on all future gross 
3

revenues derived from the technology. We have the option to convert our preferred stock investment in Well Lift Inc, into a larger, non-controlling equity stake in the new entity. Consequently, we have retained upside for our shareholders from the potential future commercial success of the technology, while eliminating approximately $1.0 million of annual overhead expenses. We have also retained the right to use the technology in our current wells and any future wells we develop or acquire.
Other Projects
Mississippi Lime—Kay County, Oklahoma
In 2012, we acquired a 45% interest in a joint venture with Orion Exploration, a private company based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The joint venture was operated by Orion and engaged in the horizontal development of the Mississippi Lime reservoir in Kay County, Oklahoma. Our leasehold position, totaling approximately 6,600 acres, was located in the eastern, more oil-prone side of the play. We drilled one gross salt water disposal well and reached total depth on two horizontally drilled wells in the Mississippi Lime formation. While both wells produced at the fluid rates expected, the quantities of oil and gas were far less than expected. We subsequently reworked both wells to test the role of structure in production, and determined that this play is a structural play requiring substantial geophysical and geological work and expertise in order to be successful, as opposed to a resource play in which engineering is the primary requirement. Accordingly, we elected in fiscal 2013 to reduce our joint venture interest in undeveloped leases to 33.9%, resulting in a $1.2 million reduction in both our net property and accounts payable. In October 2014, we completed the sale of all of our leasehold interests and wells and any associated assets and abandonment liabilities in the Mississippi Lime reservoir to the operator.
Markets and Customers
We market our production to third parties in a manner consistent with industry practices. In the U.S. market where we operate, crude oil and natural gas liquids are readily transportable and marketable. We do not currently market our share of crude oil production from Delhi separately from the operator's share of production. Although we have the right to take our working interest production in-kind, we are currently selling our oil under the Delhi operator's agreement with Plains Marketing L.P. pursuant to the delivery and pricing terms thereunder. The oil from Delhi is currently transported from the field by pipeline, which results in better net pricing than the alternative of transportation by truck. Delhi crude oil production sells at Louisiana Light Sweet ("LLS") pricing which generally trades at a premium to West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil pricing. The positive LLS Gulf Coast average price differential over WTI, as quoted daily on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), was approximately $3.82 per barrel during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The differential has increased from the prior year and we expect that a positive LLS price differential will continue, at least in the near future. Our overall average net oil price, including the LLS premium and after all adjustments for transportation, marketing and other price differentials, was $0.30 per barrel more than the average WTI NYMEX price for fiscal 2018.
Upon completion of the NGL plant in late 2016, we began selling natural gas liquids from the Delhi field to American Midstream Gas Solutions, L.P. Title to these products is transferred to the purchaser at the field and they are transported by truck to the purchaser's processing facility. We receive market prices, less transportation, processing and quality differential fees for the net yield of the individual natural gas liquid components, consisting of propane, butanes, and C5+ (pentanes and heavier components). There is a small component of residual ethane, but the overall yield of products is a higher value mix than is typical for natural gas liquids.
The following table sets forth purchasers of our oil and natural gas production for the years indicated:

 | Year Ended June 30,
Customer | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Plains Marketing L.P. (Oil sales from Delhi) | 92 | % | | 97 | % | 99 | %
American Midstream Gas Solutions (NGL sales from Delhi) | 8 | % | | 3 | % | — | %
All others | — | % | | — | % | 1 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

The loss of our purchaser at the Delhi field or disruption to pipeline transportation from the field could adversely affect our net realized pricing and potentially our near-term production levels. The loss of any of our other purchasers would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Market Conditions
Marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids and the prices we receive are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, the exact effect of which is difficult to predict. These factors include changes in supply and demand, market prices, government regulation and actions of major foreign producers.

Over the past 30 years, crude oil price fluctuations have been extremely volatile, with crude oil prices varying from less than $10 to over $140 per barrel. More recently, the price of oil per barrel dropped dramatically, starting in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2017 before recovering somewhat in 2018. Worldwide factors such as geopolitical, macroeconomic, supply and demand, refining capacity, petrochemical production and derivatives trading, among others, influence prices for crude oil. Local factors also influence prices for crude oil and include increasing or decreasing production trends, quality differences, regulation and transportation issues unique to certain producing regions and reservoirs.
Also over the past 30 years, domestic natural gas prices have been extremely volatile, ranging from $1 to $15 per MMBTU. The spot market for natural gas, changes in supply and demand, derivatives trading, pipeline availability, BTU content of the natural gas and weather patterns, among others, cause natural gas prices to be subject to significant fluctuations. Due to the practical difficulties in transporting natural gas, local and regional factors tend to influence product prices more for natural gas than for crude oil.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive for prospects, acreage and capital. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours. Competitors are national, regional or local in scope and compete on the basis of financial resources, technical prowess or local knowledge. The principal competitive factors in our industry are expertise in given geographical and geological areas and the abilities to efficiently conduct operations, achieve technological advantages, identify, acquire economically producible reserves and obtain capital at rates which allow economic investments.
Seasonality
For a discussion of seasonal changes that affect our business, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other Economic Factors - Seasonality in this Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry. These laws and regulations are often changed in response to changes in the political or economic environment. Compliance with this evolving regulatory burden is often difficult and costly, and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations and we believe that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us. The future annual capital cost of complying with the regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements which are unpredictable. However, we do not currently anticipate that future compliance with existing laws and regulations will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
See "Government regulation and liability for environmental matters that may adversely affect our business and results of operations" under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding government regulation.
Insurance
We maintain insurance on our operated and non-operated properties and operations for risks and in amounts customary in the industry. Such insurance includes general liability, excess liability, control of well, operators extra expense, casualty, fraud and directors & officer's liability coverage. Not all losses are insured, and we retain certain risks of loss through deductibles, limits and self-retentions. We do not carry lost profits coverage and we do not have coverage for consequential damages.
Additional Information
We file Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") . Our reports filed with the SEC are available free of charge to the general public through our website at www.evolutionpetroleum.com.
