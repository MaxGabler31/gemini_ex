Item 1. Business
General

Insignia Systems, Inc. (“Insignia,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company”) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1990. We are a leading provider of in-store advertising solutions to brands, retailers, shopper marketing agencies and brokerages (“clients”). We believe our products and services are attractive to our clients because of our ability to navigate the complex retail landscape, to customize our solutions down to store level, to execute with excellence and the results our solutions deliver. Our leadership and employees have extensive industry knowledge, including direct experience through former positions at consumer-packaged goods (“CPG”) manufacturers and retailers. We provide marketing solutions to brands spanning from some of the largest multinationals to new and emerging brands. 

For retailers and brands working in an environment that is tighter, more competitive, and more complex every day, Insignia positions itself as the shopper marketing ally that combines best-in-class execution with imagination, responsiveness, and hunger to help move business forward. We take the relationships we have with our clients and vendor partnerships very seriously by having our team stretch the extra mile to ensure flawless execution. We sincerely approach our projects with the same passion as our clients do. These relationships are built with our brand-led, retailer centric mindset, our ability to be nimble and flexible to the ever-changing industry landscape and our delivery of superior customer service that our clients deserve. Our in-store solutions are executed in retailers spanning from some of the largest national retailers to regional US wholesalers and independents who are leaders in their respective channels and geographies. 

Up until 2020, our primary solution had been in-store signage, specifically Point-Of-Purchase Services (POPS®). The Insignia POPS solution is a national, account-specific, shelf-edge advertising and promotion tactic. Primarily as a result of competitive pressures and most recently due to COVID-19, our in-store signage business has declined and become less of a focus in our growth. Beginning in 2018 we began developing and offering an expanded portfolio of solutions including on-pack, merchandising and digital solutions in addition to our core business. Our expanded portfolio allows us to meet the needs of brands, retailers and their agents as their business strategies evolve behind an ever-changing retail landscape. Over the course of 2021 based on client feedback, business results and expanded team capabilities our primary focus is now on in-store solutions, resulting in our decision to exit digital solutions in addition to right-sizing our in-store signage portfolio. With our diversification of business, we recognized over 75% of our revenue from these recently developed solutions in 2021. 

In the last half of 2020 we outsourced most of our printing and IT operations. In 2021 we relocated our headquarters and operations, both to smaller, more efficient leased spaces. These changes have allowed us to not only significantly reduce lease expense but also adapt to a hybrid work environment due to COVID-19 and move closer in proximity to multiple clients and vendor partners. The new office spaces also enhance our ability to recruit top talent based on the overall proximity and appeal of our locations.

Industry and Market Background

Our industry continues to rapidly evolve in several ways: 


1. | Shopper Behavior: Even prior to the start of the pandemic, shopper behavior was evolving. The rise of surrogate shopper services, drive-up pick-up services or pick-up in store have put the shopper in the driver seat to shop when, where and how they want. Retailers are competing on convenience more than ever and brands are increasingly fighting to stand out from their competition.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Brand Fragmentation: Consumer loyalty is shifting from established to emerging brands, who often are launching in retail for the first time and are looking for solutions to help them be discovered. 
3. | Financial Justification: Brands remain diligently focused on top and bottom-line financial metrics, which drives increased pressure to deliver not only breakthrough design and creativity but also at a competitive price that delivers the return on their investment. 
4. | Supply Chain Disruptions and Commodity Price Increases: Primarily because of COVID-19 our clients and vendor partners have experienced longer than normal lead-times on shipping and fulfillment as well as overall cost increases on raw materials for inputs. We expect these trends to continue in 2022. 


Despite continued rapid growth in e-commerce, both retailers and brands are actively seeking to grow their brands in physical stores. We continue to execute programs for brands who started as direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands and are launching in physical stores, as well as brands launching for the first time. On the retail side, many of the top US retailers have recently renovated their stores to deliver a multi-service approach, whether their shoppers are coming in-store to shop traditionally, picking up in-store or waiting in the parking lot for their order. Driving traffic to stores and giving shoppers a reason to come into their stores and shop are extremely important. Retailers are seeking companies with our capabilities and experience to help build in-store solutions that inspire, educate and ultimately convert active shoppers while they are shopping. Retailers are continuing to seek ways to connect their online strategies with their in-store strategies to build shopper loyalty and to develop solutions to enhance the shopper’s in-store experience. Brands are increasingly looking for opportunities to reinforce their brand equity as close as possible to the point of purchase or to expand the number of locations where they are offered in store to ensure they are selected over competition. We believe emerging brands are looking for ways to get discovered and tell shoppers their story. These trends along with new developments in shopper analytics are opening opportunities for innovative companies to develop new products and new ways of helping retailers and brands connect with shoppers. 

Product Solutions

Since the Company’s inception in 1990, we have worked closely with our clients to understand their evolving needs and introduce solutions that help them achieve their business strategies. Historically, our core product has been in-store signage solutions, namely the Insignia Point-of Purchase Services (POPS®). Over the past several years, our net sales from sign solutions have declined primarily due to competitive pressures while our non-POPS solutions have significantly expanded as we have developed our portfolio to meet the needs of our clients and execution partners more holistically. For example, our in-store signage solutions represented approximately 25% of our total net sales for 2021, compared to 44% of our total net sales in 2020.

1. | Our Merchandising Solutions are designed to help brands get discovered, build awareness and drive impulse purchases via a secondary or often permanent placement of their products. Our merchandising solutions include a variety of fully customized temporary, semi-permanent and permanent displays, that brands leverage to grow their sales. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Our On-Pack Solutions appear on the individual product package and are designed to drive awareness, impulse purchases, and capture market share within a very short period. On-pack solutions include BoxTalkTM, coupons, recipes, and cross-promotions. 
3. | Our In-Store Signage Solutions, which include POPS signs, help brands achieve a variety of objectives that include awareness and sales lift. The in-store signage solutions are placed perpendicular to the shelf and are designed to attract the attention of the shopper even before they arrive in front of the shelf to consider the purchase of a product.

Marketing and Sales

Our highly skilled direct sales and marketing teams are a major asset for the organization with their deep knowledge of brands and retailers. 

Our sales team is focused on:


· | Building and sustaining client relationships; 
--+---------------------------------------------------
· | Increasing overall sales pipeline and revenue; and
· | Continued retail and brand expertise. 


Our marketing team is focused on the following:


· | Increasing awareness of our corporate brand; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
· | Analyzing the effectiveness of executed offerings; and 
· | Developing and commercializing new and existing solutions.


Our in-store signage solutions are available for sale into a network of retailers that is managed and maintained through direct relationships or can be sold to certain retailers in the Mass Merchant and Grocery Channel. 

During each of the last two most recently completed fiscal years, foreign sales accounted for less than 1% of total net sales each year. We expect sales to foreign distributors will remain less than 1% of total net sales in 2022.

Competition

As we have diversified our portfolio, our competition has as well. Historically on our in-store signage business, we had one main competitor, News America (which has been sold to Neptune Retail Solutions). We observed increased competition in growing and maintaining our network of retailers into which we are authorized to sell solutions as a result of our competitor continuing to purchase new exclusive arrangements or extend existing exclusive arrangements with retailers for that purpose. We are currently party to legal proceedings involving News Corporation, News America Marketing FSI L.L.C., and News America Marketing In-Store Services L.L.C. (collectively, “News America”). In short, the Company alleges that News America has monopolized the national market for third-party in-store advertising and promotion products and services through various wrongful acts designed to harm the Company, its last significant competitor. The lawsuit is described further in Item 3 of Part I of this report. With our expanded merchandising and on-pack solutions, the competitive landscape is much more diverse and broad and our results vary based on what the client’s priority is whether that is price, design or execution. 

We believe our primary competitive strengths include:


· | Best-in-class execution across our portfolio of product solutions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Broad client-base of brands inclusive of large Fortune 500 companies, and emerging start-ups;
· | Managing and providing turn-key access to a national network of retailers; 
· | Imagination, responsiveness, and hunger to help move our clients’ business forward; and 
· | Our extensive broad retail and brand expertise.

Service and Solution Development

New services, solutions and enhancements to existing offerings are developed either internally or externally and may include proprietary data management, operations systems, and design guidance. Over the past several years, we have significantly expanded our offered solutions and have developed a portfolio designed to meet the needs of our clients and execution partners more holistically.
Business Plan 

Our strategic plan, seeks to differentiate Insignia from our competition, situate Insignia for growth within our industry and better protect Insignia from competitive response through our overall portfolio diversification. The strategic plan consists of:

1. | Accelerate Display. Double down on our display capabilities and offerings. Strategically expand overall market outreach aligned with our capabilities and knowledge. Enhance internal capabilities for added client benefit. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Grow On-Pack. Increase overall product offerings via innovation. Broaden overall market reach with strategic partners and clients. 
3. | Streamline Signage. Optimize sales with targeted outreach and strategic clients. Continue to streamline overall day-to-day operations with outsourced manufacturing partners and execution process. Collaborate with retail partners with an optimized investment approach.
4. | Invest in our Future. Continue to recruit and retain top talent. Thoughtfully invest in strategic resources that result in employee development, customer satisfaction and increased revenues. 


Our strategic plan acknowledges the challenges and opportunities we face within our industry and given the rapid change in retail in the current environment, we continue to be faced with risk of short-to-intermediate term volatility in our operating and financial performance.

Environmental Matters

We believe our operations follow all applicable environmental regulations within the jurisdictions in which we operate. The costs and effects of compliance with these regulations have not been and are not expected to become material.
Human Capital Resources and Management

We had 32 employees, of which 31 were full-time employees, as of March 8, 2022. We believe relationships are our focus and our future, and that begins with our own team. We believe in creating an environment where our employees have opportunities to grow and develop professionally. We also strive to create a work environment that employees are proud to be a part of. 

· | Employee Engagement. We believe in regular engagement with our full team, whether that is starting off our week together in our Monday Huddle meetings, celebrating nominated employees for quarterly recognition or enjoying events our Employee Engagement committee plans. We also take employees’ feedback and concerns to heart and leverage this to help enhance our employee experience. Ultimately, this promotes retention and the overall success of our organization. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Talent Development. We have all our employees participate in annual development plans where we focus on both employee strengths and opportunities. In 2021, 15% of our employees advanced their careers with earned promotions based on their development and performance. Based on our employees’ needs, we can provide them a wide range of both formal and informal development opportunities. As an example, in 2021, we invested in new software for our design and creative team to further enhance our capabilities and output to our clients. 
· | Focus on Safety. The safety of our employees is a priority. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, that included giving many of our employees the flexibility to work from home. 
· | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We recognize that our best performance comes when we have a team built off of diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2021, we reemphasized our focus when we were recognized by Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership for diversity in both our boardroom and executive leadership teams. In addition, we selected Strive Publishing, a local publisher whose mission is to inspire community collaboration in publishing stories to heal, teach, learn, and earn while building an ecosystem that embodies a rich Black culture and heritage for a donation around Juneteenth.
· | Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, these programs, can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, and on-site services.
