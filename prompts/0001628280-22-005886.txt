Company Overview
Our mission is to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly.
Aurora was founded in 2017 by Chris Urmson, Sterling Anderson, and Drew Bagnell, three of the most prominent leaders in the self-driving space. Led by a team with deep experience, we are developing the Aurora Driver based on what we believe to be the most advanced and scalable suite of self-driving hardware, software, and data services in the world to fundamentally transform the global transportation market. The Aurora Driver is designed as a platform to adapt and interoperate amongst a multitude of vehicle types and applications. As of December 31, 2021, it has been successfully integrated into eight different vehicle platforms designed to meet its requirements: from passenger vehicles to light commercial vehicles to Class 8 trucks. By creating a common driver platform for multiple vehicle types and use cases, the capabilities we develop in one market reinforce and strengthen our competitive advantages in other areas. For example, the capabilities needed for a truck to move safely at highway speeds would also be critical in ride hailing when driving a passenger to the airport via a highway. We believe this is the right approach to bring self-driving to market and will enable us to capitalize on a massive opportunity, including the $4 trillion global trucking market, the $5 trillion passenger mobility market, and the $400 billion local goods delivery market.
Beyond the economic opportunity, we believe we have a unique opportunity to affect a material positive impact on the lives of millions of people, while also improving business productivity. First and foremost, we are focused on the opportunity to greatly improve road safety. Every year more than a million people lose their lives on the world’s roads, and we believe we can meaningfully reduce this number. In trucking, we can enable logistics networks to move goods more efficiently, and also help fill the shortage of 80,000 truck drivers as of 2021 by providing a self-driving option. We will expand access to transportation, improving the lives of approximately 25.5 million people with a disability in the U.S. who have difficulty traveling outside of the home. And we will give people back their time; the average driver spends the equivalent of 10 days a year commuting—time that can be made more productive and enjoyable.
We intend to launch trucking as our first driverless product, as we believe its massive scale, significant structural need, attractive unit economics, and self-similar operating environment will allow us to rapidly deploy and profitably scale on high-volume, highway-focused routes. Drafting on the revenue and technical capability we expect this trucking product to generate, we plan to leverage the extensibility of the Aurora Driver to deploy and scale into the passenger mobility and local goods delivery markets. Today, we operate our self-driving test vehicle fleet in diverse weather and operating environments, across the Bay Area, Pittsburgh and Texas, allowing us to create a more robust self-driving system. We also carry truck freight on behalf of our partners in preparation for driverless commercialization.
Our first-principles approach, which we define as “Self-Driving 2.0,” underpins our technology development strategy for the Aurora Driver. We made foundational investments early on, based on our prior experience in the self-driving industry, that allow us to accelerate development and position our platform for long-term scalability. Some of these foundational investments include developing the Aurora Driver with what we believe to be the optimal combination of machine-learned and rule-based approaches. We have also built a proprietary Virtual Testing Suite, which makes our development more efficient and faster than traditional approaches that rely heavily on on-road vehicle fleets. While many companies in the self-driving industry tout miles driven as a metric, our Virtual Testing Suite allows us to iterate faster and more efficiently, while reducing our reliance on on-road testing.
We have also invested in our next-generation sensing suite, which combines the best of camera, radar, and lidar. This includes developing our Aurora FirstLight Lidar, which uses proprietary frequency modulated continuous wave (“FMCW”) technology that enables long-range sensing, and simultaneous detection of both the position and velocity of objects. We believe that when combined with our industry-leading sensor suite and perception system, this technology uniquely enables safe operation at highway speeds and is unmatched by our competitors’ alternative solutions. We believe this unlocks the $4 trillion global trucking market, as trucks must be capable of operating at up to 65 miles per hour and 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, necessitating redundant long-range sensing in order to plan and take action appropriately. High-speed operation is also key to unlocking the full opportunity set across passenger mobility and local goods delivery, where a significant percentage of trips require operation on highways and other high-speed roads.
To bring our product to market at scale, we focus on what we do best – building self-driving technology – and through strategic partnerships work with best-in-class companies to deliver the benefits of our technology broadly. We have strategic partnerships with:
•PACCAR & Volvo, who together represent nearly 50% of US Class 8 truck sales.
•Toyota, the #1 passenger vehicle manufacturer by volume globally.
•Uber, the largest ride hailing company globally.
With these strategic partnerships, each party is making significant investments towards integrating the Aurora Driver into their vehicles and logistics and mobility networks. We believe that partnering with other industry leaders enables us to scale more efficiently, as it allows us to focus on what we do best – developing the Aurora Driver—while our partners handle activities such as vehicle manufacturing, fleet ownership, and operation. We are proud that these industry leaders have selected Aurora as their self-driving partner. During 2021, we launched commercial trucking pilots with Fedex and Uber Freight in which we began regularly and autonomously hauling loads under the supervision of vehicle operators, and also exploring integrating access to Uber Freight’s digital freight network within our autonomous trucking product. 
To deliver our product, we plan to offer a Driver as a Service business model, whereby partners can subscribe on a per mile basis. While we will supply self-driving technology, we do not intend to own nor operate large vehicle fleets ourselves. We will partner with automotive companies, fleet operators, and other third parties to commercialize and support Aurora-powered vehicles. We expect this Driver as a Service model to enable an asset-light and high-margin revenue stream for Aurora, while allowing us to scale more rapidly through partnerships.
As of December 31, 2021, we have assembled an approximately 1,600-person team, consisting of leading experts in robotics, machine learning, hardware design, software engineering, systems engineering, and safety. We believe that our combined experience and expertise allow us to move faster and more efficiently than our competitors as we make purposeful, foundational technological investments in safe and scalable self-driving technology.
The Self-Driving Industry
The concept of self-driving vehicles has captured the human imagination for nearly a century. Early demonstrations, led by academics and industry experts, have shown both the promise of this technology as well as the difficulty of its development. These scattered efforts were jump started in the early 2000s when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored a series of open competitions to focus and accelerate the efforts of various research groups. Our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Urmson was the technical director for the Carnegie Mellon University team that progressed furthest in the first DARPA competition in 2004 and won the final, 60-mile long urban driving challenge in 2007.
Since that time, major automotive and technology companies, as well as promising startups, have invested heavily in this technology. As a result, the industry has experienced rapid improvement in a multitude of areas including sensor range and accuracy, computing and processing capacity, machine learning techniques, vehicle integration, and safety redundancy.
Levels of Automation
To measure the scope of these systems, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six levels of automation, from no automation (Level 0) to full automation (Level 5). Advanced driver assistance (ADAS) technologies, which are reliant on human oversight and intervention, are classified as Level 1 and Level 2 automation.
Aurora’s technology is designed to deliver fully autonomous driving without the need for human intervention. This is classified as Level 4 – High Automation, with the vehicle capable of performing all driving functions under certain conditions, such as specific road types and weather. This set of conditions is referred to as the system’s “operating domain.” We believe that, because a driver is no longer required inside the vehicle, this level of automation allows for step-change benefits in both safety and efficiency and opens massive commercial opportunities.
Benefits of Automation
Key benefits of vehicle automation include:
•Improved safety. Each year 1.3 million people lose their lives in vehicle accidents globally. In the United States, truck transportation is the industry occupation with the highest number of fatalities. Human factors, such as fatigue, distraction, or recklessness, are estimated to contribute to up to 94% of crashes. Autonomous cars and trucks can mitigate these factors through constant and consistent attention to the driving environment and advanced sensing and perception technology.
•Faster, more efficient goods movement. E-commerce continues to grow share of consumer purchases, and expectations for rapid, or same-day delivery are constantly increasing. Today, truck drivers are limited to eleven hours per day of driving based on Hours of Service limitations. Autonomous trucks will not be subject to these limitations, and we expect our trucks will be able to move freight more than twenty hours per day, thereby moving goods faster and more efficiently. For example, this means a truckload of goods can be shipped from Los Angeles to Houston in one day, instead of two. We believe this will enable smoother and more reliable supply chains and expand markets for manufacturers and retailers.
•More reliable freight supply. The trucking industry currently faces an estimated 80,000 driver shortage, which is forecast to rise to 160,000 by 2028. Fewer drivers are entering the trucking industry, and 54% of truckers were older than 45 years old in 2020, compared to 31% in 1994. These factors drive the over 90% annualized turnover at large truckload carriers. Labor related costs are also the leading cost component for trucking, representing 44% of per-mile trucking costs. We believe autonomous trucks can address the driver shortage and meaningfully reduce costs.
•Reduced Insurance Expenses. The average cost of a large truck crash involving a fatality is $3.6 million. Insurance costs rose 5% per year from 2010 to 2018, and the cost of insurance is consistently ranked as a top concern by truck carriers. As we drive safety improvements for autonomous vehicles, we also enable meaningful cost savings.
•Enhanced Energy Efficiency. Transportation represents 29% of total US greenhouse emissions, of which 82% comes from light-duty vehicles and medium and heavy-duty trucks. Several studies have shown that autonomous trucks have the potential to materially reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in excess of 10% through eco-driving, off-peak deployment, and capping peak speeds.
We also believe self-driving technology will accelerate the transition to next-generation power trains such as battery electric and hydrogen fuel cells, as we believe geofenced operations are more conducive to deploying new infrastructure, and cost savings, enabled by lower maintenance and fuel spend, are attractive drivers of fleet adoption.
•Increased access to passenger mobility. Autonomous vehicles enable greater access to transportation by reducing the costs of transportation and providing a viable alternative to manually driven vehicles. For example, according to the BTS Transportation Statistics Annual Report, more than 56 million Americans report having a disability, and an estimated 25.5 million people report having disabilities that make traveling outside the home difficult. Even further, an estimated 3.6 million people with disabilities report not leaving their homes because they are disabled or housebound.
•Greater individual productivity. According to a study from Securing America’s Future (SAFE), in the United States, nearly 7 billion hours are spent in traffic each year. We believe that self-driving technology will enable significant productivity gains for individuals who will gain the freedom to allocate time spent driving to other activities.
Commercialization & Growth Strategy
We plan to commercialize the Aurora Driver safely, quickly, and broadly. Key tenets of our commercialization and growth approach are:
1.Prioritizing our development efforts based on return on investment. The Aurora Driver will eventually be able to serve different applications and use cases over broad areas. At the same time, our goal is to drive value quickly for our partners and society, as well as scale our business. This leads us to trucking as our first commercial product, given massive industry demand, attractive unit economics, ability to deploy on high volume highway-focused routes, and self-similarity in the interstate highway system. Similarly, as we extend capabilities and geographic reach in trucking and later rides, we will focus on the highest returning areas first, and extend outwards from there.
2.Using our common platform approach to scale and drive competitive advantage. Because the Aurora Driver works across vehicle platforms and applications, we inherit the capabilities previously developed as we extend into new areas. This allows us to earn a higher return on our development investment, and drive scale across use cases, which in turn increases our pace of learning and helps reduce the cost of our hardware.
3.Focusing on what we do best. Our core business is developing the safest and best self-driving system in the world. Our Driver as a Service business model recognizes the immense capabilities and strengths of our OEM, network and logistics partners and allows each party to focus on what they do best as we commercialize and scale our technology.
4.Building on our trusted reputation. The opportunity to revolutionize transportation is massive, but this opportunity depends on trust. Our technology needs to be trustworthy. Our company needs to be trustworthy. And so our task is to build trust, one step at a time. We do so by engaging with different stakeholder groups – local, state and federal governments, partners, and the general public. We believe that the credibility and trust we continue to build will serve us well as we deliver this technology.
Vehicles drove over 3.2 trillion miles in the United States in 2019. This represents a massive potential market opportunity for self-driving technology. We estimate that our core markets of trucking, passenger mobility, and local goods delivery currently generate $2 trillion of revenue in the United States, and over $9 trillion globally. As a fully integrated L4 autonomous driving system, we believe the Aurora Driver will be uniquely positioned to capture market share and play a critical role in the evolving autonomous vehicle ecosystem. 
Trucking
We plan to launch Aurora Horizon, our driverless trucking subscription service, as our first commercial product. We have prioritized this segment as we believe it is an optimal first product for both commercial and technical reasons:
•Commercial. Trucking generated over $700 billion in revenue and 300 billion vehicle miles traveled in the US in 2019. Trucking is a critical part of the United States economy, responsible for moving 65% of goods. Globally, we estimate that trucking is a $4 trillion industry. The trucking industry faces a number of ongoing challenges that the Aurora Driver can help solve. The industry has experienced a persistent driver shortage, resulting in high driver turnover. Growth in e-commerce increases customer expectations for same- or next-day delivery, while service restrictions on driver operating hours create inherent limitations to optimally fast and responsive supply chains. These constraints increase the cost to transport goods and create supply chain inefficiencies. By enabling greater efficiency, autonomous trucks can have a significant positive impact. For these reasons, the US Department of Transportation has recently stated that autonomous trucking has the potential to add over $68 billion to US GDP. We believe our technology can help solve key pain points of fleet owners by providing a consistent driver supply, the ability to offer fast and efficient transport, and fuel efficiency. In turn, we believe this creates significant demand and willingness to pay for our product. Additionally, the design and road construction of highways is more standardized and defined across the United States interstate highway system than are local roads, and a very significant amount of freight volume is concentrated on major highway corridors. We believe these factors will enable rapid and broad scaling. 
•Technical. The United States interstate highway system is a more structured environment than urban streets given limited access to pedestrians, bicyclists, and crossing intersections. Moreover, moving goods avoids the complexity of solving for passenger ride comfort, as the system can be optimized to drive cautiously and, for instance, pull over on the highway shoulder safely if the system encounters something that it has not learned to handle autonomously. One element of highway autonomous trucking that must be considered is the increased requirements on the system’s perception capabilities, particularly as it relates to seeing at far range, given that the vehicle may weigh up to 80,000 pounds and operate at up to 65 miles per hour. Aurora’s investment in long-range perception, including Aurora’s proprietary FirstLight Lidar, enables us to solve this, while benefiting from the other elements that make deploying trucks on highways an advantageous initial market entry point.
During 2021, we launched commercial trucking pilots with Fedex and Uber Freight in which we began regularly and autonomously hauling loads under the supervision of vehicle operators, and also exploring integrating access to Uber Freight’s digital freight network within our autonomous trucking product. 
We plan to initially launch Aurora Horizon, our driverless trucking product, in late 2023 in Texas, which has the largest freight market in the US, a favorable business and regulatory environment, and moderate weather. These characteristics make it an attractive market for our initial driverless launch. From there, we plan to expand to other key freight corridors, which we will prioritize based on commercial, technical, and regulatory considerations. We expect to expand nationwide over the course of the decade. 
Passenger Mobility
Our second core market focuses on passenger mobility, initially targeting the ride hailing space with Aurora Connect, our driverless ride hailing subscription service. Based on public filings, we estimate that the U.S. ride-hailing market was a $35 billion market in 2019, growing at more than 10% annually. Beyond ride-hailing, the broader passenger mobility market includes nearly 2 trillion vehicle miles driven by personally owned light-duty vehicles in urbanized areas. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the U.S. passenger mobility market is in excess of $1 trillion. Alongside health, housing, and food, transportation is one of the largest segments of U.S. household spending. Globally, we estimate that passenger mobility represents a $5 trillion market.
As it exists today, however, passenger mobility is subject to inefficiencies and responsible for notable negative impacts – roadway deaths, lost productivity, and greenhouse gas emissions. These are all challenges that self-driving technology has the potential to help alleviate. We believe that the Aurora Driver can provide a safer alternative to manually-driven transport, return numerous hours that would otherwise have been spent driving, and expedite the transition to electric vehicles.
We believe technological advancements in ride-hailing and lower structural costs, enabled by self-driving technology, will expand ride-hailing into more passenger mobility use cases and drive mass adoption, further democratizing access to mobility. We aim to improve the rider experience through the quality, cleanliness, and consistency of the Aurora Driver-powered fleet while also offering more rider control over the in-vehicle experience (e.g. music, climate). Future vehicle platforms may be designed to support specific transportation use cases (e.g. airport trips, commutes, social rides) that further improve the experience offered today.
We plan to launch Aurora Connect, our driverless ride hailing product, in late 2024, leveraging our strategic relationships with Toyota and Uber. As we use the same Aurora Driver hardware and software as for trucking, we will leverage capabilities already in use by our trucking product. Our ability to drive safely at high speed will allow us to serve the significant fraction of ride-hailing trips that require high speed on interstates and highways. We expect our growth will consist of commercial expansion within and across cities.
Local Goods Delivery
Our third core market is local goods delivery, which we estimate to be a $100 billion market in the United States and $400 billion globally, growing at more than 10% annually, based on public filings and industry reports. This market spans several sub-segments, including last-mile parcel and post, prepared food, grocery, and business-to-business (B2B) delivery.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of local goods delivery, as well as the supply chain disruptions that can be experienced when consumer behavior changes abruptly. We expect consumer demand for online shopping and on-demand ordering will largely remain in place following the COVID-19 pandemic and that retailers, restaurants, and other local businesses will seek to address these preferences through expanded delivery channels. Self-driving technology can provide meaningful value in making e-commerce and on-demand purchases more affordable for consumers and more accessible to businesses.
Relative to trucking and passenger mobility, we believe local goods delivery has more advanced technical complexity given active problem-solving related to identifying appropriate drop-off locations and completion of the “last 50 feet” of goods delivery from vehicle to door. We expect that the Aurora Driver will be uniquely positioned to serve this market based on reinforcing competitive advantages and technical gains from trucking and ride hailing. We expect the operating domain for local goods delivery to overlap closely with personal mobility and commercial operations of local goods delivery to commence following personal mobility launch.
Expand global footprint.
We intend for the Aurora Driver to serve people and communities around the world. Our commercial operations will start in the United States, but we expect to broaden our footprint to include international markets where the value proposition of our technology is compelling, regulations are conducive, and roadways are comparable. This includes, but is not limited to, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia and New Zealand.
Self-reinforcing effects of our business model
We believe that our operation across these three large markets leads to multiple beneficial self-reinforcing effects for our business model:
1.Higher return on development investment. By being able to recoup the significant majority of our development costs across multiple end markets, we increase the return on our overall investment, as well as each capability we develop.
2.Economies of scale and cost reduction. The scale we generate in one market will serve to drive down our hardware cost. Because we use the same hardware stack across vehicle types, this reduces our cost to serve each end-market in which we operate.
3.Learning and data. By having an ever-increasing Aurora-Driver powered vehicle fleet, we collect more data and driving experience to hone our system; the benefit accrues across all markets in which we operate.
4.Reputation. Trust in our company and technology is paramount, and we expect that the trust we earn – with governments, the public, and partners – builds across the markets in which we operate.
Aurora’s Competitive Advantages
Industry leading team.
Aurora was founded in 2017 by Chris Urmson, Sterling Anderson, and Drew Bagnell, three leaders in the self-driving space. Chris led the Google self-driving car team and was technology director for Carnegie Mellon when it won the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge; Sterling developed MIT’s Intelligent CoPilot, then launched Tesla’s Model X and Autopilot; Drew worked for two decades at the intersection of machine learning and robotics across industry and academia at Carnegie Mellon. As of December 31, 2021, Aurora has assembled an approximately 1,600-person team, of whom approximately 1,400 focus on engineering and product. Our company consists of world-leaders in robotics, machine learning, hardware design, software engineering, systems engineering, and safety. Aurora has over 1,100 awarded and 
pending patents worldwide. In 2021, Aurora acquired and integrated Uber’s self-driving unit, strengthening our team, our technology, and our intellectual property. The acquisition added to the breadth and depth of talent we have to deliver on our mission. We foster a high-performance and mission-driven culture which drives successful execution, and we believe this makes us an employer of choice in our industry.
Next-generation technology
Unencumbered by legacy technology and methods, we have taken a clean sheet approach to creating a safe and scalable self-driving system. We have invested in key areas of differentiation that we believe provide a long-term advantage, including:
•Careful integration of machine learning and engineering approaches throughout our perception and motion planning systems
•Virtual Testing Suite that allows for accelerated and efficient development
•Differentiated long-range, high-resolution, multi-modal sensor suite that includes FirstLight Lidar technology, which allows numerous advantages over traditional lidar, including the ability to unlock safe operation at highway speeds
•Scalable maps that are maximally relevant to the challenges of self-driving
Common driver platform technology, scalable across vehicle types and use cases
The Aurora Driver is built on a common architecture that is designed to adapt readily to the vehicle platform it controls. This allows the Aurora Driver to learn from and leverage its experience and capabilities across a wide range of vehicle makes and models. We invested early in our hardware suite to minimize reliance on any one vehicle platform, allowing greater optionality in both the types of vehicles we use as well as their commercial applications.
Differentiated go-to-market strategy
Our technology enables us to first target trucking, which we believe is the optimal way to enter the market and scale self-driving technology. Because of the extensibility of the Aurora Driver across vehicle types and use cases, we are able to take advantage of capability overlap across use cases, increased learning with scale, and cost reductions in our self-driving system. Therefore, the capabilities and scale we develop in trucking accelerate our expansion into passenger mobility and local goods delivery, and vice versa.
Deep strategic partnerships which support commercialization at scale
We have developed strategic partnerships with industry leaders like PACCAR, Volvo, Toyota and Uber and will work together to develop and scale Aurora Driver-powered trucks and self-driving passenger vehicles. Our partners are industry leaders in their respective fields and we are able to leverage each of our respective strengths as we commercialize. This allows us to scale faster and more efficiently. With PACCAR and Volvo, we are partnered with OEMs holding almost 50% of the US truck market; with Toyota, we are partnered with the number one passenger car OEM in the world; and with Uber, we are partnered with the number one ride hailing company in the world. We believe partnerships like these will be important in being able to bring a safe, scalable solution to market quickly.
Efficiency of development and operation
We believe that our approach to technological development, coupled with our Driver as a Service business model, enables us to develop and scale our technology efficiently. This is further enhanced by our collaboration with Uber, which allows us access to proprietary anonymized data related to trip demand and economics. This data allows us to optimize our development roadmap to invest in the highest value markets and capabilities.
Mission-driven corporate culture.
From the beginning, we have invested in building a mission-driven company based on a set of values that drive who we are and how we operate. A strong, inclusive, and effective culture is fundamental for the long-term success of a business, and even more so when delivering a technology as complex and transformative as self-driving. We are building an enduring company and our culture and values represent an advantage in delivering and scaling our product.
Our Product
The Aurora Driver
We are building the Aurora Driver – the hardware, software, and services to enable safe, cost-efficient, and high-uptime autonomous driving service. The Aurora Driver is based on a common driver platform design that can integrate with vehicles of various makes, models, and classes to serve multiple commercial applications.
Aurora’s custom-designed hardware suite includes full sensor coverage on three sensing modalities: lidar, radar, and camera, as well as high-performance computing to enable rapid response time. The computer powers Aurora’s self-driving software, which plans a safe path of motion for the vehicle in order to reach its destination.
The Aurora Driver has been designed to be consistent and transferable across different vehicle types, be it a sedan, a van, or a Class 8 truck. This includes purposeful design choices including a hardware suite that is consistent across vehicle types, software that adapts to the unique dynamics of the vehicle it controls, and a system interface over a single umbilical.
As of December 31, 2021, the Aurora Driver had been successfully integrated across eight different vehicle platforms. The commercial self-driving vehicles that integrate with the Aurora Driver will include redundant steering, braking, and power to promote safe vehicle operation in the event of a component failure. We work closely with our OEM partners to develop a safe, reliable, and scalable integrated solution.
Driver as a Service Business Model
The Aurora Driver will be delivered as a service via Aurora Horizon, our driverless trucking product, and Aurora Connect, our driverless ride hailing product. We intend to partner with our ecosystem of OEMs, fleet operators, and mobility and logistics services, as well as other third parties, to commercialize and support Aurora-powered vehicles. With our business model, fleet owners will purchase Aurora Driver-powered vehicles from our OEM partners, subscribe to the Aurora Driver, and utilize Aurora-certified fleet service partners to operate autonomous mobility and logistics services. In many instances, the same party may play multiple roles: for example, our OEM partners will in certain cases also provide maintenance services and act as a fleet operator.
By subscribing to the Aurora Driver, our customers will be able to receive access to the following:
1.Aurora Driver hardware and software to enable safe and efficient autonomous operation of the self-driving fleet;
2.Updates to the Aurora Driver, including map and software updates;
3.Access to the Aurora Cloud platform, which will interface with their systems and enable efficient dispatch, deployment, and fleet monitoring;
4.Teleassistance support, where trained specialists monitor Aurora Driver-powered vehicles and provide high level guidance when needed; and
5.Access to Aurora-certified third party services, including maintenance of the Aurora Driver, roadside assistance for the Aurora Driver, and insurance.
Components of the offering such as maintenance, hardware financing, and insurance, will be delivered in partnership with our third-party partner network. We believe that this business model uniquely allows us to scale in a high margin way, and succeed as our customers succeed.
Technology
Our Technological Advantages
Since our inception, we have taken a clean sheet approach to the way we build our technology, leveraging our team’s past experience and learnings. We have made purposeful, foundational technological investments that we believe will enable us to move towards meaningful commercialization more safely, quickly, and broadly. Examples of this ‘self-driving 2.0’ approach, across both hardware & software, include:
1.Proprietary lidar technology to unlock highway speeds;
2.Next-generation approach to Perception and Planning that leverages the distinct strengths of both machine learning and engineered approaches;
3.Common driver platform approach which allows our system to scale onto different vehicle types, such as cars and Class 8 trucks;
4.Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite, which increases engineering velocity; and
5.Scalable approach to high-definition maps
Proprietary Lidar technology
Aurora’s long-range, multi-modal sensing suite consists of high-resolution, high dynamic range and long-range cameras, next-generation imaging radar, and our industry-leading proprietary FirstLight Lidar.
FirstLight alone provides a number of meaningful performance advantages over traditional lidar sensors. Traditional pulsed lidar is amplitude-modulated (AM), which works by emitting brief light pulses at a fixed frequency. The locations of objects are determined based on how long it takes for those laser pulses to bounce off surfaces and return to the sensor. The challenge with AM lidar is that it has limited range, requires multiple measurements to estimate speed, and is susceptible to lidar-to-lidar and solar interference. Aurora’s FirstLight uses frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar technology. This has a number of key advantages, which we believe are critical to unlocking safe operation at highway speeds:
1.Greater Range. Our lidar can see nearly twice as far as a typical automotive AM lidar, because our coherent measurement enables single-photon sensitivity. The enhanced range of our FMCW lidar enables the detection and tracking of objects and actors at the very long ranges essential for high-speed driving.
2.Simultaneous Range and Velocity. FirstLight instantaneously measures the radial velocity of the targets as well as distance. This allows quicker reaction times and better tracking of other objects on or near the road.
3.Interference Immunity. Each FirstLight sensor is primarily sensitive to only the signals it creates. Therefore, it benefits from immunity to interference from ambient sunlight and to lidar-to-lidar interference, which will be important as self-driving fleets scale.
Leveraging the Best of Machine Learning and Engineered Approaches
Aurora’s approach to designing the Aurora Driver software leverages our team’s expertise in both machine learning and fundamental engineering. Use of either approach for solving a problem has advantages and disadvantages, and therefore the thoughtful fusion of both is critical to creating a safe and scalable system. The key distinctions between machine learning and engineering are that:
•Engineered systems are built by humans and tend to be simpler and more introspectable (i.e. can understand ‘why’ an action is taken).
•Machine-learned systems are tuned and developed by algorithms and trained on data. This can allow for greater nuance and complexity, and have the additional advantage that new data can improve overall performance. However, machine-learned systems are less introspectable than engineered systems.
Aurora’s software teams are selective in their application of each, and frequently bring both to bear on a single task in ways that utilize the independent strengths of each to create a higher-performance system.
An example of this is the Planning system. As the Aurora Driver operates, it uses an engineered approach to maintain appropriate safety buffers—an example is maintaining sufficiently safe following distance, such that the Aurora Driver can stop safely even if the car in front of it brakes aggressively. Using this engineered approach permits strong safety guarantees. However, a system built around such guarantees alone would not drive in a human-like fashion, and may act in such a way that other road users would find it unpredictable. Therefore, we also employ a machine-learned approach where the system learns from exemplary human drivers how to naturally behave during many commonplace interactions, such as merging onto a highway—subject to the buffers defined by the engineered system. Interleaving these two methods allows for the creation of verifiably safe, and natural, driving behavior.
Common Driver Platform Approach
The Aurora Driver has been designed from the ground up to support multiple automakers and commercial applications with the same core hardware and software. We invested early in a hardware suite that is consistent across vehicle platforms, and software that adapts to the unique behaviors, constraints, and dynamics of whatever vehicle it controls—whether that be a Class 8 tractor or light passenger vehicle.
The Aurora Driver uses the same hardware suite across trucks and passenger vehicles. Because all Aurora-Driver powered vehicles carry a common set of self-driving hardware and software, Aurora and its partners benefit from the collective scale of all participants on the platform.
Significant Investments in Virtual Development
Our Virtual Testing Suite is a major engineering accelerator. Virtual testing refers to any time that our system is being tested in response to synthetic or historical data as opposed to operating in real-time on the road. Aurora incorporates frequent and extensive use of virtual testing.
There are numerous benefits to virtual testing:
•Efficiency. Aurora’s motion planning simulation is 2,500 times less expensive than on-road testing.
•Speed. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite can scale to continuously simulate the equivalent of over 50,000 trucks on the road. This figure will grow both as a result of increased technological innovation inside Aurora, as well as from expanding scale available from leading cloud computing providers.
•Safety. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite dramatically reduces the number of on-road miles of driving needed to develop the Aurora Driver, which reduces exposure to risk associated with on-road testing.
•Variation. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite can automatically alter details to create myriad permutations from a single scenario encountered on the road, and even simulate scenarios we have not previously encountered on the road. We can adjust factors like weather, traffic density, or pedestrian behavior. We can quickly test against many thousands of likely variations to understand how the system would have responded. 
•Repeatability. As our sensor stack evolves, our Virtual Testing Suite remains relevant, whereas past real-world data collected on an out-of-date sensor stack becomes obsolete. We believe this is unique to Aurora due to our industry-leading expertise in sensor data simulation and systemically generating new scenarios.
Aurora has invested significantly in virtual testing at a time when much of the self-driving industry was focused on real world mileage accumulation. We believe that as the industry reaches the long tail of development, these investments will increasingly accelerate our path to market and scale relative to competitors.
Scalable Approach to High-definition Mapping
Aurora’s approach to mapping aims to optimize for two factors: first, a map that is maximally relevant to the challenges of self-driving; and second, a map that can be maintained at scale.
The Aurora Atlas is a map purpose-designed for these goals. It is broken into smaller maps that cover sub-areas, which are referred to as shards. Many classic maps have not been built for self-driving and thus prioritize global positioning accuracy at a substantial detriment to local accuracy. Aurora’s map shards, however, prioritize being locally accurate, as it is far more important that the Aurora Driver knows the location of nearby actors and objects as accurately as possible rather than where it is in some global sense. We do this without sacrificing any meaningful amount of the Aurora Driver’s broader context about where it is in the world or along a route.
The sharded, locally consistent approach to the Aurora Atlas enables scalability. Rebuilding the content of a shard takes minutes, whereas for classic maps, these areas can be the size of an entire city and take far longer to adjust. Swapping out a shard in a live deployed map is possible to do rapidly over-the-air, whereas deploying an entirely new map for a city requires a lengthy process. Finally, as the Aurora Driver begins to operate in new areas, the increase in mapped content will not alter existing content or require any editing/re-release of past maps, which a non-sharded approach would require; this keeps existing operational support much simpler even under a rapid expansion plan.
Our Culture
Aurora’s values guide our work and culture and support our ability to deliver our mission. They set the tone for the way we operate, they define who we are and how we do things, and they guide us when we face difficult situations. Our values are:
1.Operate with integrity. We do the right thing. Our success depends on being trustworthy. Our task is to build and earn trust with everything that we do;
2.Focus. We are solving one of the most challenging problems of our generation—and we’ll get there by fostering a culture of depth, focus, and rigorous engineering;
3.No jerks. We solve hard technical problems through discussion and collaboration. We assume the best intent in people and trust we are all working towards the common goal;
4.Be reasonable. We expect each other to use good judgment and always have the best interest of the company and our partners in mind;

6.Win together. We are building a technology and a company that will serve people and communities around the world. Our team’s diverse perspective and experience makes us stronger, and better reflects the world we live in.
Competition
Our main sources of competition fall into two categories:
•Technology-focused companies building end-to-end technical capabilities for self-driving applications
•Automotive players building internal self-driving development programs
The principal competitive success factors in our market, in no particular order, include, but are not limited to:
•Technology quality, reliability, and safety
•Engineering capabilities
•Business model and go-to-market approach
•Commercial partnerships
•Cost and efficiency
•Patents and intellectual property portfolio
Because of the depth and breadth of our talent, fully integrated self-driving stack, differentiated go-to-market approach, and unique partnerships that drive commercialization at scale, we believe that we are able to compete favorably across these factors.
Intellectual Property
Our success and competitive advantage depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect our core technology and intellectual property. We own a portfolio of intellectual property, including patents and registered trademarks, confidential technical information, and expertise in the development of software and hardware for autonomous vehicles and lidar technology.
We have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. We also rely on trade secrets, design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing and exclusivity opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments and products in the industry.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned over 1,100 patents and pending applications, including U.S. and foreign. In addition, we have 4 registered U.S. trademarks, 30 registered foreign trademarks and 21 pending trademark applications. Our patents and patent applications cover a broad range of technology relevant to self-driving vehicles.
In connection with our acquisition of Apparate, we acquired certain intellectual property that may be the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding claim by Anthony Levandowski. We are not a party to those proceedings. In the event that the bankruptcy court rules in favor of Mr. Levandowski with respect to his bankruptcy claims against Uber, certain of the intellectual property we acquired in our acquisition of Apparate may be adversely affected.
Material Agreements
PACCAR Strategic Partnership
In January 2021, we entered into a global strategic partnership with PACCAR in preparation for the launch of the Aurora Driver’s first application in trucking. This partnership combines PACCAR’s considerable expertise in heavy-duty truck development, manufacturing, and sales with our deep understanding of autonomous vehicle technology to bring a safe, efficient self-driving product to market quickly and deploy it broadly. This partnership brings PACCAR and Aurora engineering teams together around an accelerated development program to create truly driverless-capable trucks, starting with the Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680. PACCAR and Aurora plan to develop a suite of self-driving fleet services, including servicing and maintenance for the deployment and operation of these trucks at scale over the next several years.
Uber Strategic Partnership
In January 2021, we acquired Uber’s self-driving unit. This acquisition expanded our talent base by over 900 employees, and we gained significant research and technical assets that strengthened and accelerated the first Aurora Driver application for heavy-duty trucks while allowing us to continue and accelerate our work on light-vehicle products.
In addition to acquiring Uber’s self-driving unit, we announced a strategic partnership with Uber that connects our technology to the world’s leading ride-hailing platform and strengthens our position to deliver the Aurora Driver broadly. In support of our partnership with Uber, and concurrent with the acquisition of Uber’s self-driving unit, Uber invested $400 million in Aurora and Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi is a member of our board of directors.
As part of our partnership with Uber, we receive unique access to Uber data. This allows more efficient development and operation, as we are able to refine our market selection and prioritize our capability roadmap based on real-world data.
Toyota Strategic Collaboration
In February 2021, we announced a long-term, global, and strategic collaboration with Toyota and DENSO, one of the largest global automotive manufacturers and tier-one automotive suppliers, respectively, to build and globally deploy self-driving cars at scale.
As part of this collaboration, our engineering teams will jointly develop and test driverless-capable vehicles equipped with the Aurora Driver, starting with the Toyota Sienna. As part of this long-term effort, we will be exploring mass production of key autonomous driving components with DENSO and a comprehensive services solution with Toyota for when these vehicles are deployed at scale, including financing, insurance, maintenance, and more. These efforts will lay the foundation for the mass-production, launch, and support of these vehicles with Toyota on ride-hailing networks, including Uber’s.
Volvo Group Strategic Partnership
In March 2021, Volvo selected us as its technology provider to develop and commercialize Level 4 Class 8 trucks in North America. Our first commercial truck with Volvo will be adapted to the requirements of the Aurora Driver. These trucks will combine the best of Volvo’s technology with the Aurora Driver into a compelling and scalable logistics platform.
As Volvo’s official technology partner, we will develop an unprecedented autonomous offering with one of the most trusted commercial truck manufacturers in the world. This partnership will be the center of the integration of the Aurora Driver into Volvo’s on-highway trucks and development of industry-leading Transportation as a Service solutions.
Government Regulation
At both the federal and state level, the U.S. provides a positive regulatory environment to permit safe testing and development of autonomous vehicle functionality. Aurora’s Government Relations team regularly engages with our partners in government to further develop the relationships and regulations necessary to successfully deploy our technology.
Aurora has developed bipartisan support of self-driving technology in both chambers of the U.S. Congress as well as the U.S. Department of Transportation and its agencies. At Aurora, we work with the federal government to ensure it maintains its regulatory authority over the design, construction, and performance of vehicles and applies that same authority to the regulation of highly automated vehicles.
As vehicles equipped with our sensors are deployed on public roads, we will be subject to legal and regulatory authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), state agencies like Departments of Transportation or Departments of Motor Vehicles, and local transportation departments. As the development of federal, state and foreign legal frameworks around autonomous vehicles continue to evolve, we may be subject to additional regulatory schemes. We do not anticipate any near-term federal standards that would impede the foreseeable deployments of our technology. U.S. federal regulations are largely permissive of deployments of higher levels of safe and responsible autonomous functionality. 
States, such as Arizona, Florida, Nevada, and Texas, continue to attract self-driving companies with a welcoming regulatory climate that provides the predictability necessary to deploy our technology in those communities. Some states, particularly California, institute operational requirements or restrictions for certain autonomous functions. We believe such hurdles will be removed as we work with our government partners to highlight the benefits of self-driving technology. We work closely with state and local elected officials and regulatory bodies to ensure they continue to welcome the testing and deployment of self-driving vehicles on their roads. By working with these officials to develop technology neutral policies that promote a diverse set of highly automated vehicle use cases and create a level playing field for the industry, we believe that Aurora will be able deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly.
Similar such reporting and regulatory requirements exist in foreign markets. For example, markets such as the EU also continue to develop their respective standards to define deployment requirements for higher levels of autonomy. Germany, a leader in the automotive industry, recently approved legislation that would allow for the deployment of self-driving technology without a human driver. Given the intense work in these areas, we expect a workable path forward in the near-term.
We are subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products.
Similarly, as a company deploying cutting-edge technology with international partners, we are also subject to trade, customs product classification and sourcing regulations. Finally, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
Like all companies operating in similar industries, we are subject to environmental regulation, including water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with these rules may include permits, licenses and inspections of our facilities and products.
Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability
Achieving our mission—delivering the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly—is how we aim to make a positive impact in communities. We strive to revolutionize transportation by making roads safer, providing better services for people who currently have difficulty accessing transportation, freeing up time during commutes, and helping goods more efficiently reach those who need them. Successfully achieving our mission also means promoting development across and around the transportation landscape by creating new opportunities and access to the economy.
As part of our commitment to work with communities where Aurora has a presence and educate them on the benefits of self-driving technology, we partner with local organizations that help bridge the digital divide and promote STEM education. Our Aurora Community Engagement (ACE) Program works with our local partners to identify opportunities for Aurora employees to volunteer in our community specifically with programs that strengthen and diversify the STEM workforce.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to diversity and inclusion. One of our core values — Win Together — is based on bringing together diverse background and perspectives. We celebrate the diversity of the people, experiences, and backgrounds that make up Aurora, and we encourage each other to speak up and share perspectives, respectfully and thoughtfully. We are building technology that will impact all people, so we strive to foster and embrace diversity throughout our business and our teams to bring us closer to those we serve.
Sustainability
Fostering a sustainable environment is also important to us. Starting in 2019, we offset our estimated annual carbon emissions from our facilities, vehicles and air travel by purchasing carbon credits, and we expect to continue to do this in the future. Longer-term, we believe commercialization of our self-driving technology will contribute to a more sustainable future given the potential to materially reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
