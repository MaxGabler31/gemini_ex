ITEM 1. Business
Our Company
 
BorrowMoney.com, Inc. (“Borrowmoney.com”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) operates what we believe to be the leading online loan marketplace for consumers seeking loans and other credit-based offerings. Our online marketplace provides consumers with access to product offerings from active lenders (which we refer to as “Network Lenders”), including mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, personal loans, student loans, small business loans and other related offerings. In addition, we offer tools and resources, including free credit scores, that facilitate comparison shopping for these loans, deposits and other credit-based offerings. We seek to match consumers with multiple lenders, who can provide them with competing quotes for the product they are seeking. By providing consumers access to a broad array of credit-based offerings directly from multiple lenders, rather than just multiple quotes from the same lender or indirectly through intermediaries, we believe our marketplace is differentiated from other providers operating loan comparison-shopping marketplaces.
 
Our strategically designed and executed advertising and marketing campaigns (which we refer to as performance marketing) span a wide array of digital and traditional media acquisition channels and promote our Borrowmoney.com and other brands and product offerings. Our marketing efforts are designed to attract consumers to our websites and toll-free telephone numbers. Interested consumers complete inquiry forms, providing detailed information about themselves and the loans or other offerings they are seeking. We refer to such consumer inquiries as loan requests. We then match these loan requests with lenders in our marketplace that are seeking to serve these consumers’ needs. We generate revenue from these lenders, generally at the time of transmitting a loan request to them, in the form of a match fee. In certain instances outside our mortgage business, we charge other kinds of fees, such as closed loan or closed sale fees. In addition to our primary loan request data referral business, BorrowMoney also matches consumers with lenders via website clicks and calls for which lenders pay either front-end or back-end fees.
 
We are continually working to improve the consumer experience. We have made investments in technologically-adept personnel and we use in-market real-time testing to improve our digital platforms. Additionally, we work with our lenders, including providing training and other resources, to improve the consumer experience throughout the loan process. Further, we have been building and improving our My BorrowMoney platform, which provides a relationship-based consumer experience, rather than just a transaction-based experience.
 
Evolution and Future Growth of Our Business
 
At its inception, our original business was to serve consumers seeking home mortgage loans by matching them with various lenders. We launched the Borrowmoney.com brand nationally in 2010 and, over the last eight years, we invested significantly in this brand to gain consumer recognition.
 
More recently, we have actively sought to expand the suite of loan and other product offerings we provide to consumers, in order to both leverage the applicability of the BorrowMoney.com brand as well as more fully serve the needs of consumers and lenders. We believe that consumers with existing BorrowMoney-branded associations will be more likely to utilize our other service offerings than those of other providers whose brands consumers may not recognize.
 
In June 2016, we launched My Borrowmoney.com, a platform that offers a personalized loan comparison-shopping experience, by providing free credit scores and credit score analysis. This platform enables us to observe consumers’ credit profiles and then identify and alert them to loan and other credit-based offerings on our marketplace that may be more favorable than the loans they have at a given point in time. This is designed to provide consumers with measurable savings opportunities over their lifetimes.

By expanding our portfolio of loans and other product offerings, we are growing and diversifying our business and sources of revenue. We intend to capitalize on our expertise in performance marketing, product development and technology, and to leverage the widespread recognition of the Borrowmone.com brand to effect this strategy.
 
We believe the consumer and small business financial services industry is still the early stages of a fundamental shift to online product offerings, similar to the shift that started in retail and travel many years ago and is now well established. We believe that, like retail and travel, as consumers continue to move towards online shopping and transactions for financial services, suppliers will increasingly shift their product offerings and advertising budgets toward the online channel. We believe the strength of our brands and of our lender network place us in a strong position to continue to benefit from this market shift.
 
Recent Business Acquisitions
 
We are not reviewing any acquisition at the present time.
 
Products
 
We currently report our revenues in two product categories: (i) mortgage products and (ii) non-mortgage products. Non-mortgage products include credit cards, personal loans, home equity loans, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, small business loans and student loans. Non-mortgage products also include deposit accounts, home improvement referrals and other credit products such as credit repair and debt settlement.
 
Mortgage and non-mortgage product revenue is as follow:
 

 | For the Year Ended August 31, | 
----------------------+-------------------------------+--
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Mortgage products | $ | - | | $ | - 
Non-mortgage products | | - | | | 14,936
Total revenue | $ | - | | $ | 14,936

 
BorrowMoney.com does not charge consumers or small businesses for the use of our services. Revenues from our mortgage products are mostly derived from upfront match fees paid by Network Lenders that receive a loan request, and in some cases upfront fees for clicks or call transfers. Because a given loan request form can be matched with more than one Network Lender, up to five match fees may be generated from a single consumer loan request form. Revenues from our non-mortgage products are derived from upfront match fees paid on delivery of a loan request, click or call and closed loan fees. For our product, we send click traffic to issuers and are paid per approval.
 
Mortgage Products
 
Our mortgage inquiry products category includes our purchase and refinance products.
 
We partner with lenders throughout the United States to provide full geographic lending coverage and to offer a complete suite of loan offerings on our marketplace. To participate on our marketplace, lenders are required to enter into contracts with us that state the terms and conditions for such participation, although these contracts generally may be terminated for convenience by either party. We perform certain due diligence procedures on prospective new lenders, including screening against a national anti-fraud database maintained by the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, which helps manage our risk exposure. The data is utilized to determine whether a lender and its principals are eligible to participate on our marketplace and have not been convicted of and/or penalized for fraudulent activity.

Consumers seeking mortgage loans through our loan marketplace can receive multiple conditional loan offers from participating lenders in response to a single loan request form. We refer to the process by which we match consumers and Network Lenders as the matching process. This matching process consists of the following steps:
 

1) | Loan Request. Consumers complete a single loan request form with information regarding the type of mortgage loan product they are seeking, loan preferences and other data. Consumers also consent to a soft inquiry regarding their credit. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Loan Request Form Matching and Transmission. Our proprietary systems and technology match a given consumer’s loan request form data, credit profile and geographic location against certain pre-established criteria of Network Lenders, which may be modified from time to time. Once a given loan request passes through the matching process, the loan request is automatically transmitted to up to five participating Network Lenders. 
3) | Lender Evaluation and Response. Network Lenders that receive a loan request form evaluate the information contained in it to determine whether to make a conditional loan offer. 
4) | Communication of a Conditional Offer. All matched Network Lenders and any conditional offers are presented to the consumer upon completion of the loan request form. Consumers can return to the site and view their offer(s) at any time by logging in to their My BorroMoney.com profile. Additionally, matched lenders and offers are also sent to the email address associated with the consumer request. 

 
We also offer consumers other mortgage products such as:
 

● | an alternative “short-form” matching process, which provides them with lender contact information rather than conditional offers from Network Lenders, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a “rate table” loan marketplace, where consumers can enter their loan and credit profile and dynamically view real-time rates from lenders without entering their contact information. 

 
Non-Mortgage Products
 
Lending Products. Other lending products on our online marketplace include information, tools and access to multiple conditional loan offers for the following:
 

● | Auto, which includes our auto refinance and purchase loan products. Auto loans enable consumers to purchase new or used vehicles or refinance an existing loan secured by an automobile. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Home equity loans and lines of credit, which enable home owners to borrow against the equity in their home, as measured by the difference between the market value of the home and any existing loans secured by the home. Home equity loans are one-time lump sum loans, whereas a home equity line of credit reflects a line of revolving credit where the borrower has flexibility to draw down and repay the line 
● | Personal loans, which are unsecured obligations generally carrying shorter terms and smaller loan amounts than home mortgages. 
● | Reverse mortgage loans, which are a loan product available to qualifying homeowners age 
● | Small business loans, which include a broad array of financing types, including but not limited to loans secured by working capital, equipment, real estate and other forms of financing, provided to small and medium-sized businesses 
● | Student loans, which includes both new loans to finance an education and related expenses, as well as refinancing of existing loans.

We intend to continue adding new lending offerings for consumers, small businesses and lenders on our online marketplace, in order to grow and diversify our sources of revenue. We may develop such new offerings through internal product development efforts, strategic business relationships with third parties and/or acquisitions.
Other Products. Other products also includes information, tools and access to the following:
 

● | Small business loans, which include a broad array of financing types, including but not limited to loans secured by working capital, equipment, real estate and other forms of financing, provided to small and medium-sized businesses 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Student loans, which includes both new loans to finance an education and related expenses, as well as refinancing of existing loans. 
● | Deposit accounts, through which consumers can access depository deals and analysis covering all major deposit product categories. 
● | Credit repair, through which consumers can obtain assistance improving their credit profiles, in order to expand and improve loan and other financial product opportunities available to them. 
● | Debt relief services, through which consumers can obtain assistance negotiating existing loans 
● | Home improvement services, through which consumers have the opportunity to research and find home improvement professional services. 
● | Personal credit data, through which consumers can gain insights into how prospective lenders and other third parties view their credit profiles. 
● | Real estate brokerage services, through which consumers are matched with local realtors who can assist them in their home purchase or sale efforts. 
● | Various consumer insurance products, including home and automobile, through which consumers are matched with insurance lead aggregators to obtain insurance offers. 

 
We refer to the various purchasers of leads from our other marketplaces as lead purchasers. We generate revenue from the deposit account product from a consumer clicking from our website through to a financial institution’s website. We generate revenue through the insurance products and real estate brokerage services through match fees paid to us by insurance lead aggregators and real estate brokers participating in our online marketplace. We generate revenue from credit repair and debt relief services either through a fee for a customer referral to a service provider partner or through a fee at the time a consumer enrolls in a program with one of our partners. Revenue for home services is derived primarily through matching of leads to other home services lead aggregators.
 
Seasonality
 
Revenue in our lending business is subject to cyclical and seasonal trends. Home sales (and purchase mortgages) typically rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months, while refinancing and home equity activity is principally driven by mortgage interest rates as well as real estate values. However, in certain historical periods additional factors affecting the mortgage and real estate markets, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis and ensuing recession have impacted customary seasonal trends.
 
We anticipate revenue in our newer products to be cyclical as well; however, we have limited historical data to predict the nature and magnitude of this cyclicality. Based on industry data, we anticipate that as our personal loan product matures we will experience less consumer demand during the fourth and first quarters of each year. we anticipate higher consumer demand for deposit accounts in the first quarter of each year. The majority of consumer demand for student loan products occurs in the third quarter coinciding with collegiate enrollment in late summer. Other factors affecting our businesses include macro factors such as credit availability in the market, interest rates, the strength of the economy and employment.

Competition
 
Our lending and other businesses compete with other online marketing companies, including online intermediaries that operate network-type arrangements. We also face competition from lenders that source consumer loan originations directly. These companies typically operate consumer-branded websites and attract consumers via online banner ads, keyword placement on search engines, direct mail, television ads, retail branches, realtors, brokers, radio and other sources, partnerships with affiliates and business development arrangements with others, including major online portals.
Product Development
 
We invest in the continued development of both new and existing products to enhance the experiences of consumers and lenders as they interact with us.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property rights are vital to our success. To protect our intellectual property rights in our brand, technology, products, improvements and inventions, we rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, patents and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, including confidentiality agreements with strategic partners, employees, consultants and other third parties. As new or improved proprietary technologies are developed or inventions are identified, we seek patent protection in the United States and abroad, as appropriate.
 
Many of our services are offered under proprietary trademarks and service marks. We generally apply to register or secure by contract our principal trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used. We have 2 trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These registrations can typically be renewed at 10-year intervals.
 
We reserve and register domain names when and where we deem appropriate and we currently have over 50 registered domain names. We also have agreements with third parties that provide for the licensing of patented and proprietary technology used in our business.
 
From time to time, we may be subjected to legal proceedings and claims, or threatened legal proceedings or claims, including allegations of infringement of third-party trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, the use of litigation and other dispute resolution processes, such as Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution, may be necessary for us to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2018, we had 4 employees, of which are temporary or part-time contractors. The employees are not currently compensated but are part of a voluntary training program. None of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with employees and independent contractors to be good.
