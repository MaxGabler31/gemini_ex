Item 1. Business
Our Mission
Our mission is to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love, and thrive.
Overview
Toast is a cloud-based, all-in-one digital technology platform purpose-built for the entire restaurant community. Our platform provides a comprehensive suite of software as a service, or SaaS, products, financial technology solutions including integrated payment processing, restaurant-grade hardware, and a broad ecosystem of third-party partners. We serve as the restaurant operating system, connecting front of house and back of house operations across dine-in, takeout, and delivery channels. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 57,000 restaurant locations, processing over $57 billion of gross payment volume in the trailing 12 months, partnered with Toast to optimize operations, increase sales, engage guests, and maintain happy employees.
Our Market
The approximately 860,000 restaurant locations in the United States are highly diverse and complex. In general, restaurants operate with low margins, high employee turnover, highly perishable products, and complex regulations. At the same time, the restaurant industry is undergoing foundational changes driven by changing guest preferences and the imperative to utilize technology and data to innovate. What was once primarily an on-site experience with antiquated solutions is now becoming an omnichannel experience that employs technology to enable dining in a restaurant, picking up curbside, or ordering delivery.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the restaurant industry. As a result of state-mandated decisions to shutter in-store dining in March 2020, weekly same-store restaurant sales nationwide plummeted nearly 75% virtually overnight, followed by ongoing government restrictions, including limiting service to takeout orders for a period of time or reducing capacity to accommodate social distancing recommendations. As a leading platform for the restaurant industry, Toast took immediate steps to help restaurants navigate the crisis, transition to off-premise dining through existing products such as Online Ordering and new product launches, and call much needed attention to an industry in need of guest and government support. 
Consumer preference towards omnichannel dining options has further accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the National Restaurant Association, in 2020, 53% of adults said that purchasing food for takeout or delivery is essential to the way they live, up from 29% a decade earlier. They also found approximately 70% of restaurant operators plan to keep some of the changes that they made to their restaurant as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has also been a transformation in how guests purchase their food. Credit cards, mobile wallets, and other digital payment solutions have increased in popularity among guests. Cash sales as a percent of total sales through our platform declined from approximately 25% in 2015 to 11% by 2021. As the diversity of how guests order, where guests eat, and the means guests use to pay continues to grow, restaurants must constantly adapt to support these trends.
We believe we are in the early stages of capturing our addressable market opportunity. As of December 31, 2021, the locations on our platform represented only about 7% of the approximately 860,000 restaurant locations in the United States. Similarly, our Annualized Recurring Run-Rate, or ARR, as of December 31, 2021 was only about 4% of our near-term serviceable market opportunity of approximately $15 billion. We see a significant opportunity to increase sales to both new and existing customers, expand the usage of our platform outside the United States, and address the diverse needs of new and existing restaurant industry stakeholders.
Our Products and Platform
Toast’s all-in-one platform powers the entire restaurant community. Our portfolio spans seven product categories: point of sale, restaurant operations, digital ordering & delivery, marketing & loyalty, team management, financial technology solutions, and platform & insights. Alongside this platform, our commitment to customer success drives a differentiated customer experience, powers operational innovation, and enables our and our restaurants’ long-term growth and success.
As restaurants adopt more of our platform, our solutions work better together to drive even more success for them. For example, when a restaurant switches from pen and paper to using Order & Pay, they collect guest data that was previously not available to them. This guest data can then fuel our marketing solutions, increasing the likelihood of a return visit to the restaurant or driving the guest to the restaurant’s online ordering channel with Toast, eliminating a third-party commission driving incremental margin for the restaurant.
As customers have realized the value of our full platform, we have seen them adopt more Toast products. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 59% of Toast locations used four or more core products, on top of our integrated point of sale, or POS, and payments solution, up from approximately 48% as of December 31, 2020 and approximately 37% as of December 31, 2019.
Point of Sale
•Software. Our Android-based software has been custom built for the restaurant industry and is the foundation that powers each of our vertically integrated solutions. Our proprietary software enables seamless connectivity across restaurant operations, guests, and employees, and drives a differentiated dining experience.
◦Toast POS: Our core software module supports our hardware products to reduce wait times, optimize operations, and seamlessly handle payments. Toast POS is easy to use, leverages consumer technology, allows restaurant employees to quickly get up to speed on the software and seamlessly use it throughout their day. We provide color coded tables and kitchen tickets, mobile alerts, and guest text messaging to help keep restaurant staff on top of their service. For example, when a dish is ready, kitchen staff can alert the server right on their Toast Go or send a text message directly to a guest for a pick-up order.
◦Toast Order & Pay: Our order and pay allows guests to pay directly from their mobile devices, which allows restaurants to have additional flexibility in staffing while providing a great restaurant experience, driving sales, capturing guest insights, and reducing table turn times.
•Hardware. Our restaurant-grade hardware is custom built to withstand the rigors of a restaurant, combining durability needed for the restaurant environment, with aesthetically pleasing designs and in-store branding, serving as the tool that helps deliver our end-to-end solutions.
◦Toast Flex: Our proprietary hardware can be used for on-counter order and pay, but can also be used as a server station, guest kiosk, kitchen display system, or order fulfillment station, allowing the restaurant to “flex” our hardware to fit their specific needs.
◦Toast Go: Our fully-integrated, handheld POS device enhances the guest experience and improves table turn times through tableside ordering and payment acceptance. The Toast Go enables real-time menu updates, accelerated service, easy and accurate ordering, and contactless payments.
◦Toast Tap: Our proprietary card reader supports Near Field Communication, or NFC, Europay, Mastercard and Visa, collectively referred to as EMV, and magnetic stripe reader, or MSR, payments, and creates a frictionless experience for our guests.
Restaurant Operations
•Software
◦Kitchen Display System: Our proprietary Kitchen Display System software seamlessly connects the front of the house with the kitchen staff. Our software fully integrates all ordering stations with the kitchen, automates firing by prep time, and instantaneously notifies servers when orders are ready.
◦Multi-Location Management: Our Multi-Location Management tool allows our customers to manage and standardize their operations and easily configure menus across multiple locations and channels, including online ordering and delivery. Customers can set location-specific items and prices or keep them consistent across the brand, and centralize data across all locations for a single, clear view of business performance.
◦xtraCHEF by Toast: xtraCHEF provides a suite of back-office tools for restaurants, including accounts payable automation and inventory management. xtraCHEF arms operators to take control of rising inventory costs, automate accounts payable, and streamline back-office tasks to increase overall profitability.
•Hardware
◦Toast Flex for Kitchen: Toast Flex for Kitchen is a larger format, mountable display that can be used as a kitchen screen or order fulfillment station to help restaurants run their kitchens smoothly. Heat and water resistance allows the Toast Flex for Kitchen to stand up to real-world use in the kitchen.
Digital Ordering & Delivery
•Toast Online Ordering & Toast TakeOut: Our commission-free online ordering and consumer Toast TakeOut application simplifies the digital ordering experience for guests, increases order accuracy, and allows restaurants to reduce reliance on third parties for driving online orders. By providing restaurants with a software-based platform to take off-premise orders directly through their branded website, we reduce phone orders, minimize double entry and other costly errors, and optimize the balance between dine-in and takeout.
•First-Party Delivery, Toast Delivery Services, and Toast Delivery Partners: Toast enables restaurants to offer delivery services in a variety of ways that can be tailored to their needs and operations. With first-party delivery, restaurants can manage their own fleet of drivers and customize delivery hours, zones, fees, and minimum ticket sizes. Toast Delivery Services enables restaurants to utilize a partner network of delivery drivers so restaurants can offer delivery to guests without needing their own fleet. Finally, through Toast Delivery Partners, we provide POS integrations for restaurants using third-party delivery services to streamline order intake, eliminate the need for extra third-party tablets, and sync menus in real-time.
 Marketing and Loyalty
•Loyalty and Gift Cards: Toast has designed a suite of guest-focused products, including loyalty programs and branded gift cards, to enhance a restaurant’s cash flow by driving further engagement with their guests. Our credit-card linked loyalty program automatically accrues points each time the guest swipes their card and offers can be customized by the restaurant to drive repeat visits and increased spend over time.
•Marketing: Our data driven insights allow restaurants to easily create and send email campaigns based on POS data such as visit frequency and spending patterns that are automatically built through daily guest interactions across our product suite.
Team Management
•Payroll & Team Management: Employee performance and satisfaction are important elements of a restaurant’s success. We have created a centralized hub that streamlines the entire hiring, employee management, and payroll process. Integrated POS and payroll create a single employee record across systems, allowing for hours, tips, and employee data to synchronize seamlessly and helping managers get valuable time back.
•Partner-Enabled Products (Insurance & Benefits): Toast offers workers compensation, business owner policy, or BOP, insurance, automated 401k, as well as restaurant-specific add-ons, such as liquor liability insurance, through our partners therefore simplifying the procurement process for restaurants and providing much-requested benefits to their teams.
Financial Technology Solutions
•Payment Processing: Toast provides a fully-integrated platform that enables our customers to securely accept and process payments, while also providing valuable data-driven insights and driving our guest engagement programs. We maintain competitive and clear pricing, our systems are in compliance with PCI Security Council standards, and our hardware supports EMV and NFC payment technology.
•Toast Capital: Toast Capital offers restaurants fast and flexible funding via loans advanced by our bank partner that are repaid with interest through a daily holdback of credit card receipts. We are uniquely positioned to offer capital to our restaurants using patented systems for loan origination that incorporate data science models, historical point of sale data, and payment processing volume, and have created a straightforward process that can deliver urgently needed funds as soon as the next business day.
•Purchase Financing: We also offer a number of ways for customers to finance the upfront cost of Toast products, often one of the largest barriers to switching to or purchasing a new POS system. Our programs include 0% interest financing for investments made in Toast products. The flexibility we offer has had a measurable impact on our rapid location growth.
Platform and Insights
•Reporting and Analytics: Our differentiated software and financial technology ecosystem underpins our data collection and analytics capabilities, providing insights and reporting on real-time sales, menu, and labor data, and allowing our customers to analyze their results and improve performance over time. Our cloud-based reporting enables access to performance data regardless of physical location, and our automatic nightly email sends key business metrics directly to our customers, sharing the critical daily insights they need to successfully operate their business. We estimate that on any given day, approximately two-thirds of Toast locations engage with reporting in their restaurant dashboard.
•Toast Partner Connect and APIs: Toast’s partner ecosystem allows our customers to customize their technology stack to meet their business needs, choosing from a curated portfolio of approximately 160 partners that deliver a broad spectrum of specialized solutions ranging from accounting to waitlists. Toast Partner Connect is a portal within Toast that allows customers to discover, select, and seamlessly connect their restaurant to our partners. Our suite of bi-directional application programming interfaces, or APIs, connects our partners to our workflows and data, and also allows our customers to connect custom applications and software to our ecosystem.
Our Technology
We empower our customers to take control of their operations by utilizing our proprietary technology that spans across our products. Each of our products is built on Toast’s shared platform infrastructure and services. This platform layer provides common capabilities and reusable components, allowing a streamlined, integrated customer experience to be built efficiently by our independent teams.
Our digital technology platform includes:
Software, cloud-based services, and partner ecosystem
•Reliable cloud services. Our highly scalable, services-based, multi-tenant architecture runs on Amazon Web Services.
•Offline POS capabilities. In the event of an internet or network disruption, Toast’s offline POS capabilities provide essential continuity of operations. This capability allows customers to continue to place orders, print tickets and receipts, and take credit card payments. In this offline mode, all credit card information is securely encrypted and stored on the Toast device until it regains connection.
•Partner APIs. Toast has curated a portfolio of approximately 160 restaurant technology partners that utilize Toast APIs to deliver a broad range of specialized solutions.
Payments
Toast provides fast and secure, integrated payment processing through its POS devices, standalone contactless reader, or Toast Tap, and online ordering applications.
•Security and compliance. Toast is a PCI-DSS Level 1 service provider and PA-DSS validated payments application. All card processing systems adhere to strict PCI security policies and procedures.
•Reliability. We leverage our extensive on-the-ground experience to provide a reliable payments experience that is resilient to issues with restaurants’ networks or internet service providers as well as Toast’s own cloud platform.
•Flexible omni-channel capabilities. Toast provides in-store, digital, and partner payment capabilities. In-store payments through the Toast integrated card reader and Toast Tap support card dipping, tapping, and swiping as well as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, with fraud detection capabilities to minimize transaction risks. Using Toast-provided payments across channels simplifies our customers’ experience, providing them with a single daily deposit of funds and consolidated reporting for easier accounting.
Hardware
•Full-service hardware to power all operations. Toast offers a unique line of purpose-built, restaurant-grade hardware, including POS terminals, handheld devices, kitchen display screens, card readers, guest display devices, printers, and networking equipment.
•User-friendly, durable, and designed to last. Our custom-designed hardware is pre-configured to enable self-installation with limited support and is created to be spill- and drop-proof with a long battery life to withstand the rigors of the restaurant environment.
•Device management. Our hardware utilizes the open-source Android mobile operating system which enables us to freely distribute the operating system to the Toast terminal and handheld devices. Proprietary management tools allow Toast to safely and efficiently upgrade POS software and device firmware as well as to monitor the health of devices across the fleet.
Our Growth Strategy
Our strategy is to continue to invest in areas that align with our customers’ needs. We expect that both we and our customers will continue to realize the value of our network as we continue to grow in scale, make enhancements to our technology, offer more products and services, and help restaurants increase revenue while saving time and money. Toast both drives and benefits from the success of our customers—when restaurants grow, Toast grows through higher payments volume and increased adoption of our full platform.

•Fuel efficient location growth with both new and existing customers. Despite our rapid growth and scale, we estimate that our current locations account for only about 7% of restaurants in the United States. We also expect that new restaurants that open in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic will seek innovative and end-to-end technology solutions to manage their operations. We therefore believe there is a substantial opportunity to grow our location footprint. To that end, we intend to invest in our field-based go-to-market engine, customer success through a combination of tailored onboarding services, customer support, and intuitive product design, as well as research and development of new products to continue to meet the industry’s evolving needs. We also expect to continue to see significant location growth among our existing customers, both as they open new locations and as we continue to roll out the Toast platform to more of our customers’ existing locations.
•Increase adoption of our full suite of products. We believe that we are well-positioned to sell additional products to our existing customers through a combination of sales and marketing efforts and product-led growth. We believe our all-in-one, integrated platform approach is well-suited to a customer base that has historically struggled to adopt technology at the same pace as other industries due to a lack of dedicated information technology resources.
•Invest in and expand our product platform. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to expand the functionality of our current platform and to broaden the subscription services and financial technology solutions we offer. We believe our proven track record and continued strategy to build products that directly address key pain points for our stakeholders will differentiate us and help grow our addressable market. We also believe we have an opportunity to expand the ways in which we leverage the data on our platform to help our customers succeed.
•Further develop our partner ecosystem. Toast’s integrated SaaS platform currently connects customers to approximately 160 partners, providing our customers with the tools and features they need to run their business. Today, we have partnerships in place across a spectrum of solutions that include employee management, reservations, inventory, accounting, security, analytics, marketing and customer relationship management, loyalty, mobile pay, gift cards, online ordering, and digital signage. We intend to continue expanding our technology and channel partnerships to deliver even more value to our customers and increase the strategic nature of our platform. 
•Selectively pursue inorganic growth. We intend to selectively explore inorganic product and technology growth opportunities to build out our portfolio and strengthen our ecosystem advantage. We believe that the scale of our partner ecosystem provides additional visibility into what products would be most valuable to our stakeholders. For example, in July 2019, we announced the acquisition of StratEx to simplify and optimize payroll, one of a restaurant’s largest single expenses, while leveraging our existing capabilities in timeclock and attendance. Additionally, in June 2021, we announced the acquisition of xtraCHEF to enable our customers to improve operational efficiency and financial decision-making through restaurant-specific invoice management software that helps track and record expenses.
•Expand internationally. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand usage of our platform outside of the United States. We have recently made an initial investment to establishing our international presence. This growth strategy will be a long journey and we are in the very early stages of expansion. We intend to add international sales team members to address this market opportunity alongside targeted research and development efforts based on local market dynamics.
Customer Success
Our customer success team supports our customers through their entire lifecycle beginning with onboarding and extending to ongoing customer care, including product enablement and education around industry best practices. We invest in scalable and efficient onboarding solutions that offer a differentiated customer experience. We currently offer on-site, remote, and self-guided implementation options to our customers. To better serve the growing sophistication of our customers and improve the upfront cost burden, we launched a remote onboarding offering in 2019. We have since scaled remote installations to represent the majority of our onboarding efforts.
We offer multi-channel customer support 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year via chat, phone, or web. We built our entire platform to be cloud-based, so our customer success team can provide seamless support remotely. Due to the all-in-one nature of our platform, we offer restaurants a single point of contact for any issues across their entire technology stack. We invest significantly in customer support and consider these investments to be a key competitive differentiator.
Sales and Marketing
The restaurant industry is a local industry. Restaurant operators purchase everything from food and alcohol to equipment and table linens from individuals that they know and trust. Our sales and marketing motion is designed from the ground up to integrate into this dynamic by combining a high-volume marketing engine with a localized and consultative sales force.
We start with in-market sales teams that are deeply familiar with, and trusted by, the local community. This deep knowledge of the local food and beverage scene provides us with a competitive advantage. Our sales team is organized by three main functional areas: an acquisition team that is focused on new location growth and organized by restaurant size, an upsell team that focuses on our customer community, and a growth team focused on sales enablement and operations.
To generate and capture demand we invest heavily in the primary discovery channels for restaurant operators. We combine our demand generation efforts with pricing and packaging that is designed to increase platform adoption and simplify the buying process for restaurants. This approach provides multiple entry points into the Toast platform ranging from a single terminal point of sale to a multi-product setup for a complex restaurant.
As Toast continues to grow, so does the importance of brand recognition and our investments into strengthening it. This brand recognition will help continue to drive growth in the restaurant community and increase referrals.
Research and Development
Our product development strategy is based on typical inputs such as market and user research, routine strategy planning, and iterative financial analysis, but it is first and foremost based around our customer obsession and mission of empowering the restaurant community to delight guests, do what they love, and thrive. We believe strongly that this customer obsession and innovation on their behalf is the best long-term product strategy to help our customers outperform, and this strategy drives both the products we build and the partnerships we create within the restaurant ecosystem.
We organize our team with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science, and design. We develop our products in four primary research and development locations: Boston, Chicago, Chennai, and Dublin. Each location has a combination of product management, user experience design, software engineering, and quality assurance personnel. 
Competition
The market is competitive and evolving rapidly. Our platform combines functionality from numerous product categories, and we therefore compete in each of these categories: cloud-based point of sale platforms, legacy point of sale platform payments solutions; and point technology providers with products addressing specific front of house or back of house operations. We compete on the basis of a number of factors including: 
•the ability to provide an all-in-one software and financial technology platform specifically designed to meet the existing and future technology needs of prospective customers, including comprehensive partner ecosystem integrations; 
•product performance, flexibility, durability, ease of use, security, scalability, and reliability; 
•brand recognition, reputation, and customer satisfaction; 
•the availability and quality of support and other professional services, including the ability to onboard prospective customers in a timely and cost-efficient manner; 
•the ability to operate and support all geographic markets specified by the prospective customer; and 
•the ability to integrate systems seamlessly and at low costs to provide important data insights.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new market entrants, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
Seasonality
We experience seasonality in our financial technology solutions revenue, which is largely driven by the level of gross payment volume, or GPV, processed through our platform. For example, customers typically have greater sales during the warmer months, though this effect varies regionally. As a result, our financial technology solutions revenue per location has historically been stronger in the second and third quarters. We believe that financial technology solutions revenue from both existing and potential future products will continue to represent a significant proportion of our overall revenue mix, and seasonality will continue to impact our results of operations.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 3,172 employees. We also engage consultants as needed to support our business and operations from time to time.
Core to our success is our passionate and diverse team of Toasters, led by a skilled and experienced leadership team with a proven track record of scaling leading platforms and organizations. With approximately two-thirds of our employees having previous work experience in the restaurant industry, we are truly driven by a love for amazing food, a love for delightful experiences, and a love for the diverse community that restaurants represent. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Toast, we power successful restaurants of all sizes. The restaurant industry is one of the most diverse industries and we embrace that diversity by encouraging it within our company. We believe that the success of our business comes only with the success of all our employees. 
We bake inclusive principles into our design, build cultural competence and equity in our practices, and ensure opportunities for growth and rewards by investing in developing our managers and employees through a number of live, in-person and self-directed programs.
We offer a number of specialized Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI, programs and initiatives to equip Toasters with the tools necessary to develop and promote an environment of inclusion and respect that leads to better engagement, productivity, and innovation. These include individual and peer DEI coaching focused on targeted conversations and specific development; DEI programs that build awareness and mitigate bias offered live and as e-learning modules; and specific development for our managers and leaders designed to enable them to build more meaningful and authentic relationships with their teams and create a more inclusive workplace environment. 
Our Toasters are directly involved in maintaining an inclusive and equitable culture through our Toast Communities and our Council of Advocates for Equity, which leverage their combined perspectives to advocate for an equitable experience for all, across our business strategy and company culture. 
Social Commitment
At Toast, we are committed to supporting causes that solve critical food issues and enrich the food experience for all. Driven by our commitment to local communities, in 2019 we launched a philanthropic branch, Toast.org, dedicated to solving critical food issues that impact communities across the United States. In furtherance of Toast’s values and these goals, we have joined the Pledge 1% movement. As a part of this initiative, our Board of Directors reserved 5,468,890 shares of Class A common stock that we may issue over a period of ten years in ten equal annual installments as a bona fide gift to a charitable organization to fund its social impact initiatives through Toast.org. 
Employee Safety during COVID-19
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our Toasters with three guiding principles: (1) protect the health and safety of our Toasters and their families; (2) deliver on our mission to help the restaurant industry thrive; and (3) trust in the data and guidance from the scientific and medical communities as they work to inform and protect our society. Since March 2020, the majority of our employees have worked from home. For Toasters who must work on-site, we have undertaken a full suite of enhanced safety measures, including social distancing, masking, testing, and enhanced cleaning protocols. We will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and maintain a safe and productive work environment for our employees. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business.
We have also developed a patent program and a strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our platform and technology. As of December 31, 2021, we have 39 U.S. patent applications allowed/granted, and in addition we have 41 U.S. patent applications pending. Our issued patents are estimated to expire between 2034 and 2039. Such expiration dates may vary based on a variety of factors, including benefit claims, term adjustments, and/or extensions as well as the timely payment of maintenance fees. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.toasttab.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. See the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the section(s) titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a description of the risks related to our intellectual property.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business and service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. As more fully described below, certain of our services also are, or may be in the future, subject to the laws, rules, and regulations that are related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, payments services (such as payment processing and settlement services), including laws concerning consumer financial protection, anti-money laundering and escheatment. From time to time, we may launch pilot programs or early-stage products, which may subject us to additional state or federal laws or regulations. We also are, or may be in the future, subject to rules promulgated and enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States, including federal, state and local agencies, payment card networks and other authorities, and internationally. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations, and rules frequently change and are increasing in number.
BSA and FinCEN Regulation
Certain of our payment technology solutions are or may become subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the BSA. The BSA requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services business, or MSBs (such as money transmitters), to register with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, as MSBs and to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records, among other things.
Our subsidiary, Toast Processing Services LLC, or TPS, is registered as an MSB with FinCEN in its capacity as a money transmitter. As an MSB, we are required to maintain a written anti-money laundering program, or AML Program, that meets the standards set forth in the FinCEN regulations implementing the BSA. In addition, our AML Program is designed to address and comply with the Money Laundering Control Act and other U.S. laws and regulations regarding anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, which we refer to as AML/CFT, and to control for the AML/CFT risks inherent to our business. The AML Program is also designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate business with certain individuals, entities, countries, and territories that are targets of economic or trade sanctions, including those imposed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
State Licensing Requirements
Certain of our payment technology solutions are or may become subject to state money transmitter or payroll processor laws and regulations. TPS is licensed as a money transmitter in most states and is seeking licenses to operate as a money transmitter in connection with its payroll processing activities in certain other states. Federal and state money transmitter laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on us, including anti-money laundering program requirements; record-keeping requirements; disclosure requirements; examination requirements; annual or biennial activity reporting and license renewal requirements; notification and approval requirements for changes in our officers, directors, stock ownership or corporate control; permissible investment requirements; capital or minimum net worth requirements; bonding; restrictions on marketing and advertising; qualified individual requirements; anti-money laundering and compliance program requirements; data security and privacy requirements; and review requirements for customer-facing documents.
Card Network and NACHA Rules
We rely on our relationships with financial institutions and third-party payment processors to access the payment card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, which enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, and our ability to explore and offer certain other products. We pay fees to such financial institutions and third-party payment processors for such services. We are required by these third-party payment processors to register with Visa, Mastercard, and other card networks and to comply with the rules and the requirements of these card networks’ self-regulatory organizations. The payment networks and their member financial institutions routinely update, generally expand, and modify requirements applicable to our customers, including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships, merchant chargeback standards and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. PCI DSS is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect cardholder data.
We are also subject to the operating rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or NACHA. NACHA is a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions, such as audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations.
State Loan Disclosure Requirements and Other Substantive Lending Regulations
Loans facilitated by Toast Capital are subject to state laws and regulations that impose requirements related to commercial loans, including loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, and credit reporting. State advertising, loan brokering, loan servicing, and debt collection laws may apply to the marketing and loan administration services we provide to our bank partner that makes the loans facilitated by Toast Capital.
FTC Act and Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforces Section 5 of the FTC Act against non-banks and has a history of pursuing enforcement actions for alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the marketing or servicing of financial products and services that are marketed to consumers or small businesses. The FTC has jurisdiction over us and our business practices.
Privacy and Consumer Information Security
In the ordinary course of our business, we access, collect, store, use, transmit and otherwise process certain types of data, including personally identifiable information, or PII, which subjects us to certain federal and state privacy and information security laws, rules, industry standards and regulations designed to regulate consumer information and data privacy, security and protection, and mitigate identity theft. These laws, some of which are discussed below, impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use, transfer, retention and disclosure of PII, and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their PII and disclosure of it to third parties. Such laws and regulations are subject to ongoing changes, and a number of new proposed or recently-passed laws or regulations in this area are expected to be applicable to our business.
In addition, under these laws and regulations, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and Regulation P promulgated thereunder, we must disclose our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of nonpublic personal information with third parties. The GLBA may restrict the purposes for which we may use PII obtained from consumers and third parties. We may also be required to provide an opt-out from certain sharing.
On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, took effect, directly impacting our California business operations and indirectly impacting our operations nationwide. While personal information that we process that is subject to the GLBA is exempt from the CCPA, the CCPA regulates other personal information that we collect and process. A new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was passed in November 2020. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information.
