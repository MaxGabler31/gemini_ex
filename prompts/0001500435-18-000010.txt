Item 1. Business
Overview
GoPro is enabling the way people capture and share their lives from a perspective only achieved with a GoPro. What began as an idea to help athletes document themselves engaged in sport, GoPro has become a mobile storytelling solution that helps the world share itself through immersive content. To date, our cameras and mountable and wearable accessories have generated substantially all of our revenue. We sell our products globally through retailers, wholesale distributors, and on our website. 
Our product offerings include the following:

• | HERO5 and HERO6 are our cloud-connected line of cameras launched in Fall 2016 and Fall 2017, respectively, featuring image stabilization, telemetry, cloud connectivity and voice control. Our HERO6 Black camera is powered by GoPro's custom-designed GP1 processor and is the most powerful and performance featured GoPro camera to date. We offer many professional-grade features with our current good-better-best camera offerings, which includes our HERO5 Session, HERO5 Black and HERO6 Black cameras, respectively. These cameras feature automatic uploading capabilities for photos and videos to GoPro Plus, our premium cloud-based storage solution.


• | Fusion is our waterproof spherical camera which captures a 360-degree perspective and launched in November 2017. Using our GoPro App on iOS, a mobile user can view live preview shots, stitch, trim and share content directly from their mobile device. Using the mobile OverCapture feature allows the iOS user to re-frame and save traditional fixed-perspective videos “punched out” or extracted from a 360-degree video source file.


• | GoPro Plus is a cloud-based storage solution that enables subscribers to easily access, edit and share content. Beginning in 2018, the subscription service also includes camera replacement. Our HERO5 and HERO6 cameras can automatically upload new photos and videos to a subscriber’s GoPro Plus cloud account.


• | Quik is our primary mobile editing app that makes it simple to create stunning edits on a smartphone. Our Quik desktop app provides expanded editing options for power users.


• | GoPro App is a mobile app that allows users to preview and play back photos and videos, control their GoPro cameras and share content on the fly using their smartphones. Included in the GoPro App is GoPro

4

QuikStories, a mobile experience that seamlessly copies a user's GoPro photos and video clips to his or her smartphone and transforms them into a ready-to-share video. GoPro QuikStories makes it simple to automatically create shareable video edits complete with music, effects and transitions.

• | Karma Grip is a handheld or body-mountable camera stabilizer that makes it easy to capture zero-shake, smooth video.


• | Karma Drone is our foldable drone and stabilization solution, which will be discontinued in 2018 after we sell our remaining inventory.

We also offer a full ecosystem of mountable and wearable accessories. See Products below for additional information. 
We believe our investments in hardware, cloud and mobile solutions have yielded a solid foundational experience for consumers that we will continue to build upon in 2018. 
Our strategy 
Helping our consumers capture and share experiences is at the core of our business. We are committed to developing solutions that create an easy, seamless experience for consumers to capture, create and enjoy engaging personal content. When consumers use our products and services, they often generate content that organically increases awareness for GoPro, driving a virtuous cycle and a self-reinforcing demand for our products. We believe revenue growth will be driven by the introduction of new cameras, accessories, software applications, subscription offerings and value-driven pricing. We believe new camera features drive a replacement cycle among existing users and attract new users, expanding our total addressable market. Key components of our 2018 strategy and beyond include the following: 
Drive profitability through improved efficiency, lower costs and better execution. We incurred material operating losses in 2017 and 2016 and our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our operating expenses effectively. In 2017 and 2016, we implemented company-wide restructurings of our business resulting in global reductions-in-force, the elimination of several high-cost initiatives (including the closure of our entertainment group and our exit from the aerial market) and the consolidation of certain leased office facilities around the globe in order to improve efficiencies, lower costs and focus our resources on our hardware and software integrated storytelling solution. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below for information regarding restructuring charges in 2017 and 2016.) The actions taken reduced our 2017 operating expenses by $286.9 million from 2016 and we expect the actions will further reduce our operating expenses in 2018 when compared to 2017.
Strengthen our analytics and understanding of customer behavior to enable better business planning. To better manage and improve the predictability of our business, GoPro will commit more resources to generating and triangulating data on consumer behavior. We believe improved data analytics could help us design better products and services with a pricing strategy that provides the best value for our consumers.
Launch products that broaden GoPro’s appeal at all price points, with greater emphasis on new customers. Our data shows that once consumers enter GoPro’s product ecosystem, many become repeat purchasers, upgrading to our newest products with enhanced features or purchasing other products at compelling price points. In an effort to attract new consumers into the ecosystem, we plan to design and market easy-to-use products and services that will appeal directly to entry-level consumers and help them upgrade to other GoPro products. 
Increase our investment in marketing to grow our brand and attract new customers globally. In 2018, GoPro will focus its marketing investments on the biggest opportunities for capturing a larger market and growing category share in digital imaging. Our marketing strategy will include more support for entry and mid-level products that attract new consumers and introduce them to GoPro’s good-better-best product strategy. We also plan to tightly align marketing investment to create awareness and better capitalize on the launches of new products and services as well as through key sales events. We believe that international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity for GoPro. Revenue from outside the United States comprised 55%, 53% and 52% of our revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe our continued investments in innovative and easy-to-use cameras, localization of voice and contextual language, and intuitive and simple 
5

software tools and services, will enable us to expand our user base to a broader group of international consumers. We plan to increase our presence globally through the active promotion of our brand, the creation and cultivation of regional strategic and marketing partnerships, the expansion of localized products in international markets with region specific marketing, and an investment focus on the biggest opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Focus on our ecosystem of camera, app and cloud experiences. Our strategy is to make the smartphone central to the GoPro experience, eliminating the pain points involved in managing content, and producing and sharing immersive experiences. Our cloud-connected HERO5 and HERO6 cameras, GoPro Plus service and apps work together to enable an ecosystem that allows users to capture, edit and share those experiences on a mobile device and easily back-up the content in the cloud. We believe HERO5 and HERO6’s auto-upload and voice control features provide game-changing experiences for consumers that we intend to continue to build upon with our next-generation cameras. Our Quik editing app and GoPro App enable users to quickly produce high-quality videos that are fun to create and easy to share across multiple platforms. We expect to continue to enhance our software and services offerings, including solutions that automate editing on-the-go and improve and simplify content transfer from GoPro cameras to mobile devices. We remain focused on making the smartphone a key component in the GoPro user experience.
Expand the value proposition of our subscription offerings to attract new consumers and engage our global user base.  GoPro’s subscription service, Plus, was launched in 2016 and offered cloud storage, expanded editing solutions and more. Since then, Plus has become a quiet success attracting more than 130,000 paying subscribers. In February 2018, we relaunched Plus to include camera replacement, mobile upload, expanded cloud storage for videos and unlimited storage for photos. With significantly enhanced offerings and marketing support, we aim to grow our subscription business in 2018 by attracting new users and more deeply engaging our large consumer base.
Another priority for growing our business is to attract, engage and retain top talent. In every area of our company, we want employees committed to growing GoPro through great ideas and innovation. We plan to do this by leveraging our strong brand recognition, unique culture, competitive compensation and benefits as well as our strong commitment to our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging initiative. GoPro’s culture has been central to our ability to attract top talent. We hope to maintain this with events and programs that engage our people such as Opportunity Lab which offers workshops on topics such as public speaking and career growth. Similarly, our Live It initiative encourages employees to dedicate time each week to use GoPro products, and produce and share photos and videos of their experiences. Competitive compensation, growth opportunities, engaging programs and fun are essential elements of GoPro’s employment brand. 
In addition to the key components of our 2018 strategy and beyond, we will seek to leverage our brand strength and product expertise to drive a hardware upgrade cycle for our users, opportunistically enter complementary new device categories and continue to develop spherical-capture/virtual reality products. With our robust ecosystem of mounts and accessories, GoPro products allow our users to live the moment they wish to capture without having to step outside of that moment to capture it.
Products 
Cameras. We offer a good-better-best camera line-up that includes the cloud connected HERO5 Session, HERO5 Black and HERO6 Black cameras. We also offer Fusion, our new 360-degree spherical camera. HERO5 Session, HERO5 Black, HERO6 Black and Fusion cameras are waterproof (without a housing), come with select mounting accessories, and have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth providing connectivity with a mobile device to enable remote control, content viewing, editing and sharing functionality. Our HERO5 Black and HERO6 Black cameras can shoot in 4K at 30 and 60 frames per second, respectively, and Fusion shoots in 5.2K at 30 frames per second in 360-degrees. All of our current cameras feature multi-language voice control, electronic image stabilization, simplified controls, and the ability to auto-upload photos and videos to our cloud subscription solution, GoPro Plus, via Wi-Fi for easy access and editing with our apps. HERO5 Black, HERO6 Black and Fusion also feature GPS and additional sensors that capture location, elevation, speed and G-force loads. 
Mounts and accessories.  We offer a wide range of mounts and accessories, either bundled with a camera or 
6

sold separately, that enhance the functionality and versatility of our products, and enable our consumers to capture their experiences during a variety of activities or moments, and from different viewpoints. Our equipment-based mounts, include helmet, handlebar, roll bar and tripod mounts. Our 3-way mount is a 3-in-1 mount that can be used as a camera grip, extension arm or tripod, and our floating mounts such as the Handler, and Bite mounts + Floaty, allow our cameras to float in water. We also enable consumers to wear mounts on their bodies with the use of our wrist housing, chest harness and head strap. Additionally, we offer spare batteries, charging accessories and cables to connect our GoPro cameras to television monitors, flotation devices, dive filters and anti-fogging solutions. Our accessories expand the features, versatility and convenience of our cameras. 
Applications.  We offer mobile and desktop applications to all consumers at no charge that help our users manage, edit, view and share their content. Our GoPro App allows users to preview and play back shots, control their GoPro and download and share content on the fly using their smartphones. With the Quik mobile app, users can automatically create and share videos from their smartphone content or from their GoPro Plus account. With QuikStories, content transforms into a seamless video automatically, utilizing machine learning and computer vision to pick and frame the footage. Quik for desktop automatically imports content from a GoPro camera and makes it simple for users to create awe-inspiring videos synced to music with just a few clicks of the mouse. Our GoPro App allows users to preview and play back shots, control their GoPro camera and share content on the fly using their smartphones. The GoPro VR app allows users to explore exciting virtual reality experiences on their smartphone.
Services. GoPro Plus is a cloud-based subscription service that offers a range of premium benefits to our consumers, including camera replacement, easy auto-upload from a GoPro camera to the cloud for on-the-go access, editing and sharing using a smartphone and the Quik app, an expanded library of soundtracks, premium support, and exclusive discounts on mounts and accessories. We had approximately 130,000 paying subscribers as of January 31, 2018. GoPro Care is a fee-based service that offers a range of support options to our consumers, including extended warranty and accidental damage coverage. Revenue earned to date from GoPro Plus and GoPro Care was not material to our results in 2017.
Image stabilization. The Karma Grip, which we offer as a standalone accessory, is a handheld, body-mountable 3-axis camera stabilizer that makes it easy to capture zero-shake, smooth video.
Drone. The Karma drone features a compact design that fits in a small backpack, and the drone is flown using a game-style controller with an integrated touch display. The Karma drone will be phased out in 2018. We will continue to service and support Karma drones over the next several years.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced our highest levels of revenue in the fourth quarter of the year, coinciding with the holiday shopping season, particularly in the United States and Europe. While we have implemented operational changes aimed at reducing the impact of fourth quarter seasonality, on full year performance, timely and effective product introductions, marketing and forecasting, whether just prior to the holiday season or otherwise, are critical to our operations and financial performance. 
Segment information and geographic data
We operate as one reportable segment. Financial information about geographic areas is presented in Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Backlog
We do not believe that backlog information is material or meaningful as of any particular date or indicative of future sales, as our customers can change or cancel orders with limited or no penalty and limited advance notice prior to shipment.
Research and development
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products that inspire our consumers and enhance our brand. We are constantly innovating to deliver better performance, expanded functionality and increased convenience to enhance the appeal of our products. Our software application development focuses on convenient 
7

and seamless content management, editing and sharing. We strive to remain a market leader by consistently introducing innovative products, software and services that offer optimal performance at affordable price points.
We have a user experience-driven approach to product development and our CEO leads product design. By engaging with customers, consumers and opinion leaders in our core markets around the world, our development team strives to introduce meaningful and empowering new features that expand the versatility and performance of our products. We also benefit from input received from our in-house production team, our sponsored athletes and our brand advocates that regularly travel the world capturing content using our products. We believe leveraging this input will help refine our existing products and influence future products that give us a competitive advantage.
The engineering team supports the development of cameras, related mounts and accessories, firmware and software. The hardware engineering team is responsible for developing technologies to support the concepts developed by our product team. These core technologies include GoPro's custom designed GP1 processor, which allows cameras to perform advanced image computation and provides unparalleled image quality and next-level image stabilization, new image silicon processors, image sensors and lenses, as well as the core algorithms that enable the systems to operate and provide optimal performance and features. The hardware engineering team also integrates these innovations and firmware into our product designs and develops our cameras, mounts and accessories. 
The software engineering team develops applications that enhance the functionality of our products and facilitate the management, editing, sharing and viewing of content. These applications are being developed for mobile, desktop and web-based platforms, and powered by server-side services. The core technologies include rendering engines to enable video editing, video encoding and decoding for smooth playback and algorithms for moment identification.
Our research and development expenses were $229.3 million, $358.9 million and $241.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment
Our products are designed and developed in the United States, France, China and Romania, and a significant majority of our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers located in China, Japan and Malaysia. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. Our strategic commodities team manages the pricing and supply of the key components of our cameras, including digital signal processors, sensors and lenses. Several key strategic parts are purchased from suppliers by us and then consigned to our manufacturers, while the vast majority of parts are procured directly by our contract manufacturers. We seek to use our commodities team to achieve competitive pricing on the largest value-add components and leverage our contract manufacturers’ volume purchases for best pricing on common parts.
We have third-party fulfillment centers in California, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore that deliver our products from multiple locations worldwide. These facilities are either warehouse/fulfillment centers or full-service postponement centers (that perform light assembly in addition to warehouse/fulfillment). In addition, we have third-party centers in California and China that perform in-region final packaging services. Cameras and drones are typically air freighted while accessories and packaging are generally regionally procured or shipped via ocean freighter from our manufacturers to these fulfillment centers, where the products are packaged for retail sale. Our fulfillment strategy allows us to reduce shipping costs, reduce custom levies, customize products for local languages and improve inventory flexibility.
Sales channels and customers 
We offer our products in over 30,000 retail outlets and in over 100 countries through our direct sales channel and indirectly through our distribution channel. In 2017 and 2016, our direct sales accounted for 54% and 55% of our revenue, respectively, and our distributors accounted for 46% and 45% of our revenue, respectively.
Direct sales
We sell directly to most of our retailers in the United States, some of our retailers in Europe and directly to consumers around the world through our e-commerce channels, as described below. 
8

Independent specialty retailers. We use a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products to independent specialty retailers in the United States focused on sports and consumer activity capture markets. Our representatives provide highly personalized service to these retailers, including in-store merchandising, taking orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about GoPro products and services. We also have an internal, regionally focused sales team that provides a secondary level of service to both the independent specialty retailers and manufacturer representatives. Independent specialty retailers generally carry our higher end products, targeting their core customers who we believe tend to be early adopters of new technologies. Independent specialty retailers outside of the United States represent a similarly important sales channel for us, and we reach these customers indirectly through our network of international distributors.
Big box retailers. We sell to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Inc., Target Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. We support these retailers with a dedicated and experienced sales management team that we believe enables us to reduce channel conflict.
Mid-market retailers.  We also sell to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing, and motor sports. In the U.S., we sell directly to these mid-market retailers through our experienced sales teams assigned to particular accounts and regions. 
e-commerce channel.  We sell our full line of products to consumers around the world through our online store at gopro.com, which we market through online and offline advertising. Sales through gopro.com were less than 10% of our total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Distribution
We sell to over 55 distributors who resell our products to retailers in international markets and to certain specific verticals in the United States. We have dedicated sales personnel focused on providing a high level of service to these distributors, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, development of marketing materials, order assistance and educating the distributors’ sales personnel about GoPro products. 
In-store merchandising 
Our in-store merchandising strategy focuses on our iconic GoPro-branded, video-enabled point of purchase (POP) merchandising displays that are located in nearly all retail outlets where our products are sold. These displays showcase GoPro videos and present our product ecosystem in a customer-friendly manner. Our larger retailers help us represent a broader range of GoPro products due to their in-store deployment of our larger and custom POP displays. We have been successful working with our retailers to further expand the footprint of our POP displays within existing stores. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 29,000 POP displays in retail outlets worldwide.
Marketing and advertising 
Our marketing and advertising programs are focused on engaging consumers by exposing them to compelling GoPro content and educating them about new hardware features as well as the power of our solutions for software editing (Quik mobile and desktop) and content management (GoPro Plus). We believe this approach enhances our brand while demonstrating the performance, durability and versatility of our products. Our marketing and advertising efforts span a wide range of consumer interests and leverage both traditional consumer marketing and lifestyle marketing strategies. 
Consumer marketing.  Social media plays an important role in our consumer marketing strategy. Our consumers capture and share personal GoPro content on social media and content sharing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Vimeo and YouTube. GoPro content was viewed approximately 700 million times on social media platforms in 2017, up more than 25% year-over-year. In 2017, we gained almost 4.8 million new followers to our social accounts for a lifetime total of 35 million followers. Of the 4.8 million new followers on our social accounts, 3 million were on Instagram, resulting in a lifetime total of 15 million on Instagram. Our total Instagram followers reached 15 million at the end of 2017. To date, we have reached 1.8 billion views on YouTube. We also integrate user-generated content and GoPro originally produced content into advertising campaigns across various platforms including television, print, online, billboards and other out of home 
9

advertising, and at consumer and trade facing events. This content also supports our in-store channel marketing efforts, appearing on our POP displays and other in-store marketing materials. We continue to believe GoPro content remains a significant asset that builds awareness for our brand and products. 
Lifestyle marketing. Our lifestyle marketing programs focus on expanding GoPro brand awareness by engaging consumers through relationships with key influencers, event promotions and other outreach efforts. We cultivate strong relationships with influential athletes, celebrities, entertainers and brands, all of whom use our products to create and share engaging content with their own fans and consumers. We also work directly with these partners to create compelling content that we leverage to our mutual benefit across the GoPro Network, a collection of GoPro Channels hosted on a variety of online destinations and partner platforms.
Competition
The market for cameras is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include quality, reliability and user experience, price and performance, design innovation, brand recognition, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and brand reputation.
We compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc., Fujifilm Corporation, Nikon Corporation, Olympus Corporation and Vivitar Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as, Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corporation and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd. We believe we compete favorably with these companies’ products. Our durable and versatile product design facilitates increased functionality and wearability and we offer a variety of mounts and other accessories that enable a wide range of consumer use cases that are difficult for other competing products to address. Further, we offer many professional-grade features within our camera and spherical product offerings at attractive consumer price points, including our superview mode, which allows a user to capture an immersive wide-angle perspective, super high-resolution video capability, voice control features, image stabilization, and OverCapture, which allows a Fusion user to capture content from every angle. We also provide users with a suite of free mobile and desktop applications that enhance the overall GoPro experience. Moreover, we believe we have achieved significant brand recognition in our target vertical markets. We believe our years of experience working with active and influential consumers contributes to our ability to develop attractive products and establishes the authenticity of our brand, thereby differentiating us from current and potential competitors. 
Smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional camera sales, and the makers of those devices also have mobile and other content editing applications and storage for content captured with those devices. Our Quik mobile and desktop editing applications, our GoPro App and our GoPro Plus service may not be as compelling a solution as those offered by other companies, such as Apple, Inc. and Google, although the Quik mobile application supports content from other platforms including content from Apple and Android. Also, it is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of such devices, such as Apple, Google and Samsung, may continue to design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products with features similar to ours. In addition, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products directly in our category.

Intellectual property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and our practice is to seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. Our trademarks, including “GOPRO,” “HERO,” “SESSION,” and “KARMA,” and the GoPro logos, among others, are a critical component of the value of our business. In addition, we hold many issued and pending utility and design patents for innovations that help our consumers capture, create and share their content using our cameras, drones, mounts, accessories and software. Our patents cover areas that include physical structures, image processing, operational firmware and software, post-processing software, distribution software, mount and accessory structures, as well as the ornamental aspects of our hardware and software products. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 369 issued patents and 441 patent applications pending in the United States, and 229 corresponding issued patents and 153 patent applications pending in foreign countries. Our issued U.S. patents will expire approximately between 2024 and 2036 and our issued foreign patents will expire approximately between 2022 and 2042. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. We continually review our development efforts to assess our innovations, including their patentability. We take active measures to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party use, including misuse of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights.
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections in agreements with employees, contract manufacturers, distributors and others. Despite these protections, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any nondisclosure agreements with us, or independently developing products that are similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,273 employees. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In January 2018, we implemented a company-wide restructuring of our business resulting in a global reduction in force to reduce our employee headcount below 1,000 employees by the end of 2018.
Corporate and available information
We were incorporated as Woodman Labs, Inc. in California and began doing business as GoPro in February 2004. We reincorporated in Delaware in December 2011 and in February 2014 we changed our name to GoPro, Inc.
