ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Weyland Techs CreateApp platform, offered as a Platform as a Service (PaaS), enables small-medium-sized businesses ("SMB") to create a mobile application ("app") without the need of technical knowledge, high investment or background in IT. At present, the Company does not charge for use of the PaaS platform. The Company recognizes revenue on a pay to use subscription basis when our customers use our platform.

We believe that SMB can increase sales, reach more customers and promote their products and services via a simple easy to build mobile app at an affordable price and in a cost-effective manner.

Our corporate headquarters are located at 85 Broad Street, 16-079 New York, NY 10004. Although we maintain a website at www.weyland-tech.com, we do not intend the information available on our website be incorporated into this filing.

Our Strategy

Although Weyland Tech's CreateApp platform originally focused on the Pan-Asia marketsthe platform is provided in twelve, predominantly Asian, languageswe have partners that work with us to develop the EU and North American markets. 

The CreateApp platform enables SMB to create a mobile application ("app") without the need of technical knowledge, high investment or background in IT.

We believe that through our app, SMB can increase sales, reach more customers and promote their products and services via a simple easy to build mobile app at an affordable price and in a cost-effective manner.

Weyland Tech currently offers the CreateApp platform directly, as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) in the following key markets:

Singapore: www.createappsingapore.com

India (Jaipur): www.aapkiapp.in

US/Canada: www.createappamericas.com

Weyland Tech currently offers a DIY App builder through a 'white label' platform, also under a PaaS model, with the apps developed generating revenue in the following markets, primarily via cooperation agreements that were structured in late 2015, 2016 and 2017:




EU, via a Strategic Cooperation with Augicom S.A. (www.augicom.ch)




Malaysia, via a Cooperation Agreement with Silver Ridge Tangerine Sdn Bhd (www.silverridge.com.my)




Hong Kong and South China via a Cooperation Agreement with Info Zone Development Ltd. 




Indonesia, via a Cooperation Agreement with DPEX Worldwide (www.dpex.com)



North America, via a Cooperation Agreement with Aurum Digital Inc. (www.createappamericas.com)




Thailand via a Cooperation Agreement with BGT Corporation Public Company Limited (http://www.bgtech.co.th/)




The Philippines via a Cooperation Agreement with MocaApp (www.mocaapp.com) 




France via a Cooperation Agreement with Orange Pro (https://pro.orange.fr/)

For the territories licensed to our distributors and on a white label basis, we derive royalty income from the end user use of our platform. 

SMB

The Company believes that these agreements will create a large enough addressable market opportunity to generate sales and profits in a scalable manner, grow the Company's business and enhance shareholder value.

Given the nature of DIY mobile apps ("apps"), and the primary target market of SMB, a typical go-to-market strategy would have a direct sales force or resellers approach SMB directly to drive our revenue.

Over the past two years, the Company has evolved our Platform as a service model with three distinct market paths to drive recurring revenue business model.

A) Cooperation agreements in countries/regions where our partners are responsible for targeting SMB either through an installed base of customers or groups of Direct Sellers with a sales force encompassing SMB as end customers.

B) Enterprise Solutions where large retailers (hypermarket chains, mall owners, brand owners with company-owned and franchise stores) adopt a 'Master App' on a white-label basis, hosted at a 3rd party regional Hosting or Data Center facility.

C) Digital Wallet or e-Wallet: a digital financial services business, a distinguishing characteristic of Greater South East Asia (GSEA) compared to the United States is the substantially lower percentage of the population with bank accounts, credit cards, or debit cards. This creates the need for alternative payment methods, specifically e-wallets. GSEA is poised for its own payments transformation in much the same way that China has shifted to online payments, according to IDC. Online payments in GSEA is divided into four broad payment modes: e-wallets, such as our AtoZPay platform, credit cards, debit cards and online banking. Of these, the e-wallet mode is expected to grow the fastest over the next five years, according to IDC. Drivers for GSEAs e-wallet industry include the mismatch between internet penetration and banking penetration, which creates a structural opportunity for e-wallets; the increasing integration of e-wallets with use cases such as online games and e-commerce; and the opportunity to offer broader digital financial services using e-wallets as a foundation.

With the above strategy, we believe that the Company has been able to maintain a lower capital expenditure base due to the 'level-two' customer support vs. 'level-one' customer support, smaller sales and marketing teams, and the need to provide hosting services.

The Companys CreateApp Platform operates as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) allowing users to develop their own applications supplying the infrastructure and IT services, which users can access

anywhere via a web or desktop browser. The Company recognizes revenue on a pay to use subscription basis when our customers use our platform. 

We do not compensate resellers and distributors, instead the end user pays the reseller/distributor directly as well as paying for our services, for which we or our reseller/distributor in licensed territories bill the end user separately.

Growth of the Mobile Apps Industry

We believe that there are a number of factors that are contributing to the continued growth of the mobile apps industry: (i) smartphone adoption continues to increase globally; (ii) lower purchase prices of smartphones for consumers; (iii) smartphone users are becoming increasingly comfortable with the process of searching for and conducting business on their phones; (iv) SMB are placing more emphasis on implementing a mobile app versus a mobile website to enable customers to gain a higher level of interaction and functionality; and (v) internet users in emerging markets use smartphones as their primary internet access device, having bypassed the desktop PC entirely. We believe that the Company will be able to participate in the growth of the mobile apps industry by offering an affordable, easy to build and use platform.
Competition

Our business is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our current and potential competitors include:

Each of the online game, e-commerce and e-wallet industries in GSEA is highly fragmented. We face competition in each of our lines of business in each market where we operate. Some of our competitors, particularly those based outside of GSEA, may have greater access to capital markets, more financial and other resources, and a longer operating history than we do.
Online Games

We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including user base, game portfolio, quality of user experience, brand awareness and reputation, relationships with game developers and access to distribution and payment channels. Our competitors primarily include companies with a presence in just one or a few markets in the region.
E-commerce

We face competition principally from regional players that operate across several markets in the region. We also face competition from single-market players in the region. We compete to attract, engage and retain buyers based on the variety and value of products and services listed on our marketplaces, overall user experience and convenience, online communication tools, integration with mobile and networking applications and tools, quality of mobile applications, and availability of payment settlement and logistics services. We also compete to attract and retain sellers based on the number and engagement of buyers, the effectiveness and value of the marketing services we offer, commission rates and the usefulness of the services we provide including data and analytics for potential buyer targeting, cloud computing services and the availability of support services including payment settlement and logistics services.
E-wallet Platforms

AtoZPay competes primarily with credit card and debit card service providers, banks with payment processing offerings, other offline payment options and other electronic payment system operators. AtoZPay competes with these companies primarily on the basis of transaction processing speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, reliability and price. We believe the combination of

AtoZPays numerous physical service counters and the AtoZPay App is a significant competitive advantage because of the strong demand in GSEA for convenient forms of payment processing.

Our business is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) Advertising companies, Web design firms and more recently, mobile app makers; (2) other DIY mobile app companies; (3) a number of indirect competitors, including media companies, web portals, comparison shopping websites, and web search engines, either directly or in collaboration with SMB; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website/app development.; (5) companies that provide infrastructure web and mobile services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our mobile apps business include ease of use, affordability and broad range of functionality. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, slightly longer histories, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, functionality and ease of use and marketing. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.
