 We were founded in June 1996 by a team at Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), led by our chairman, Donald B. Murray, who was then a senior partner with Deloitte. Our founders created the Company to capitalize on the increasing demand for high quality outsourced professional services. We operated as a part of Deloitte until April 1999. In April 1999, we completed a management-led buyout. In December 2000, we completed our initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. We currently trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RECN. We operate under the acronym RGP, the branding for our operating entity name of Resources Global Professionals. 
 Our business model combines the client service orientation and commitment to quality from our legacy as part of a Big Four accounting firm with the entrepreneurial culture of an innovative, agile and dynamic company. We are positioned to take advantage of what we believe are two continuing trends in the marketplace: constant change driving the need for agile, specialized talent in our global client base and a growing innovative talent pool interested in working in a non-traditional professional environment. We believe our business model allows us to simultaneously offer challenging yet flexible career opportunities to attract well qualified, experienced professionals and to attract clients with enterprise-wide, global consulting needs. 
 As of May 26, 2018, we employed or contracted with 3,247 consultants serving a diverse base of over 2,400 clients ranging from large multinational corporations to mid-sized companies to small entrepreneurial entities, in a broad range of industries. Our consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas and most have advanced professional degrees or designations. We offer our consultants careers that combine the flexibility of project-based consulting work with exposure to quality clients who are executing impactful, important work.

 Our offices serve our multinational clients throughout the world with a client focus rather than from just a regional/office perspective. To enhance our ability to serve multinational clients, we served our clients from 48 offices in the United States and from 26 offices within 21 countries abroad as of May 26, 2018. 
 Revenue from the Companys major geographic areas was as follows (in thousands): 
 

 | Revenue for theYears Ended | | | | | % of Total
 | May 26,2018 | | May 27,2017 | | | %Change | May 26,2018 | | May 27,2017 |

 See Note 15  Segment Information and Enterprise Reporting  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Companys domestic and international operations and Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors  Our ability to serve clients internationally is integral to our strategy and our international activities expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face for information regarding the risks attendant to our international operations. 
 We believe our distinctive culture is a valuable asset and is, in large part, due to our management team, which has extensive experience in the professional services industry. Most of our senior management have Big Four, management consulting and/or Fortune 500 experience and an equity interest in the Company. This team has created a culture of professionalism and a client service orientation that we believe fosters in our consultants a feeling of personal responsibility for, and pride in, client projects and enables us to deliver high-quality service and results to our clients. 
 Industry Background 
 Changing Market for Project- or Initiative-Based Professional Services 
 RGPs services respond to a growing marketplace trend: namely, corporate clients are increasingly choosing to plan for their workforce needs in more flexible ways. We believe the growing trend in the future of work will be project-based and not role based. Permanent headcount is being reduced as clients purposely engage agile talent for project initiatives and transformation work. 
 While the market for professional services is broad and fragmented and independent data on the size of the market is not readily available, we believe companies may be more willing to choose alternatives to permanent headcount and traditional professional service providers because of evolving economic competitive pressure and continuing compliance with increases in government-led regulatory requirements. We believe RGP is positioned as a viable alternative to traditional accounting, consulting and law firms in numerous instances because, by using project consultants, companies can: 

 | Strategically access specialized skills, expertise for projects of set duration
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Move quickly
--+-------------


 | Blend independent and fresh points of view
--+-------------------------------------------


 | Effectively supplement internal resources
--+------------------------------------------


 | Increase labor flexibility
--+---------------------------


 | Reduce their overall hiring, training and termination costs
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 Typically, companies use a variety of alternatives to fill their project needs. Companies outsource entire projects to consulting firms, which provides them access to the expertise of the firm but often entails significant cost and less management control of the project. Companies also supplement their internal resources with employees from the Big Four accounting firms or other 
 
2 


  traditional professional services firms. Companies use temporary employees from traditional and Internet-based staffing firms, although these employees may be less experienced or less qualified than employees from professional services firms. Finally, some companies rely solely on their own employees who may lack the requisite time, experience or skills. 
 Supply of Project Consultants 
 Based on discussions with our consultants, we believe the number of professionals seeking to work on an agile basis has historically increased due to a desire for: 

 | More flexible hours and work arrangements, coupled with a professional culture that offers competitive wages and benefits
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The ability to learn and contribute in different environments
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | Challenging engagements that advance their careers, develop their skills and add to their experience base
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A work environment that provides a diversity of, and more control over, client engagements
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Alternate employment opportunities in regions throughout the world
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 The employment alternatives available to professionals may fulfill some, but not all, of an individuals career objectives. A professional working for a Big Four firm or a consulting firm may receive challenging assignments and training, but may encounter a career path with less choice and less flexible hours, extensive travel and limited control over work engagements. Alternatively, a professional who works as an independent contractor faces the ongoing task of sourcing assignments and significant administrative burdens, including potential tax and legal issues. 
 Resources Global Professionals Solution 
 We believe RGP is positioned to capitalize on the confluence of the industry trends described above. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, that RGP provides the agility companies desire in todays competitive and quickly evolving environment. We are able to combine all of the following: 

 | A relationship-oriented and collaborative approach with our clients
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Client service teams with Big Four, consulting and/or industry backgrounds to assess our clients project needs and customize solutions to meet those needs
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Highly qualified consultants with the requisite expertise, experience and points of view
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Competitive rates on an hourly, rather than project, basis
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Significant client control of their projects with effective knowledge transfer and change management
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resources Global Professionals Strategy 
 Our Business Strategy 
 We are dedicated to serving our clients with highly qualified and experienced talent in support of projects and initiatives in a broad array of functional areas, including accounting; finance; governance, risk and compliance management; corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring; information management; human capital; supply chain management; and legal and regulatory. Our objective is to build RGPs reputation as the premier provider of agile consulting services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. We have developed the following business strategies to achieve our objectives: 

 | Hire and retain highly qualified, experienced consultants. We believe our highly qualified, experienced consultants provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. Therefore, one of our priorities is to continue to attract and retain high-caliber consultants who are committed to solving problems. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified professionals by providing challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing professional development and learning opportunities, while offering flexible work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Maintain our distinctive culture. Our corporate culture is the foundation of our business strategy and we believe it has been a significant component of our success. Our senior management, virtually all of whom are Big Four, management consulting and/or Fortune 500 alumni, has created a culture that combines the commitment to quality and the client service focus of a Big Four firm with the entrepreneurial energy of an innovative, high-growth company. Our culture continues to evolve to meet the new challenges facing consultants, clients and management and so our original acronym TIEL (talent, integrity, enthusiasm and loyalty), representing the traits expected of our people, has evolved. In todays marketplace, we believe that focus and accountability are key traits that help to strengthen our team and support our ability to provide clients with high-quality services and solutions. Thus, our culture has evolved to LIFE AT RGP, representing Loyalty, Integrity, Focus, Enthusiasm, Accountability and Talent. We believe our culture has created a circle of quality; our culture is instrumental to our success in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees who, in turn, attract quality clients. 
 

 | Build consultative relationships with clients. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. We believe the professional services experience of our management and consultants enables us to understand the needs of our clients and deliver an integrated, relationship-based approach to meeting those needs. Client relationships and needs are addressed from a client, not office, perspective. We regularly meet with our existing and prospective clients to understand their business issues and help them define their project needs. Once our revenue team helps define the clients project needs, our talent team identifies consultants with the appropriate skills and experience to meet the clients objectives. We believe that by establishing relationships with our clients to solve their professional services needs, we are more likely to identify new opportunities to serve them. The strength and depth of our client relationships is demonstrated by two key statistics: 1) during fiscal 2018, 48 of our 50 largest clients engaged our consultants in more than one practice area and 45 of those top 50 clients used three or more practice areas; and 2) 45 of our largest 50 clients in fiscal 2013 remained clients in fiscal 2018 while 37 of our top 50 clients in 2008 were still clients in 2018. In addition, during fiscal 2018 our top 50 clients were served by an average of six RGP offices, demonstrating the breadth of our relationships with clients world-wide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Build the RGP brand. Our objective is to build RGPs reputation as the premier provider of agile consulting services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. Our primary means of building our brand is by consistently providing high-quality, value-added services to our clients. We have also focused on building a significant referral network through our 3,247 consultants and 906 management and administrative employees working from offices in 21 countries as of May 26, 2018. In addition, we have global, regional and local marketing efforts that reinforce the RGP brand.

Our Growth Strategy 
 Since inception, our growth has been primarily organic rather than via acquisition. We believe we have significant opportunity for continued organic growth in our core business as the global economy strengthens and economic uncertainties decrease and, in addition that we can grow opportunistically through strategic acquisitions. In both our core and acquired businesses, key elements of our growth strategy include: 

 | Expanding work from existing clients. A principal component of our strategy is to secure additional work from the clients we have served. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, the amount of revenue we currently receive from many of our clients represents a relatively small percentage of the amount they spend on professional services, and, consistent with historic industry trends, they may continue to increase the amount they spend on these services as the global economy evolves. We believe that by continuing to deliver high-quality services and by further developing our relationships with our clients, we can capture a significantly larger share of our clients expenditures for professional services. Near the end of fiscal 2017, we launched our Strategic Client Program to serve a number of our largest clients with dedicated global account teams. We believe this focus enhances our opportunity to develop in-depth knowledge of these clients needs and the ability to increase the scope and size of projects with those clients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Growing our client base. We will continue to focus on attracting new clients. We strive to develop new client relationships primarily by leveraging the significant contact networks of our management and consultants and through referrals from existing clients. We believe we can continue to attract new clients by building our brand name and reputation, supplemented by our global, regional and local marketing efforts. We anticipate our growth efforts this year will focus on identifying strategic target accounts especially in the large and middle market client segments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Expanding geographically. We have expanded geographically to meet the demand for agile professional services around the world and currently have offices in 21 countries. We believe, based upon our clients requests, there are future opportunities to promote growth globally. Consequently, we intend to continue to expand our international presence on a strategic and opportunistic basis. We may also add to our existing domestic office network when our existing clients have a need or if there is a significant new client opportunity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strategic acquisitions. Since fiscal 2009, we have grown organically; as we had not identified a target acquisition that fit one of our primary acquisition goals: either addressing an identified gap in our geographic presence or in our solution offerings. In fiscal 2018, we identified and acquired two entities, taskforce, Management on Demand AG (taskforce) and substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Accretive Solutions, Inc. (Accretive). The acquisition of taskforce and Accretive satisfied the need to better penetrate the vibrant economic market in Germany and gaps in serving middle market companies in the United States, respectively, while also harmonizing well with RGPs culture.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Providing additional professional service offerings. We will continue to develop and consider entry into new professional service offerings. Since our founding, we have diversified our professional service offerings from a primary focus on accounting and finance to other areas in which our clients have significant needs such as human capital; information management; governance, risk and compliance; supply chain management; legal and regulatory services; and corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services. In fiscal 2017, we formed our Integrated Solutions group to identify project opportunities that we can market at an enterprise level with talent, tools and methodologies. This group commercializes projects into solution offerings. Currently, our solutions practice is focused on Transaction Services and Analytics and Technical Accounting Services. When evaluating new solutions offerings to market, we consider (among other things) cultural fit, growth potential, profitability, cross-marketing opportunities and competition.

Consultants 
 We believe an important component of our success has been our highly qualified and experienced consultants. As of May 26, 2018, we employed or contracted with 3,247 consultants engaged with clients. Our consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas. We provide our consultants with challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing professional development and learning opportunities, while offering more choice concerning work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements. 
 Almost all of our consultants in the United States are employees of RGP. We typically pay each consultant an hourly rate for each consulting hour worked and for certain administrative time and overtime premiums, and offer benefits, including: paid time off and holidays; a discretionary bonus program; group medical and dental programs, each with an approximate 30-50% contribution by the consultant; a basic term life insurance program; a 401(k) retirement plan with a discretionary company match; and professional development and career training. Typically, a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of these benefits. In addition, we offer our consultants the ability to participate in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which enables them to purchase shares of the Companys stock at a discount. We intend to maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs. To a much lesser extent, we utilize a bench model for consultants with specialized in-demand skills and experience. These consultants are paid a weekly salary rather than for each consulting hour worked and have bonus eligibility based upon utilization. 
 Internationally, our consultants are a blend of employees and independent contractors. Independent contractor arrangements are more common abroad than in the United States due to the labor laws, tax regulations and customs of the international markets we serve. A few international practices also utilize the partial bench model described above. 
 Clients 
 We provide our services and solutions to a diverse client base in a broad range of industries. In fiscal 2018, we served over 2,400 clients from offices located in 21 countries. Our revenues are not concentrated with any particular client or within any 
 
5 


  particular industry. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the years ended May 26, 2018, May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, and in fiscal 2018, our 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 15% of our revenues. 
 The clients listed below are representative of the multinational and industry diversity of our client base: 
 

Aetna Inc. | Citigroup 
American Express Company | Kaiser Permanente 
BASF Corporation | MetLife, Inc. 
Bayer U.S. LLC | New York Life 
Caesars Entertainment Corporation | Phillips 66 Company
Calumet Specialty Products Partners | Signify 

Services and Products 
 RGPs business model and operating philosophy are rooted in the support of client-led projects and consulting initiatives, extending to advisory-based services that leverage the deep experience and expertise of our internal team while partnering with our clients business leaders. Often, we deliver our services to clients across multiple functional areas of expertise with consultants from several disciplines working on the same project. Our areas of core competency include: finance and accounting; information management; human capital; corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services; legal and regulatory; governance, risk and compliance; and supply chain management. 
Finance & Accounting 
 RGPs Finance and Accounting services encompass accounting operations, financial reporting, internal controls, financial analyses and business transactions.

We provide specialized skills and then transfer knowledge to clients in order to help them leverage their own personnel. RGP specializes in providing customized solutions to our clients most pressing business problems, through project management and providing access to full project teams for a specific initiative. Our scalability, consultant quality and global reach also put us in the ideal position to help organizations manage peak workload periods or add specific skill sets to ongoing client projects.

 Sample Engagement  Lease Accounting Compliance: Challenged with assessing and developing an implementation solution to the requirements posed by the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), our client, a multi-national leader in food processing and marketing, sought the assistance of RGP consultants. Specifically, acting as project managers, out consultants helped: 
 

 | Perform an assessment of lease data, including the process to gather, validate and cleanse lease data
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Provide direction on needed change management and business process transformation
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Utilize our proprietary tool, policyIQ, to design a process to capture lease updates and modifications

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sample Engagement  Revenue Recognition Compliance: Our client, a multi-billion dollar Fortune 500 provider of insurance services, needed a partner to navigate through the unique and complex requirements of the FASBs revenue recognition guidance, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and subsequently issued amendments (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606). Using RGPs proprietary tools designed for revenue recognition projects, four RGP consultants teamed with the clients employees and provided technical expertise to: 
 

 | Review several billion dollars in revenue streams
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | Analyze the best method of adoption based on the clients unique circumstances
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Create whitepapers, develop financial statement disclosures and lead discussions with external auditors
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sample Engagement  Acquisition Readiness: A publicly traded provider of water treatment solutions embarked on a series of acquisitions and determined that it needed to improve its ability to integrate current and future acquisitions. Using our cache of integration processes and tools, six RGP consultants identified improvement opportunities to key challenges, leading to the development of a customized master integration plan and playbook to support future transactions. Our consultants also coached the clients newly formed integration management office to ensure understanding of recommendations and set the stage for future integration activities. 
 Sample Engagement  Cross-practice area M&A Joint Venture Assessment and Integration Execution: A large U.S. based manufacturing company engaged RGP to execute a 50/50 joint venture with another manufacturer. Using RGPs proprietary M&A integration framework, our team of 22 consultants helped the client through integration planning, execution and transformation. RGP set up the Integration Management Office (IMO) to provide the client with program and project management, change management, synergy management, and reporting/metrics. Functioning as an extension of the company, RGPs team provided the following services, which serve as a rigorous example of the cross-discipline functionality between our practice areas: 

 | Supported the integration execution across all functional areas of the company, including:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | IT  Integration Lead, Applications, Infrastructure
--+----------------------------------------------------

 Countsy 
 RGPs Countsy practice provides outsourced accounting, finance and human resource services. These services are geared towards privately owned venture backed companies in the early years of their life cycle, typically in the technology or life sciences space. Countsy puts an accounting infrastructure and business process in place that allows these companies to have an efficient, compliant back office that maintains the books in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and produces the financials and metrics the management team needs to run the business. These companies need to be due diligence and acquisition ready at all times and the goal of the Countsy service is to ensure that is the case. The Countsy service typically starts with helping to organize clients with a seamless accounting and human resources (HR) function, incorporating a platform of SaaS tools such as NetSuite, Bill.com and Dropbox. We provide a defined business process alongside an outsourced accounting team to operate the back office. The client engagement team from Countsy is responsible for all aspects of the accounting and HR function, from transactional activity such as running payroll and vendor payment through the month end close cycle and production of financial statements. Countsy assigns a fractional outsourced CFO to all clients to manage the account and to provide strategic financial advisory services. 
 Countsys core competencies include: 
 

Accounting Infrastructure  Countsy implements a platform of SaaS tools: NetSuite (ERP) Bill.com (vendor bill pay) Dropbox (file storage) Expensify (employee expense reports) Financial Reporting and Analysis  Investor reporting  Internal management reporting  Account and transaction-level analysis  Budget versus actual reporting | Transactional Support  Accounts payable  Accounts receivable  Payroll processing  Employee expense reimbursement  General ledger  Balance sheet reconciliations  Month end close  HR support CFO Services  Policies and procedures  Planning, budgeting and modeling  Key performance indicators  New accounting standards implementation  Fund raising support  Debt negotiations  Board meeting preparation and support 

 Sample Engagement  Start up Services Leading to Successful Transition to Internal Team: Countsy engaged with a venture backed start up in the health supplement industry shortly after the company incorporated. For the first three years of the companys life, Countsy provided accounting infrastructure including an accounting and HR support team and a consultant with CFO skills, all fueled by use of our tools such as NetSuite, Dropbox, Bill.com and Expensify. The company scaled rapidly with Countsys infrastructure supporting the increase in transactions and complexity as the company successfully launched its product line to multiple major retailers. As the company grew, management began to build an internal accounting team, including a Controller. With daily work transitioning, Countsy continued to support with high-level CFO advisory work, helping the company evaluate equity versus debt options to fund their growth and assisting in the diligence process for follow on fund raising events.

 Sample Engagement  Start up Services Leading to Successful Acquisition: Countsy engaged with a venture backed start up in the cancer drug discovery field after an initial round of funding. After initially serving as the ventures accounting and HR support team using our software tools, the company engaged us to implement a payroll system and a health benefit plan. The client also had a number of initiatives our CFO consultant focused on. The consultant helped develop a unique strategic plan, including an in-depth cash flow analysis encompassing multiple business scenarios over a multi-year span. In addition, as the volume of consumables purchased grew, the consultant helped select and implement a full requisitions system, complete with an internal control structure and approval matrix. 
 Over the next two years, Countsy continued to operate as the companys outsourced accounting and human resource function while providing extensive CFO level support to the CEO and founding team as they raised two additional rounds of preferred financing. Our consultant helped negotiate a debt facility for their increased capital needs and prepared extensive financial reporting while attending quarterly board meetings. 
 The client later received a lucrative offer to be acquired by a large public pharma entity. Countsy supported the diligence process and provided advice on the sale from the client side, while working with the clients law firm to populate a data room in support of the transaction. Post close, Countsy assisted in the hand-off of the CFO, accounting, finance and HR functions to the acquirer. This engagement spanned three years.

 Sample Engagement  Improvement in Financial Reporting Consolidation Through Use of Robotic Process Automation (RPA): A global multibillion-dollar provider of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools needed assistance in developing and implementing solutions to automate its financial reporting reconciliation process. RGP consultants from both finance and IM disciplines extracted data and analyzed the clients current reconciliation process and data sources to develop an understanding of potential targeted improvements. Through RPA, the RGP team automated 80% of the financial reporting reconciliation process, developing a virtual workforce to complete manual and repetitive tasks while improving accuracy through removing human error and positively impacting reporting metrics.

 Sample Engagement  Business Process Optimization: Our client, a global construction company, spent significant amounts of time on a manual intercompany service charging process that did not take advantage of the organizations SAP functionality. In six business days, two RGP consultants completed a current state review of the organizations processes and SAP system from a people, process and technology perspective. The review identified opportunities to both leverage SAPs functionality and adopt leading intercompany accounting practices. Ultimately, the team recommended four solutions, each customized to streamline and automate existing processes, tailored to more effectively use SAP. 
 Sample Engagement  Centralization of Data to Improve Decision Making: A multi-billion dollar technology company specializing in the global payments industry needed assistance in consolidating budget and forecast data from numerous international locations into a single database. Our team of consultants first analyzed the current budget and forecast processes and then developed a plan for the future standardized world-wide process. The project team then centralized the clients data into a single location using a proof of concept application. This provided the client with improved data validity, leveraged consistent metadata values, calculated global exchange rates and enabled enhanced reporting at all levels of the organization, improving both forecasting and the ability to make real-time decisions. 
 Sample Engagement  Identification of Significant Inefficiencies and Proposed Solutions: Our client, a large multinational consumer goods company, experienced significant monthly losses due to material waste. Our clients challenge was to find a way to identify areas of cost savings swiftly and effectively, with better data analytics. 
 RGP finance and data specialists, working with the clients IT team, analyzed operating conditions, and designed statistical models and dashboard reporting. As a result, the client now has a weekly view into its material inventory and can initiate stock transfers between factories so that excess material can be utilized where needed, avoiding potential costly write-offs. By identifying production costs across all factories, the client has quick insight into causes of variance and can take action in a timely manner. In addition, relevant factory teams can be held responsible and receive best practice training to improve efficiencies. Finally, the client can utilize the insights to make more efficient capital expenditure decisions for factories using outdated machinery. 
 Sample Engagement  Project Leadership for Global Next Generation Program: A Fortune 50 automotive company implemented a global program to create the next generation of connected vehicle technology and infotainment applications for all North American vehicle production. The RGP team leads the coordination and integration of a highly complex set of services that requires the seamless integration of six external suppliers and eight internal teams, to create a new customer facing registration portal, secure global network and real-time interfaces needed to enable the new services. 
 RGP consultants serve as technical program management across 13 defined work streams as well as a variety of internal systems integrations that span enterprise infrastructure. The project also includes systems implementation in the form of architecture support and complex systems integration across the 14 teams building the technology components. The RGP Program Manager has managed the transition from vendor selection to solutioning and engineering the services with the supplier and client teams. RGP continues to be the technical systems integrator for all program work streams and horizontal platforms.

Given the complexity, breadth and depth of the transformation, the client engaged a team of RGP consultants to create and deploy an end-to-end change management strategy, essential to achieving the programs goal of value creation. The responsible client team is transforming as well, by investing in technology and automation, better data governance, optimizing processes and centralizing and streamlining organizations. They have designed a transformation change management and program management strategy to enhance the realization of the transformation initiative. Phase II of the engagement will include implementation of all change management activities in partnership with the transformation program office. 
 Sample Engagement  Organizational Capability Assessment and Improvement: A food industry leader was looking to transform business operations in order to maintain its competitive industry position and fuel growth. RGP utilized change management practices, to assess individual skill competencies and organizational capabilities currently in place. Our approach focused on enabling organizational learning and development as a catalyst for change and cultural improvement. We took a business driven approach by defining actions aligned to corporate business strategy. Collaborative workshops promoted a shared vision of the future desired state, while gaining buy-in and ownership for a three year roadmap of planned initiatives. Executive participation enabled sponsorship for the transformation program, helping to ensure the expected results. 
 Sample Engagement  HRIS Module Implementation and Standardization: A private, online media group recently implemented ADP Workforce Now and wanted to integrate other HR modules into their payroll platform including time tracking, leave management and a self-service portal. In addition to an aggressive timeframe, our client was in the middle of major organizational changes including divesting a company, a merger and two acquisitions. As project manager, we were instrumental in delivering the project on-time, helping our client to fully utilize the system. We also created process standardization and streamlining, reduced transaction processing cost, increased the quality of HR data and produced more complex and comprehensive business metrics. Providing on-site project management and process optimization in this dynamic corporate environment was crucial to the success of the project. 
 Sample Engagement  Establishment of New Corporate Compensation Function: A fast-growing multi-national pharmaceutical company needed assistance in establishing a new corporate compensation function, addressing core infrastructure issues.

12 


 Sample Engagement  Search for Technical and Personality Skills Fit: Our client, a $40 million dollar integrated fleet services company, needed assistance in hiring a Vice President of Finance. The company had a very distinct, tight-knit culture with the previous executive team working together for over 20 years. RGPs challenge was to pull together an accurate personality and skill profile for the type of candidate who would fit in with the family-like environment and be a worthy addition to the team. We presented five qualified candidates, with one quickly emerging as the choice. 
 Sample Engagement  Search for Transformational Finance Executive: Our team recruited a Vice President of Finance for a high- growth startup company in the life sciences industry. The client needed a seasoned finance executive to take them to the next level, with the companys focus shifting from medical research to new product development. The candidates challenge was to help the company quickly deal with an anticipated increase in revenue of over 500%. Filling this role had become an urgent priority for our client and we were successful in presenting our top five candidates and facilitating the hiring process in a two-week period. 
 Sample Engagement  Search for Multiple IT Professionals: Our client, the IT organization of a global financial services company, needed to identify and on-board 40 professionals within four months. Due to significant organizational transformation, the client kicked-off a new program that required a large team of seasoned professionals including program directors, project managers, technical leads and business analysts to complete the peak demand of work over a two-year period. We worked with our client to develop a creative and cost-effective solution to meet their financial and information driven goals, successfully identifying and integrating candidates into the clients organization.

 At completion of the project, the client significantly decreased its outside legal spend and better positioned itself to manage the choice and deployment of internal and external legal resources. 
 Sample Engagement  Assistance with Critical Software Deployment: Our client, a significant developer and distributor of entertainment projects, implemented an online rights and contract management platform, to capture critical business and legal terms from contracts related to original production and development of new scripted and unscripted television and movie content. 
 RGP has been retained to provide advisory services to assist in putting together best practices, protocols, quality control, training, metrics and other tasks related to overall project management, as well as attorneys to provide substantive legal expertise by conducting the rights analysis of the contracts and capturing consistent and accurate data. The project is business criticalthe new system must ultimately be an effective tool that helps drive revenue, enforce compliance and mitigate risk. 
 Sample Engagement  Assessment to Mitigate Reputational Harm, Regulatory Exposure and Litigation Risk: The senior management of a global entity, which had grown rapidly via acquisition to over $2.5 billion in revenue and 100,000 employees, asked RGP to assist in the assessment of mitigation of potential reputational harm, regulatory exposure and litigation risk. In particular, management was concerned about their ability to ensure the security of sensitive financial and personal information for customers, tracking of its contractual commitments, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. The goal was to assess risk, protect from reputational harm, mitigate against regulatory exposure and litigation and communicate to its clients that the company is a trusted business partner and world-class organization. 
 RGP was selected to create and conduct a compliance risk assessment. Using the work of RGP consultants, the assessment positioned our client to present the following to the companys board of directors: 
 

 | The companys compliance-related obligations from both regulatory and contractual perspectives
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Compliance obligations from a people, process and technology perspective, including the companys method for identifying risks and process to comply, report and resolve incidents
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Gaps between company obligations, its current compliance and recommendations to bridge the identified gaps
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The companys current compliance infrastructure and the structure and skills needed for compliance on a global basis
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sample Engagement  Law Department Organizational Design: The new general counsel for a multi-billion dollar energy and specialty refining company asked RGP to redesign its legal department structure from the ground up. A series of acquisitions, coupled with a more complex business environment, increased the departments work flows. Our consultants conducted extensive stakeholder interviews and an analysis of department operations to develop an organizational model stressing business continuity, best practices in organizational design, areas of process and resourcing improvement, and organizational development. RGPs solution resulted in a leaner legal team that leverages effective and efficient legal services providers, while implementing in-house efficiencies and automation.

 Sample Engagement  Negotiation, Monitoring and Supervision of Construction Projects: Our client, a Fortune 1000 technology company, has multiple priorities in procurement and design of internal construction projects. Working with the clients personnel, RGP consultants oversaw the negotiation and implementation of construction/redesign projects at the clients corporate headquarters. The clients primary concerns were: design consistency with the companys culture, operating within a set budget, and on-time completion of the various projects. 
 RGP provided procurement personnel to work closely with our clients counterparts to negotiate, monitor, and supervise construction projects. In addition, RGP consultants provided budget management for the clients procurement department and an advisory/quality assurance lead. The client lacked procurement expertise and construction/real estate sourcing knowledge. RGP built a detailed timeline collaborating with the client and their commercial real estate company. Our consultants negotiated project costs leveraging future growth opportunities, especially with subcontractor firms, reviewed quotes, researched benchmarks and imposed cost structure across the clients organization. In addition, RGP worked with the clients legal department to negotiate and document contract parameters. Ultimately, the client estimates it was able to achieve a 6.5% cost savings.

 Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC): Corporate Governance, Risk Management, Internal Audit and Compliance Services 
 RGPs GRC practice assists clients with a variety of governance, risk management, internal audit and compliance initiatives. The professionals in our GRC practice have experience in operations, controllership and internal and external audit and serve our clients in any number of roles required  from program manager to team member. In addition to helping clients worldwide in the areas of audit, risk and compliance, we are able to draw on RGPs other practice areas to bring the required business expertise to the engagement.

 Sample Engagement  Multiple Sarbanes and Internal Audit Support Services: For ten years, RGP consultants have provided our client, a multi-billion dollar publicly traded financial institution, service in internal audit, providing specialty audits, advisory services and annual Sarbanes testing. Specifically, we support the client in the following areas: 

 | Financial and IT Sarbanes Testing Support: consultants test the execution of key financial and IT controls within various areas of the client, and thus determine that the controls are functioning as intended. Potential deficiencies are communicated as identified.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internal Controls/Walkthrough Support: RGP provides senior/manager level audit professionals with risk and control backgrounds to assist the clients operational risk delivery function with various walkthroughs related to its evaluation of operational controls in connection with the execution of required Sarbanes process walkthroughs, testing and assessments.

 | Regulation AB Testing: The client requires assistance with the annual testing of its compliance to various government required regulations, including Regulation AB (related to asset-backed securities), USAP (Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers), HUD, Ginnie Mae and quarterly Regulation AB self-testing.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sample Engagement  Global Internal Audit & Internal Controls Delivery: A global technology leader decided to outsource its internal controls testing and co-source its internal audit needs, engaging RGP on a multi-year co-sourcing and advisory contract. During the transition phase, RGP created a core delivery team of experts and set up a dedicated, offshored testing/audit center. 
 For internal audit, RGP carries out internal audits on behalf of the client, following the clients specific audit methodology. Deploying consultants from our offices in cities where our client has operations, RGP adds local knowledge and skills to the clients fieldwork. To fully integrate the methodology, RGP created customized onboarding and training. 
 For internal controls testing, the client leverages RGP in a cost-efficient manner versus developing its own larger internal audit team. In addition, by leveraging industry best practices in control and finance compliance audits, RGP provides our client 
 
16 


  with better insights into more efficient ways of working and control. The client further leverages cost control by having RGP consultants perform a large portion of independent (local) testing to reduce time and budget of the external auditor. 
 Sample Engagement  Documentation and Enhancement of Internal Controls: A rapidly growing maker of automation software needed an assessment of current state business processes and internal controls at its U.S. and India operations for Sarbanes and general business purposes. Our consultants documented current state of internal controls, made recommendations for enhanced future state of controls and presented our findings to executive management. The assessments identified a significant number of high risk items of which the client was unaware, with actionable recommendations for improvement. 
 policyIQ 
 RGPs policyIQ is our proprietary cloud-based GRC software application, enabling the focused management of a wide range of GRC processes, including Risk Assessments, Sarbanes Compliance, Policy and Procedure Management, Internal Audit Programs, Anti-Corruption Compliance and Contract Administration. policyIQ can be implemented quickly to manage a specific aspect of an overall GRC program, or easily scaled to integrate multiple initiatives, allowing the organization to realize greater efficiency. In addition, our engagement teams often utilize policyIQ as a tool to assist in the efficient collection, storing and review of project workpapers, deliverables and other critical project content. Business problems our clients have used policyIQ to resolve include: 
 

 | Sarbanes Compliance Management: Clients use policyIQ to manage their entire Sarbanes compliance program, from risk assessment through remediation tracking. Electronic forms automate quarterly certifications, and reporting allows all stakeholders insight into the status of Sarbanes compliance at any time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Policy and Procedure Management: With policyIQ as the central location for all organizational policies and procedures, all employees have access to the most current documentation  and using electronic forms, can easily document annual proof of compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internal Audit Programs: Companies use policyIQ to capture workpapers electronically, gathering all evidence in a central location and assigning testing to the appropriate auditors. With robust reporting, audit managers have oversight into the process and with built-in workflow, audits can flow through appropriate channels of approval.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Contract Management: policyIQ provides a central, secure location to house all contract documentation, allowing companies to index contracts for ease of searching and align view, edit and approve security appropriately.

Operations 
 We generally provide our professional services to clients at a local level, with the oversight of our regional vice presidents and consultation of our corporate management team. The vice presidents and client development directors in each market are responsible for initiating client relationships, ensuring client satisfaction throughout engagements, coordinating services for clients on a national and international platform and maintaining client relationships post-engagement. Throughout this process, the corporate management team and regional vice presidents are available to consult with the vice presidents with respect to client services. Market revenue leadership and their teams identify, develop and close new and existing client opportunities, often working in a coordinated effort with other markets on multi-national/multi-location proposals. 
 Market revenue leadership works closely with our regionalized talent management team, who are responsible for identifying, hiring and cultivating a sustainable relationship with seasoned professionals fitting the RGP profile of client needs. Our consultant recruiting efforts are regionally or nationally based, depending upon the skill set required; talent management handles both the identification and hiring of consultants specifically skilled to perform client projects as well as monitoring the satisfaction of consultants during and post-completion of assignments. Talent focuses on getting the right talent in the right place at the right time. 
 We believe a substantial portion of the buying decisions made by our clients are made on a local or regional basis and that our offices most often compete with other professional services providers on a local or regional basis. As the marketplace for 
 
17 


  professional services has evolved, we continue to believe our local market leaders are in the best position to understand the local and regional outsourced professional services market. However, the complexity of relationships with many of our multinational clients also dictates that in some circumstances a hybrid model, bringing the best of both locally driven relationships as well as global focus, is important for employee and client satisfaction. 
 For projects requiring intimate knowledge and thought leadership on particular client concerns, our integrated solutions group consists of individuals with requisite skills and tools to work with clients. 
 We believe our ability to deliver professional services successfully to clients is dependent on our leaders in the field working together as a collegial and collaborative team, often working jointly on client projects. To build a sense of team effort and increase camaraderie among our leaders, we have an incentive program for field personnel that awards annual bonuses based on specific agreed-to goals focused on the performance of the individual and potential reward tied to the performance of the Company. We also share across the Company the best and most effective practices of our highest achieving offices and use this as an introductory tool with new vice presidents and directors. New leadership also spend time in other markets, partnering with experienced sales and recruiting personnel to understand, among many skills, how best to serve current clients, expand our presence with prospects and identify and recruit highly qualified consultants. This allows the veteran leadership to share their success stories, foster the culture of the Company with new vice presidents and directors and review specific client and consultant development programs. We believe these team-based practices enable us to better serve clients who prefer a centrally organized service approach. 
 From our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California, we provide centralized administrative, marketing, finance, HR, IT, legal and real estate support. Our financial reporting is also centralized in our corporate service center. This center handles invoicing, accounts payable and collections, and administers HR services including employee compensation and benefits administration for North American offices. We also have a business support operations center in our Utrecht, Netherlands office to provide centralized finance, HR, IT, payroll and legal support to our European offices. We share our Salesforce software platform world-wide, providing a common database of identified opportunities, prospective new clients, and existing client proposals for additional projects. In addition, in North America, we have a corporate networked IT platform with centralized financial reporting capabilities and a front office client management system. These centralized functions minimize the administrative burdens on our office management and allow them to spend more time focused on client and consultant development. 
 Business Development 
 Our business development initiatives are composed of: 
 

 | local and global initiatives focused on existing clients and target companies
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | national and international targeting efforts focused on multinational companies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | brand marketing activities
--+---------------------------


 | national and local advertising and direct mail programs
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Our business development efforts are driven by the networking and sales efforts of our management. While local senior management focus on market-related activities, they are also part of the regional, national and international sales efforts, especially when the client is part of a multinational entity. In certain markets, sales efforts are also enhanced by management professionals focused solely on business development efforts on a market and national basis based on firm-wide and industry-focused initiatives. These business development professionals, teamed with the vice-presidents and client service teams, are responsible for initiating and fostering relationships with the senior management and decision makers of our targeted client companies. During fiscal 2018, we completed our implementation of software from Salesforce.com on a world-wide basis, to serve as a tool to enhance our local and worldwide business development efforts. 
 We believe our national marketing efforts have been effective in generating incremental revenues from existing clients and developing new client relationships. Our brand marketing initiatives help develop RGPs image in the markets we serve. Our brand is reinforced by our professionally designed website, print, and online advertising, direct marketing, seminars, initiative-oriented brochures, social media and public relations efforts. We believe our branding initiatives, coupled with our high-quality client service, help to differentiate us from our competitors and to establish RGP as a credible and reputable global professional services firm.

 Competition 
 We operate in a competitive, fragmented market and compete for clients and consultants with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. Our principal competitors include: 

 | consulting firms
--+-----------------


 | local, regional, national and international accounting and other traditional professional services firms
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | independent contractors
--+------------------------


 | traditional and Internet-based staffing firms
--+----------------------------------------------


 | the in-house or former in-house resources of our clients
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 We compete for clients on the basis of the quality of professionals, the knowledge base they possess, the timely availability of professionals with requisite skills, the scope and price of services, and the geographic reach of services. We believe our attractive value proposition, consisting of our highly qualified consultants, relationship-oriented approach and professional culture, enables us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Although we believe we compete favorably with our competitors, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do. 
 Employees
