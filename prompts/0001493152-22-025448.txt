Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel solutions for people suffering from acute cannabinoid intoxication (“ACI”) and substance addiction. Our lead product candidate, ANEB-001, is intended to rapidly reverse the negative effects of ACI within 1 hour of administration. The signs and symptoms of ACI range from profound sedation to anxiety and panic to psychosis with hallucinations. There is no approved medical treatment currently available to specifically alleviate the symptoms of ACI and we are not aware of any competing products that are further along in the development process than ANEB-001 in reversing the effects of THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Previous clinical trials conducted by a third party have shown that ANEB-001 is rapidly absorbed, well tolerated and when administered to obese subjects led to weight loss, an effect that is consistent with central CB1 antagonism. In March 2021, our European clinical trial application (“CTA”), which is equivalent to an investigational new drug application in the United States, was accepted in the Netherlands to allow us to utilize ANEB-001 in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial (the “Netherlands Trial”) for potential use as a treatment for ACI. The study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of a single dose of ANEB-001 in treating healthy subjects challenged with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC, the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis. We announced on January 3, 2022 that the first patient had been dosed in the Netherlands Trial. On May 11, 2022, we announced the dosing of all 60 subjects in Part A of the Netherlands Trial. On June 30, 2022, we received positive initial data from Part A of the Netherlands Trial, which we reported on July 5, 2022 in a press release. We believe the progress in the Netherlands Trial creates an opportunity to strengthen our development pathway.


ACI has become a widespread health issue in the United States, particularly in the increasing number of states that have legalized cannabis for medical and recreational use. The ingestion of large quantities of THC is a major cause of ACI. Excessive ingestion of THC via edible products such as candies and brownies, and intoxication from synthetic cannabinoids (also known as “synthetics,” “K2” or “spice”), are two leading causes of THC-related emergency room visits. Synthetic cannabinoids are analogous to fentanyl for opioids insofar as they are more potent at the cannabinoid receptor than their natural product congener THC.
 
In recent years, hospital emergency rooms across the United States have seen a dramatic increase in patient visits with cannabis-related conditions. Before the legalization of cannabis, an estimated 450,000 patients visited hospital emergency rooms annually for cannabis-related conditions. In 2014, this number more than doubled to an estimated 1.1 million patients, according to data published in “Trends and Related Factors of Cannabis-Associated Emergency Department Visits in the United States: 2006-2014,” Journal of Addiction Medicine (May/June 2019), which provided a national estimate analyzing data from The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (“NEDS”), the largest database of U.S. hospital-owned emergency department visits. Based on our own analysis of the most recent NEDS data, we believe that the number of hospitalizations grew to 1.74 million patients in 2018 and was growing at an approximately 15% compounded annual growth rate between 2012 and 2018. We believe the number of cannabis-related hospitalizations including other health problems associated with ACI such as depression, anxiety and mental disorders will continue to increase substantially as more states pass laws legalizing cannabis for medical or recreational use. Given the consequences, there is an urgent need for a treatment to rapidly reverse the symptoms of ACI.
 
Our Lead Product Candidate
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize new treatments options for patients suffering from ACI and substance addiction. Our lead product candidate is ANEB-001, a potent, small molecule cannabinoid receptor antagonist, to address the unmet medical need for a specific antidote for ACI. ANEB-001 is an orally bioavailable, rapidly absorbed treatment that we anticipate will reverse the symptoms of ACI, in most cases within 1 hour of administration. Our proprietary position in the treatment of ACI is protected by one issued patent and rights to one patent application covering various methods of use of the compound and delivery systems. We began a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for ANEB-001 in December 2021 in the Netherlands.

Cannabinoids are a class of chemical compounds that are naturally occurring and are primarily found in cannabis plant extracts. The two major cannabinoids found in cannabis plant extracts include THC and CBD. These compounds bind themselves to CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, which are found throughout the body. Specifically, CB1 receptors are concentrated in the brain and central nervous system, while CB2 receptors are found mostly in peripheral organs and are associated with the immune system. When the chemical compounds bind themselves to these cannabinoid receptors, the process elicits certain physiological responses. Physiological responses to cannabinoids may vary among individuals. Some of the effects of cannabinoids have been shown to impact nervous system functions, immune responses, muscular motor functions, gastrointestinal maintenance, blood sugar management, and the integrity of ocular functions.
 
Individuals can use or consume cannabinoids in natural or unnatural formulations, orally or by inhalation, and intentionally and unintentionally, all of which can result in intoxication. Natural formulations include edibles and marijuana cigarettes; unnatural formulations include synthetics. Individuals consume cannabinoids orally by ingesting edibles or synthetics and by inhalation through smoking marijuana cigarettes or synthetics. Cannabinoids can also be ingested unintentionally through these same methods where, for example, children consume edibles by mistaking them for common consumer items like candy that would not otherwise contain THC. Symptoms of ACI produced by edibles and synthetics can include psychosis, panic and anxiety, feelings of paranoia, agitation, hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and death. Many of these symptoms can require emergency medical attention and can take hours to days to resolve depending on the particular product and amount ingested. Currently, there is no specific treatment to reverse ACI and physicians have to rely on supportive care, including benzodiazepines, and wait for the body to metabolize the THC or synthetic cannabinoid.

Our Market Opportunity
 
ACI has become a widespread health issue in the United States as an increasing number of states have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. As of June 30, 2022, cannabis was legal for recreational use in 19 states and the District of Columbia and legal for medical use in 38 states. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and recent news reports have described how the stress, anxiety and depression from the prolonged stay-at-home conditions surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic appears to result in excessive drug and cannabis use by individuals, whether in jurisdictions where such use is legal or not.
 

ACI frequently occurs due to the ingestion of edibles, which can contain relatively large amounts of THC, and consumption of synthetics. Symptoms of ACI produced by edibles and synthetics can include psychosis, panic and anxiety, feelings of paranoia, agitation, hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and death. These symptoms can require emergency medical attention and can take hours to days to resolve. According to an article published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine that analyzed data from NEDS, an estimated 1.1 million emergency department visits were associated with cannabis in 2014. We have performed our own independent analysis of all currently available NEDS datasets and estimated that the number of cannabis-associated emergency department visits increased to 1.74 million patients in 2018. The number of cannabis-associated emergency department visits has grown at a 15% compounded annual growth rate from 2012 to 2018, which is when states first began legalizing recreational cannabis use.

We believe that both the number of cannabis-associated emergency department visits and the unmet medical need will continue to grow due to the increasing availability and consumption of edibles. In THC-containing edibles, the median dose of THC can be many times more potent than the recommended safe dosage and as much as eight times more potent than a rolled marijuana cigarette. Edibles are frequently manufactured as common consumer products, such as brownies, cookies, candies and gummy snacks with brightly-colored packaging. THC concentrations in edibles peak after a delay of about two to four hours from ingestion. This time to peak concentration contrasts with smoking cannabis, which causes THC concentrations to peak in about three to 10 minutes from inhalation. Consumers possibly will approach edibles with the same serving size expectations as consumer products without THC. Moreover, children are particularly at risk for accidentally consuming edibles due to the edibles’ brightly-colored packaging and formulation into candies and sweets. The confluence of these factors can be dangerous and increases the risk of ACI. Emergency department visits were 33 times more likely for edibles as compared with other routes of cannabis consumption, according to the recent article “Mental Health-related Emergency Department Visits Associated with Cannabis in Colorado,” published in Academic Emergency Medicine (May 2018). Sales of edibles are rapidly growing, according to data collected by Statista, and are expected to continue growing into the future.
 
In November 2020, we sponsored a survey of U.S. physicians concerning patient emergency room visits for ACI within the past 12 months. Based on a survey of 27 emergency room physicians throughout the United States, the surveyed physicians saw on average 10.5 patients (a range of two to 45 patients) with cannabis intoxication per month. The survey asked these physicians to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (i) the need for a cannabinoid antagonist to treat cannabis intoxication; (ii) the likelihood of their prescribing a cannabinoid antagonist that reverses cannabis intoxication within 30 minutes of administration; and (iii) the likelihood of such cannabinoid antagonist reducing the need for supportive medication to manage certain cannabis intoxication symptoms, such as agitation and acute psychosis. In response to these questions, the surveyed physicians ranked the need for a cannabinoid antagonist at an average of 7.52 out of 10, the likelihood of prescribing a cannabinoid antagonist that reverses cannabis intoxication within 30 minutes of administration at an average of 7.44 out of 10, and the likelihood of a specific cannabinoid antagonist reducing the need for supportive medication to manage certain ACI symptoms at an average of 7.48 out of 10. Although the survey pertained specifically to a cannabinoid antagonist that reverses cannabis intoxication within 30 minutes, we believe the survey results are indicative of likely prescribing behavior for any otherwise comparable product that takes effect rapidly even if not specifically within 30 minutes.

We believe that the market opportunity for our lead product candidate, ANEB-001, will continue to expand and accelerate if additional states pass laws to legalize recreational cannabis use. In Colorado, one of the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, the Colorado Department of Health and Environment reported that by 2018 marijuana use by adults one or more times during the past 30 days roughly doubled in the years following the state’s legalization of cannabis. On April 1, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives, for the second time, voted in favor of a bill to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level by removing cannabis from the list of controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act. Although it is currently uncertain whether this bill will be subsequently approved by the U.S. Senate and signed into law by the President, in the event the use of cannabis is legalized in the United States at the federal level, we believe that the greater anticipated number of users will significantly increase the potential need for our lead candidate.
 
We believe that intoxication due to synthetic cannabinoids is an area with particularly high unmet medical need. Synthetics are among the fastest growing class of psychoactive drugs worldwide and can be as much as 85 times as potent as THC. This likely reflects the structural promiscuity of the CB1 receptor. In addition, the negative effects of an intoxication from synthetics can be longer lasting and more severe when compared with THC. These negative effects could include seizures and other dangerous outcomes. Compared with natural cannabis products, synthetics have lower shipping weights and can more readily evade traditional drug screening methods.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to create a therapeutic to treat the underlying cause of ACI. As noted above, there are currently no FDA approved medical treatments on the market to specifically alleviate the negative neuropsychological effects of ACI. The absence and growing unmet need for such a treatment gives us the unique opportunity to create a novel solution and become a leader in the cannabinoid treatment space. To achieve our goal, our strategy will be guided by the following principles:

● | Develop and commercialize our ANEB-001 antagonist in the United States. We commenced our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in December 2021 and announced positive data from Part A of the study in July 2022. We believe the data from this study may facilitate discussions of a regulatory path for ANEB-001 in the United States. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Explore strategic collaborations to commercialize ANEB-001. Our plan is to widely commercialize ANEB-001, if approved. To accomplish this objective, we may partner with companies that possess a direct sales force and sales representatives. 
● | Strive for capital efficiency in developing ANEB-001. We aim to be capital efficient in our development of ANEB-001 by outsourcing our clinical research and data management. We anticipate this will lower our clinical development costs and improve our ability to efficiently commercialize ANEB-001 if it is approved by the FDA. 
● | Introduce promising product candidate extensions. We are in the initial stages of developing a non-oral formulation of ANEB-001 with the same API. 
● | Develop future product candidates to treat substance-related addiction. We intend to leverage our expertise in the endocannabinoid system to develop additional product candidates for the treatment of substance addiction. CB1 antagonists have been shown to be promising in treating substance-related addiction. We believe that there is a large and growing unmet medical need for new treatment options because of the opioid epidemic.

Our Clinical Trials and Milestones
 
We are developing ANEB-001 as an acute treatment to quickly and effectively combat the symptoms of ACI. ANEB-001 was originally under development by Vernalis as a potential chronic treatment for obesity and other metabolic indications.
Preclinical Data
 
The preclinical characterization of ANEB-001 was performed at Vernalis’ internal laboratory in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2006. The compound was tested as a displacer in established radioligand binding assays for the CB1 receptor. ANEB-001 displaced the antagonist radioligand, [3H]-SR141716A from the human CB1 receptor with high affinity (0.55 nM) and was shown to be a competitive antagonist in cAMP assays. In vitro testing as a displacer in 90 binding assays and 19 enzyme and functional assays, showed that ANEB-001 had >1000x selectivity with the human CB1 receptor over all other tested receptors. Further, Vernalis demonstrated that oral administration of ANEB-001 reduced hypolocomotion in mice after 30 minutes, effectively reversing the action of THC. C57 mice administered THC 3 mg/kg in 10 minutes pre-test exhibited reduced locomotor activity when placed in automated locomotor activity cages for 15 minutes. Providing it orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg 30 minutes pre-test significantly reversed the action of THC on the total activity time parameter (p<0.01 by one way ANOVA and Newman Keuls test, n=7 per group).
Historical Clinical Studies
 
In 2006 and 2007, two Phase 1 studies for the treatment of obesity were conducted by Vernalis for ANEB-001.


First Phase 1 trial
 
The Phase 1 study (V24343-1Ob-01) administered single (Part A) and multiple (Part B) ascending doses of ANEB-001 for up to 14 days in otherwise healthy overweight and mildly obese subjects.

● | Part A randomized 18 healthy volunteers to receive either a placebo (n=18) or two single oral doses of ANEB-001, with doses ranging from 1 mg to 200 mg. No severe adverse events were observed in either group in Part A. There was no difference between treatment groups in Part A in overall incidence, number of or severity of adverse events. Probable drug-related events in the treatment arm were nausea (22%), dizziness (11%), hiccups (8%), and decreased appetite (8%). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Part B randomized 32 obese volunteers to receive either a placebo (eight obese volunteers) or four different doses of ANEB-001 for 14 days (24 obese volunteers). No severe adverse events were observed in either group in Part B, but an increased number of mild and moderate adverse events was observed in the obese volunteers who received the two higher dose arms (200/50 mg and 100 mg). The observed adverse events included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, hiccups, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis and feeling hot. We believe these adverse events are “on-target,” meaning they reflect CB1 antagonism, because these adverse events have also been observed with other CB1 antagonists. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pharmacokinetic measurements in Part A of the Phase 1 study demonstrated that ANEB-001 was rapidly absorbed by the body following oral administration and achieved blood concentrations anticipated to be sufficient to block the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.

Vernalis also measured the impact of ANEB-001 on anxiety and depression in Part B of the Phase 1 study. Vernalis measured anxiety by using the Spielberger state score, a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety. Vernalis found no significant impact on anxiety, except for the 200/50 mg arm, which showed increased anxiety at all assessment times. The change was driven by a single subject and may be explained by somatic adverse events, which contributed to the Spielberger score. For depression, HAMD21 was used and small increases were noted in the 75/15 mg and 200/50 mg dose, which we believe were likely driven by somatic symptoms.
 
Summarizing the results from the Phase 1 study, ANEB-001 doses between 1 mg and 150 mg were found to be very well tolerated in both single and multiple doses with an adverse events profile similar to placebo. There was no observed effect on the cardiovascular system, ECGs, labs or physical exams and no significant effects on anxiety or depression scores.
 
With regard to pharmacodynamics, a marked reduction in test meal energy intake was seen even at the lowest dose level in Phase 1 Part B (p<0.01 on Day 14 for OD 100 mg, p<0.05 on Day 7 for OD 100 mg, not statistically significant for all other cohorts). Further, Vernalis observed statistically significant decreases in body weight (p<0.001 on Day 14 for OD 100 mg, p<0.05 for OD 50/5 mg and OD 200/50 mg, not significant for OD75/15 mg) indicating that ANEB-001 was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and antagonize central cannabinoid receptors. P-value is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance. The smaller the p-value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, the outcome is considered statistically significant. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05.
 
Second Phase 1 trial
 
The second Phase 1 study conducted by Vernalis (V24343-1Ob-02) compared the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose (1 to 200 mg) of ANEB-001 between fed and fasted states in eight subjects that were lean and in eight subjects that were overweight. There were no apparent differences in the tolerability of ANEB-001 between the subjects that were in fed and fasted states or between subjects that were lean and overweight. Total AUC (or area under the curve) was approximately 30% higher in subjects in the fed state compared to the subjects in the fasted state, with similar systemic exposure for the lean and overweight subjects.
 
The results of the historical Phase 1 studies demonstrate that ANEB-001 was well tolerated among healthy and obese subjects. There were no serious adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse event was gastrointestinal discomfort, which also occurred in subjects that were administered placebos. Based on the promising results of the historical Phase 1 studies, we believe ANEB-001 may offer the following clinical and product benefits:
 

● | Oral bioavailability. ANEB-001 will be available as an oral treatment in the form of a pill, capsule or tablet. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Rapid absorption. We believe ANEB-001 has the potential to rapidly reverse the signs and symptoms of ACI in as little as 1 hour. 
● | Low likelihood of drug-to-drug interactions. Preclinical testing demonstrated that ANEB-001 did not inhibit the metabolic enzymes cytochromes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. 
● | Rapid onset of action. This orally administered treatment has been shown in clinical study to have CB1 antagonist effects in as little as 1 hour. 
● | Potential First-in-Class Treatment. We are currently not aware of any competing products that are further along in the development process than ANEB-001 to specifically reverse the symptoms of ACI. 
● | No serious adverse events. A single dose of the drug is unlikely to produce adverse events associated with chronic dosing. The most commonly reported adverse effect in the previous Phase 1 studies was gastrointestinal discomfort, which also occurred in subjects who were administered a placebo.

Anebulo Clinical Studies
 
Phase 2 THC Challenge Study in Healthy Volunteers
 
We commenced a Phase 2 clinical proof-of-concept study in December 2021 at the Center for Human Drug Research (“CHDR”) in the Netherlands to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of a single dose of ANEB-001 in treating healthy subjects challenged with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC, the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Part A of the study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 60 healthy adult occasional cannabis users randomized to three treatment arms of 20 subjects per arm. All subjects were challenged with a single oral dose of 10.5 mg THC and then treated with single oral doses of 50 mg ANEB-001, 100 mg ANEB-001, or placebo. Subjects were monitored for 24 hours to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, and repeatedly tested to determine potential effects on endpoints related to ACI symptoms. The tests also included a series of validated measures of subjective CNS symptoms using visual analog scale (“VAS”) assessments, as well as objective measures of intoxication. We completed Part A of the Phase 2 study in June 2022 and announced the data in a press release on July 5, 2022.
 
Subjects challenged with THC and treated with placebo showed substantial CNS effects including feeling high, decreased alertness, increased body sway, and increased heart rate. Compared to placebo, treatment of subjects with ANEB-001 led to a significant, robust, and sustained reduction in the VAS feeling high score (p < 0.0001 at both dose levels) and improvement in the VAS alertness scale (p < 0.01). In addition, the proportion of subjects reporting feeling high on the VAS was significantly reduced by ANEB-001 (p < 0.001). Although THC-induced effects on body sway and heart rate in this study were small, there was also a trend towards statistical improvement of these parameters with ANEB-001 treatment compared to placebo. The 50 mg and 100 mg doses had similar results, suggesting that lower doses should be explored.
 
These data demonstrated a highly statistically significant reduction in key symptoms of ACI, with only 10% of subjects in the 50 mg ANEB-001 group and 30% in the 100 mg group reporting feeling high compared to 75% of subjects in the placebo group (p < 0.001). ANEB-001 was well tolerated in these healthy volunteers. Preliminary safety information showed all adverse events were mild and transient, except in the case of one subject in the 50 mg ANEB-001 group who experienced moderate nausea and vomiting. Pharmacokinetic data are pending and additional analyses of Part A data, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) correlations, are planned.
 
Based on the encouraging data from Part A, we plan to initiate Part B of the study at CHDR by the end of third quarter 2022 to evaluate lower doses of ANEB-001. We are currently collaborating with the Model-Informed Drug Development (“MIDD”) group at the FDA to develop a PK/PD model that will potentially allow prediction of optimal doses for treatment of ACI subjects. Preparations are ongoing for an observational study in ACI subjects in the emergency department setting to further support the PK/PD model and ANEB-001 development. Submission of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for ANEB-001 to initiate U.S. trials is anticipated by the end of 2022.
 
We believe the ongoing Phase 2 study will lay the foundation for us to engage with the FDA and/or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and conduct more extensive clinical trials with the goal of generating additional clinical data that will ultimately enable us to file a marketing application with the FDA.


Contract Research Organizations
 
We have engaged contract research organizations (“CROs”) to assist us with conducting clinical trials and to provide us with consulting and development services in the various phases of the drug development process. We currently have a consultancy agreement with Traxeus Pharma Services Limited (“Traxeus”), which we entered into on July 15, 2020 (the “Consultancy Agreement”). Pursuant to the Consultancy Agreement, Traxeus provides certain pharmaceutical development services and deliverables to us in relation to the retest of an existing batch of drug substance. These services include the manufacturing and testing of a demonstration batch of the drug substance and the completion of formulation and process development for the drug product. Under the Consultancy Agreement, Traxeus is permitted to provide services to third parties that are not directly competitive to us and we are permitted to engage other CROs. The Consultancy Agreement can be terminated immediately by either party if a material breach is committed and not remedied within 60 days or a party is unable to carry on business, becomes insolvent or is subject to similar processes in any jurisdiction. In addition, we may terminate any statement of work arising under the Consultancy Agreement by providing Traxeus at least 30 days’ written notice. We plan to continue to engage CROs like Traxeus and other pharmaceutical services providers to assist us with clinical trials, the development of our lead product candidate ANEB-001.

Vernalis License Agreement
 
On May 26, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Vernalis Development Limited, formerly Vernalis (R&D) Limited (“Vernalis”). Pursuant to the License Agreement, Vernalis granted us an exclusive worldwide royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize a compound that we refer to as ANEB-001, as well as access to and a right of reference with respect to any regulatory materials under its control. The License Agreement allows us to sublicense the rights thereunder to any person with similar or greater financial resources and expertise without Vernalis’ prior consent, provided the proposed sublicensee is not developing or commercializing a product that contains a CB1 antagonist or is for the same indication covered by the trials or market authorization for ANEB-001. In exchange for the exclusive license, we agreed to pay Vernalis a non-refundable signature fee of $150,000, total potential developmental milestone payments of up to $29,900,000, total potential sales milestone payments of up to $35,000,000, and low to mid-single digit royalties on net sales.
 
Under the License Agreement, we purchased the API for ANEB-001 from Vernalis on an “as is” basis for $20,000. We have the sole discretion to carry out the development and commercialization of ANEB-001, including obtaining regulatory approvals, and we are responsible for all costs and expenses in connection therewith. We have access to certain regulatory materials, including study reports from clinical and non-clinical trials, under Vernalis’ control. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop and commercialize ANEB-001 in the United States and certain European countries and (ii) conduct a Phase 2 and human clinical trial within specified periods, which periods could be extended for a nominal fee. We also agreed to provide Vernalis with periodic reports of our activities and notice of market authorization within specified timeframes.
 
With respect to intellectual property, both parties agreed to retain sole ownership over their respective intellectual property as of the date of the License Agreement. In addition, we retain the sole right over certain patent rights (including patent applications) and know-how controlled by us that are necessary or reasonably useful to developing and commercializing ANEB-001 during the term of the License Agreement.
 
The License Agreement continues for an indefinite term unless and until it is terminated or until such time as all royalties and other sums cease to be payable thereunder. Our obligations to pay royalties commence upon the first commercial sale of our product and cease upon the later to occur of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of our product, or (ii) the expiration date of the regulatory exclusivity of our product. We may terminate the License Agreement in its entirety at any time by providing 60 days’ prior notice to Vernalis. Moreover, a party may terminate the License Agreement for cause (i) upon written notice when the other party commits a material breach not remedied within the specified timeframes and defaults on its obligations thereunder, or (ii) when the other party is insolvent as more particularly described therein. In the event of termination, all rights and licenses granted by Vernalis will revert immediately to Vernalis; all outstanding sums as of the termination date will be immediately due and payable to Vernalis; and we will return or destroy, at Vernalis’ request, any regulatory materials, information pertaining to ANEB-001, and any unused API purchased from Vernalis. If Vernalis terminates the License Agreement due to our material breach or insolvency, or if we terminate the License Agreement at will, both parties will negotiate in good faith to grant Vernalis a license to such intellectual property and regulatory materials needed to develop and commercialize ANEB-001 and provide appropriate compensation to us within six months of the termination date.
 
Competition
 
The clinical biotechnology industry is a competitive industry characterized by technological innovation and growth. Our competitors include other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and public and private research institutions. These entities engage in efforts to research, discover and develop new medicines and treatments for substance use. These entities also seek patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results and may compete with us in recruiting skilled talent. Some of these entities are larger and better funded than us. Our management can make no assurances that we can effectively compete with these competitors. Potential current competitors include Aelis Farma, which is developing a medication based on a pregnenolone derivative to treat cannabis use disorders, and Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is developing a drinabant injection to treat acute cannabis overdose.

Research and Development
 
We are making, and expect to continue to make, substantial expenditures to fund proprietary research and development of our ANEB-001 product candidate and to support preclinical testing and clinical trials necessary for regulatory filings. Our research and development team, including a third-party CRO, is continually undertaking efforts to advance research and development goals. During the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $2,962,000 and $2,270,000, respectively.
Regulation
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
We operate in an extensively regulated industry. Governmental authorities at all levels in the United States and in other countries regulate aspects of bringing therapeutics, drugs, and other biologics to market, including research, testing, safety, product approval, development, manufacture, efficacy, quality control, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution, sales, imports and exports of our products.
 
As a therapeutic product for human use, ANEB-001 will be subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and similar regulatory requirements in other countries. Regulatory requirements include, among other things, rigorous preclinical and clinical testing. The processes obtaining regulatory approval, commercializing our product and maintaining compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the substantial expenditure of time and financial resources and play a significant role in our research and development, production, and marketing activities. Failure to comply with these regulatory processes and other requirements could delay our ability to receive regulatory approvals, adversely affect the commercialization of our product, and hinder our ability to receive royalties or revenues.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations during and after the product development and approval process could result in administrative or judicial sanctions. Such sanctions include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, placement a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, seizure of products, partial or complete suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal penalties. The FDA generally requires the following before a drug can be marketed in the United States:
 

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission of an IND, which must become effective before the commencement of human clinical studies; 
● | Approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each clinical site before the initiation of each trial; 
● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | Preparation and submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); 
● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product, or its components, are produced to ensure compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”) regulations and to ensure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Given that the testing and approval process requires a substantial commitment of time, effort and financial resources, we cannot ensure that our product will be granted approval on a timely basis.
 
As part of the IND, an IND sponsor must submit the preclinical test results, along with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters for monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be assessed (among other things) if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue after submission of the IND. The IND becomes automatically effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises questions or concerns in response to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within the 30-day timeframe. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding issues before commencing the clinical study. The FDA may impose clinical holds due to safety concerns or non-compliance on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class at any time before or during clinical studies. In addition, the FDA can impose partial clinical holds prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies for a certain dose or of a certain duration.
 
In accordance with GCP regulations, all clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators. These regulations require informed consent in writing from all research subjects before their participation in any clinical study. An IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must continuously review and re-approve the study at least annually. Among other things, the IRB considers whether the risks to individual participants in the clinical study are minimal and reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be given to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative. The IRB must also monitor the clinical study until completed. Each new clinical protocol and any amendments thereto must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRB for approval. The protocols detail the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety (among other things). Study sites are subject to inspection for compliance with GCP.
 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. In Phase 1, the product is initially introduced to a limited number of healthy human subjects or patients and may be tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of certain products intended to treat severe or life-threatening diseases, particularly when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. Phase 2 involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify potential adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and schedule. 
● | Phase 3. In Phase 3, clinical studies are conducted on a larger patient population located in geographically dispersed clinical sites to further evaluate the dosage, clinical efficacy and safety of the product. Phase 3 clinical studies are intended to determine the overall risks and benefits of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

 
Progress reports explaining the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA at least annually. Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. There is no guarantee that Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Likewise, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
Upon the successful completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is submitted to the FDA requesting approval to market the product. The NDA reports the results of product development, preclinical and clinical studies, descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information.
 
In connection with the submission of an NDA, the payment of a substantial application user fee is required (although a waiver is available under limited circumstances, including, for the first human drug application submitted by a small business or its affiliate). The sponsor of an approved NDA is also required to pay annual program user fees.
 
The FDA may also require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS typically includes risk minimization tools, medication guides, assessment plans, physician communication plans, and elements to ensure safe use, including restricted distribution methods, and patient registries.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. Rather than accept an application for filing, the FDA may request additional information. In such a case, an applicant must re-submit the application along with the additional information, which remains subject to further FDA review. Once an application is accepted for filing, the FDA performs an in-depth substantive review to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use.
 
The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of experts for review, evaluation and recommendation regarding its approval and any conditions that may apply thereto. The FDA, while not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, considers such recommendations when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will also inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure clinical data supporting the submission comply with GCP.
 
The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if regulatory requirements are not satisfied or additional clinical data and information is required. Even after such data and information is furnished, the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA for failure to satisfy regulatory requirements. Data from clinical studies may not always be conclusive. Moreover, the FDA may disagree with the applicant’s interpretation of the data.
 
After evaluating an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter indicating completion of the review cycle. A complete response letter typically sets forth specific conditions that must be satisfied to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA may identify minor deficiencies, such as requiring labeling changes, or major deficiencies, such as requiring additional clinical studies. The complete response letter may also recommend actions to ready the application for approval. An applicant can respond to a complete response letter by correcting all deficiencies and re-submitting the application, withdrawing the application or requesting a hearing.
 
Even after additional information is submitted, the FDA may determine that an application does not satisfy regulatory requirements and reject it. Once all conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
Even after regulatory approval is obtained, approval may be restricted to specific diseases and dosages or limited indications for use. Such limitations could affect the commercial value of the product. On the product labeling, the FDA may require certain contraindications, warnings or precautions. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further evaluate safety and effectiveness. The FDA may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved commercialized products. After approval, certain changes to the approved product remain subject to additional testing requirements, FDA review and approval. Such changes to the approved product include adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims.

Approved products manufactured or distributed in accordance with the FDA regulatory process remain subject to continuing FDA oversight post-approval. Continuing regulatory requirements include periodic reporting, record-keeping, product sampling, product distribution, and advertising and reporting on adverse experiences, deviations, and other issues with the product. In addition, most post-approval changes to the approved product, including adding new indications or other labeling claims, remain subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also continuing obligations to pay annual user fees for marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA strictly regulates the information presented on products on the market, including information on labeling, advertising, and promotion of products. Products may only be promoted for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the rules prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. A company that improperly promotes off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Manufacturers must also continue to comply with extensive CGMP regulations, which requires a commitment of time and financial resources. FDA review and approval is generally required for post-approval changes to the manufacturing process and other changes to the approved product, including the addition of new indications and additional labeling claims.
 
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDA and state agencies may periodically inspect these establishments, sometimes without prior notice, to ensure compliance with CGMP regulations and other obligations. CGMP requirements apply to all stages of the product manufacturing process, including processing, production, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment.
 
Prior FDA approval is often required for changes to the manufacturing process to be implemented. FDA regulations require investigation and correction of departures from CGMP requirements. The FDA may also impose reporting and documentation obligations upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers used by the sponsor. As a result, to remain compliant with CGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to commit time, effort and financial resources to production and quality control.
 
The FDA may impose other post-approval requirements as a condition to approving an application, such as post-marketing testing (including Phase 4 clinical trials) and surveillance to monitor and assess the product’s safety and effectiveness upon commercialization.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if an applicant fails to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or if certain issues arise after the product is introduced to the market. For instance, a subsequent discovery of previously unknown issues, including adverse events of unexpected frequency or severity, problems with the manufacturing process, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, could result in restrictions on the product or a complete withdrawal from the market.
 
In such cases, potential consequences include revisions to the approved labeling to include new safety information; post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate new safety risks; and imposition of restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include:
 

● | Restrictions on the manufacturing or marketing of the product (including complete withdrawal or recall of the product); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs; 
● | Suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
● | Product seizures or detentions; 
● | FDA’s refusal to allow imports or exports of products; or 
● | Civil penalties, criminal penalties or injunctions.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States, commercial sales of pharmaceutical products subject to regulatory approval could be conditioned on whether third-party payors (such as government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations) are able to provide coverage and reimbursement in connection with the products.
 
Coverage and reimbursement of costs are areas of significant uncertainty for any products subject to regulatory approval. The process for determining coverage versus reimbursement may vary widely among third-party payors. Third-party payors may also impose additional requirements on and restrictions to coverage and reimbursement, which could influence the purchase of certain healthcare services and products.
 
Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which could omit some FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors may also place drugs at certain formulary levels that result in a lower reimbursement and higher cost-sharing obligation for patients. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product may not necessarily imply approval of an adequate reimbursement rate. In addition, the unavailability of third-party reimbursement may affect our ability to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Coverage by one third-party payor may not necessarily indicate or imply coverage or reimbursement by other third-party payors. Also, the level or scope of coverage and reimbursement may vary significantly among third-party payors. In addition to scrutinizing the safety and efficacy of medical products and services, third-party payors have increasingly begun to examine and challenge the price, cost-effectiveness and necessity of certain products and services. Thus, to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any products approved for sale, the conducting of expensive pharmacoeconomic studies may be required to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such products. There is a chance that third-party payors may not consider our product medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors make such a determination, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans. If third-party payors do cover the product, the returns from sales of our product may not sufficiently yield a profit.
 
Furthermore, federal and state governmental authorities have increasingly shown an interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit government-paid healthcare costs. Such cost containment programs include restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, price controls and requirements to substitute branded prescription drugs with generic products. The adoption and expansion of such restrictive policies and controls could impose limitations or exclusions from coverage for our product.
 
In the United States, we expect third-party payors and government authorities to increase emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures, which will impact the pricing and coverage for pharmaceutical products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we achieve favorable coverage and reimbursement status for an approved product, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates could still be implemented in the future.
 
Protection of Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect our intellectual property in a variety of ways to promote the development of our product candidate and business. Our strategy to safeguard this intellectual property includes the following:
 
● Patents and patent applications. We are in the process of obtaining method of use patents intended to cover our ANEB-001 product candidate, which are important to the development of our business. We have filed or intend to file patent applications related to aspects of ANEB-001, our product candidate. We have obtained one issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 11,141,404, titled “Formulations And Methods For Treating Acute Cannabinoid Overdose.” We intend to pursue foreign jurisdictions for our patent applications at the relevant time. The patents are expected to expire in 2040.

● Regulatory exclusivity. Upon approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve a generic version of the drug. In addition, in seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA and then later challenged pursuant to a paragraph IV certification. As part of the Paragraph IV certification process, an NDA holder may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit against the ANDA applicant. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit by an NDA holder automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the Orange Book-listed patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. Finally, we could receive an orphan drug designation, which would grant a total of seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States under the US Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or pediatric drug designation, which provides NDA holders (under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)) a six-month extension of any exclusivity (patent or non-patent) for a drug.
 
● Trade secrets. We rely on trade secret laws of general applicability for aspects of our business that are not readily amenable to or appropriate for patent protection.
 
● Confidentiality agreements. We rely upon confidentiality agreements signed by our employees, consultants and third parties.
 
● License agreement. We have entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Vernalis to develop, strengthen and commercialize our ANEB-001 compound. This exclusive in-licensing opportunity allows us to maintain and enhance our proprietary position in ANEB-001.
 
● Trademarks. We use “Anebulo” as our trademark. As we develop our drug candidate and business, we intend to add trademarks to our portfolio of intellectual property.
 
We believe these methods provide us material defensibility around our core intellectual property.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of June 30, 2022, we had four full-time employees, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we have a number of outside consultants who are not on our payroll, who are involved directly in scientific research and development activities. We believe that we maintain strong relations with our employees. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
