 Item 1. Business.
 
Background
 
Kaya Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in 1993 under the name Gourmet Market, Inc. and has engaged in a number of businesses. Its name was changed on May 11, 2007 to Netspace International Holdings, Inc. (“Netspace”). Netspace acquired 100% of the capital stock of Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc., a Florida corporation in January 2010 in a stock for stock transaction and issued 100,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock to existing shareholders of the Florida corporation. The Company’s name was changed in October 2010 from Netspace International Holdings, Inc. to Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc.
 
From 2010 through 2014 the Company was engaged in seeking to develop a biofuels business. In January 2015, the Company determined that it was in the best interests of its stockholders to discontinue its biofuel development activities, and to instead leverage its agricultural and business development experience and focus all its resources on the development of legal medical and recreational marijuana opportunities in the United States and in select international markets.
 
Legal Medical and Recreational Marijuana Operations
 
In January 2014, KAYS incorporated a subsidiary, Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc. a Florida corporation (“MJAI”) to focus on opportunities in the legal recreational and medical marijuana in the United States. MJAI has concentrated its efforts in Oregon, where through controlled Oregon limited liability companies, it initially secured licenses to operate a medical marijuana dispensary (an “MMD”) and since the advent of legalization of recreational cannabis use in Oregon, has secured licenses to operate a total of four retail outlets for the sale of recreational and medical cannabis, as well as each hold a license for home delivery of cannabis products. Additionally, MJAI has operated medical Marijuana Grows in Oregon, and KAYS has purchased 26 acres which it has targeted for development of the Kaya Farms™ Medical and Recreational Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex. The Company has developed the Kaya Shack™ brand for its retail operations.

In March 2014, we applied for and were awarded our first license to operate an MMD and on July 3, 2014 opened our first Kaya Shack™ Medical Marijuana Dispensary in Portland, Oregon, thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own and operate an MMD. Initial customer acceptance and media coverage was very positive, including many references to KAYS as the “Starbucks of Medical Marijuana” by television news stations, news print publications and online news sources. In March 2015, the Company changed its name to Kaya Holdings, Inc. to better reflect its new plan of operations.
 
In April 2015, KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own a majority interest in a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. In October 2015, concurrent with Oregon commencing legal sales of recreational marijuana through MMDs, KAYS opened its second retail operation in Salem, Oregon, our first Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore. Oregon. During 2015, the Company also consolidated its grow operations and manufacturing operations into a single facility in Portland, Oregon.
 
In 2016, Oregon began the process to transition legal marijuana sales from Oregon Health Authority (“OHA”) licensed MMDs and grow operations to Oregon Liquor Control Commission (“OLCC”) licensed recreational marijuana retailers and producer and processing facilities. Effective January 1, 2017, all retailers of recreational marijuana were required to have a recreational marijuana sales license issued by the OLLC for each retail outlet operated.
 
Accordingly, in 2016 the Company applied for OLLC licenses for its two initial Kaya Shack™ retail outlets (Portland, Oregon and South Salem, Oregon), and also submitted license applications for its two additional locations, which were under construction and development at that time.


Recent Developments
 
OLCC Licensing and Additional Legal and Recreational Marijuana Stores
 
In late December 2016, we received our OLCC recreational, medical and home delivery license for the South Salem Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore (Kaya Shack™ OLCC Marijuana Retailer License #1) and recreational and medical sales continued without interruption from 2016 through the present at that location.
 
On March 21, 2017, we received our OLCC recreational, medical and home delivery license for the North Salem Kaya Shack™ outlet (Kaya Shack™ OLCC Marijuana Retailer License #2) a 2,600-square foot Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore in North Salem, Oregon, whereupon the location opened for business with both recreational and medical sales.
 
On May 2, 2017, we received our OLCC recreational, medical and home delivery license for our Portland Kaya Shack™ outlet (Kaya Shack™ OLCC Marijuana Retailer License #3) after a delay of approximately four months. During that period, we were limited to solely medical sales at the Portland location. Upon receipt of Kaya Shack™ OLCC Marijuana Retailer License #3, recreational sales recommenced at that location.
 
On February 15, 2018 we received our Our OLCC recreational, medical and home delivery license for the Central Salem Kaya Shack™ outlet (Kaya Shack™ OLCC Marijuana Retailer License #4) a 3,100-square foot Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore in Central Salem, Oregon. After various construction and permitting delays, on April 12, 2018 the location opened for business with both recreational and medical sales.

Additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores
 
In addition to the four Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores the Company operates in Oregon, the Company plans to identify and lease locations for, license and operate up to four additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores in other Oregon markets over the next 18 to 24 months, as well as explore opportunities in other states to increase its retail footprint. Additionally, the Company is exploring opportunities to further its operation in Oregon and elsewhere through the acquisition of currently licensed and operating retail operations, which can be converted to the Kaya Shack™ model.
 Expansion of Grow and Manufacturing Operations
 
On March 21, 2017, KAYS announced that it was in the process of expanding its grow and manufacturing operations and had retained a realtor to assist in identifying a suitable 30-60 acre tract of land in Oregon which would permit KAYS to expand its grow operations. As part of this expansion, KAYS ceased operations of its Portland grow facility at the end of March 2017, arranged to maintain its genetics library of over 30 strains of cannabis at an OHA licensed medical grow site and contracted with farmers to meet demand until the new facility is secured, built and fully operational.
 
In August 2017, KAYS acquired a 26 acre parcel in Lebanon, Oregon, which KAYS intends to develop as a legal cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facility. KAYS believes that the acquisition of a property will position the Company for future development, including increased Marijuana Canopy production to the maximum extent allowed by law through use of both greenhouse and outdoor grows, as well as expansion of its production capabilities with brands in oils, vape cartridges, concentrates, a selection of edibles, and infused creams and lotions.
 A video of the Kaya Farms™ (Architect’s Project Rendition) can be seen at the following link:
 https://www.dropbox.com/s/3po31ksdilcl9l9/Kaya_Farms%20Final.mp4?dl=0
 On February 9, 2018 KAYS submitted a site plan review for the Company’s envisioned 101,000 square foot OLCC licensed Kaya Farms™ Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex and an application for a conditional use permit for marijuana processing on the Company owned 26.50-acre property zoned Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) with the Linn County, Oregon Planning and Building Department.
 On March 9, 2018 the Company was notified by the Linn County, Oregon Planning and Building Department that the application was deemed complete and received an official letter of completeness with respect to the application. The formal “Letter of Completeness,” sent March 9, 2018 by a Linn County Senior Planner, confirmed the eligibility of the Company’s 26-acre plot for the purposes of growing legal cannabis, as well as the eligibility of the property for a special purpose exemption for the Company’s proposed manufacturing operations. The County has tentatively scheduled a decision on the application for April 20, 2018.
 
$2.1 Million Financing
 
In March 2017, the Company completed a $2.1 million financing with an institutional investor (the “Institutional Investor”) who had previously furnished KAYS with $1.2 million in financing, pursuant to a financing agreement (the “$2.1M Financing Agreement”) entered into between the Company and the Institutional Investor in December 2016. Pursuant to the $2.1M Financing Agreement, the Institutional Investor purchased $2.1 million in principal amount of convertible notes (the “$2.1M Notes”) from the Company as follows:

• | $400,000 in principal amount of $2.1M Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.04; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $700,000 in principal amount of $2.1M Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.07; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $1,000,000 in principal amount of $2.1M Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.10. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purchase price for the $2.1M Notes is equal to the principal amount thereof. The $2.1M Notes have a term of two years from issuance and bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) annum, which accrues and is payable to together with interest at maturity. The Investor may convert the principal amount of the $2.1M Notes (as well as other notes it currently holds as referenced above), together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, into shares at the applicable conversion price, at any time or from time to time prior to maturity. The conversion price is subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions. The $2.1M Notes also provide that at no time may they be convertible if the number of shares being issued upon conversion to and then held by the Institutional Investor would result in the Institutional Investor beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s then outstanding shares of common stock, after giving effect to the proposed conversion.
 
May 2017 Financing Agreement
 
On May 11, 2017, we entered into a second financing agreement with the Institutional Investor to provide the Company with up to an additional $5.8 million in convertible note funding (the “May 2017 Notes”) through July 31, 2018 (the “May 2017 Financing Agreement”). The May 2011 Financing Agreement was amended as of July 31, 2017, to increase the amount of funding available to the Company thereunder to $6.3 million and to extend the time period for such funding to May 31, 2019 and was subsequently amended as of November 15, 2017 and as of March 31, 2018, to further increase the amount of funding available to the Company thereunder to $7.75 million and to provide for the remaining $5.8million in principal amount of May 2017 Notes to be (a) convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at conversion prices ranging from $0.03 to $0.11 pursuant to the terms of each May 2017 Note as described below; and (b) to extend the time period for such funding to April 30, 2020.
 
Moreover, pursuant to an additional agreement reached as of March 31, 2018, KAYS and the Institutional Investor agreed that effective as of January 1, 2019, (a) the maturity date of all then outstanding Company promissory notes held by the Institutional Investor and its affiliate, NWP Finance LTD, will be extended from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020; (b) all of the $1.75 million in principal amount of May 2017 Notes currently outstanding and the remaining $5.8 million in principal amount of May 2017 Notes which may be issued under the Agreement, as amended, are to be secured by a mortgage lien on the Company’s 26-acre Lebanon, Oregon property, substantially similar in form and substance to the mortgage securing the $500,000 in principal amount of $0.03 Secured Notes purchased by the Institutional Investor, with the caveat that the property, improvements or rights to utilize them cannot be directly or indirectly leased, assigned or otherwise pledged to any entity without approval of the Institutional Investor, and in the event that there is a change in control of the Company or its subsidiaries the May 2017 Notes become immediately due and payable; and (c) the Institutional Investor will be granted piggy-back registration rights with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock it may hold or is issuable upon conversion of any Notes it or its Assigns may hold in the event the Company files a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended to sell shares of its common stock or permit the resale by shareholders of previously issued shares of common stock, up to a maximum of 30% of the shares registered under such registration statement.
 
Except as set forth above, the May 2017 Notes are substantially similar in form and substance to the $2.1M Notes that were part of the $2.1 million Financing Agreement entered into between the Company and the Institutional Investor in December 2016 and completed in March of 2017 (as well as the promissory notes evidencing approximately $1.2 million in financing previously received from the Institutional Investor in 2014 and 2015).
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Institutional Investor has purchased an aggregate of $1,750,000 in principal amount of May 2017 Notes from the Company under the May 2017 Financing Agreement, as amended to date, of which (a) $500,000 in principal amount of May 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.05 (the “$0.05Notes”); (b) $750,000 in principal amount of May 2017 Notes, which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.03 (the “$0.03Notes”); (c) $500,000 in principal amount of May 2017 Notes, which are (i) convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.03; and (ii) secured by a mortgage lien on the Company’s 26 acre Lebanon, Oregon property (the “$0.03 Secured Notes”).

Market Overview 
 
According to research firm Cowen & Co., legal cannabis sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $75 billion by 2030. The industry research firm Arcview, estimates a $22.6 billion legal cannabis market in North America by 2021, with 87% of all sales occurring in the United States. The Arcview forecast assumes a 27% compound annual growth rate, an assumption supported by current rates of growth, while reliant on additional states passing both recreational and medical cannabis laws.
 
Thirty states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana in some capacity. Additionally, eight states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington State) and the District of Colombia have approved the implementation of legal recreational marijuana use. The Marijuana Business Factbook 2017, published by industry news source Marijuana Business Daily, estimates that the legal marijuana sector will grow more than 300% from sales of $1.8 billion to $17.1 billion in 2021. The firm estimates that the economic impact of the legal cannabis industry will exceed $70 billion, placing it almost on par with nutraceuticals and ahead of movie tickets and retail ice cream. According to the Factbook, “to get another idea of just how big the marijuana industry has become, look to employment numbers. The cannabis sector now employs between 165,000-230,000 full and part-time workers….to put this in perspective, there are now more marijuana industry workers than there are bakers or massage therapists in the United States”.
 
Kaya Cares Cannabis Opioids Swap Program
 
In November 2017 the Company assisting in initiating a conversation on the role marijuana can play in addressing the opioid epidemic by announcing a willingness to implement Kaya Cares, an opioid – cannabis replacement program for current opioid prescription holders seeking to explore the efficacy of marijuana as a pain management substitute. The Company is proud to announce that its initiative was promoted online by a Now Weed Episode that gathered more than half a million views, attracted the support of minor celebrities, and reached the highest echelons of the Oregon State Government. The Company is further pleased to share that the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (“OLCC”) which is the State of Oregon’s marijuana licensing and regulatory authority, has opened a dialogue with local experts to explore legal and practical ways to use cannabis to alleviate some of the consequences of the opioid epidemic in Oregon. Kaya Holdings management has and will be participating in this critical dialogue and hopes to be part of the solution.

The Kaya Shack™ Brand
 



Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Shack™ brand of legal medical and recreational retail marijuana stores.
 
Kaya Holdings operates four recreational marijuana retail outlets and medical marijuana dispensaries in Oregon under the Kaya Shack™ brand. In addition to these four Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores, the Company plans to identify and lease locations for, license and seek to open up to four additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores in other Oregon markets over the next 18 to 24 months, as well as explore opportunities in other states to increase its retail footprint. Additionally, the Company is exploring opportunities to further its operation in Oregon and elsewhere through the acquisition of currently licensed and operating retail operations, which can be converted to the Kaya Shack™ model.
 
Dubbed by the mainstream press as the “Starbucks of Marijuana” after our first outlet opened in July 2014, our operating concept is simple to deliver a consistent customer experience (quality products, fair prices and superior customer service) to a broad and diverse base of customers. Kaya Shack™ meets the quality needs of the “marijuana enthusiast”, the comfort and atmosphere of all including “soccer moms” and the price sensitivities of casual smokers.
 
The Kaya Shack™ brand communicates positive thinking and joy, with signs adorning the walls that read “It’s a Good Day to have a Good Day,” “Some of our Happiest Days Haven’t Even Happened Yet,” and our signature “Be Kind.”
 
Kaya Shack™ retail outlets are open 7 days a week- Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm, and Sunday 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Operations follow an operational manual that details procedures for 18 areas of operation including safety, compliance, store opening, store closing, merchandising, handling of cash, inventory control, product intake, store appearance and employee conduct.
 
In compliance with regulations, all marijuana and marijuana infused products sold through our stores are quality tested by independent labs to assure adherence to strict quality and OLCC regulations.

I. Kaya Shack™, 1719 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Portland, Oregon
 







Our first Kaya Shack™ is in the heart of the trendy Hawthorne district in southeast Portland (the Greenwich Village of the West Coast). The store is located next door to a cell phone repair shop, and near to Devil’s Dill restaurant and No Fun pub. There are also a McMenamins restaurant, tattoo parlor, convenience store, hair/nail salon and a soccer sports bar. The area around the shop is mixed use (commercial and residential).

The first Kaya Shack™ is approximately 700 square feet and is the model for the Company’s small urban shops. The store features an 8’ display case showcasing at least 25 strains of marijuana flower, an additional 8’ display case with a varied selection of oils, concentrates and topicals, and a standing display case with edibles such as cookies, chocolates, gummies, hard candies and more. The store also has a hospitality area that offers free water, coffee, tea and hot cocoa. As required by law, all products containing marijuana are either behind locked glass or behind the counter and out of customer reach.
 

Our Portland outlet initially operated as an MMD. In connection with the transition of recreational marijuana retailer licenses from the OHA to the OLCC, we applied for an OLCC license for the facility in 2016. However, issuance of the OLCC license for the Portland, Oregon outlet was delayed because of the need to resolve various local issues with the City of Portland. Accordingly, from January 1, 2017 until May 2, 2017, when we received Kaya Shack TMOLCC Marijuana Retailer License #3 for this location, sales at the Portland, Oregon location were limited to medical marijuana and as such our revenues from this location were impacted.

Kaya Shack™ Home Delivery
 



In early February of 2017, the Company began the process of filing applications to add Home Delivery Service for three of its Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores at the advice of one of their OLCC examiners. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has received approvals from the OLCC to add Home Delivery to all four of its currently OLCC licensed locations.
 
In addition to providing added value and convenience for our customers, extending visibility and building brand recognition for the Kaya Shack™ brand, we believe that Home Delivery provides greater market penetration, by allowing sales throughout the geographic area that our stores are licensed in. There is no limit to the number of delivery vehicles that can service an individual area using just one store as a home base, so in effect we intend to use this service to construct additional “virtual” Kaya Shacks™ without the added costs of additional brick and mortar locations.
 
On April 11, 2017 the Company took delivery of its first four Fiat 500 cars to begin building their Kaya Car™ Home Delivery Service fleet. The cars have been customized with distinctive Kaya Shack™ vehicle wrapping featuring the Company’s branding logos and colors and outfitted with safes and security, and the Company is developing the Kaya Shack™ Delivery App for use by its customers to order “Fast, Free Delivery” of the complete line of both medical and recreational grade Kaya Shack™ cannabis products.
 
The Company intends to initiate its Kaya Car™ Home Delivery Service within the next 30 days, contemporaneously with a grand opening celebration for all four OLCC-Licensed Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores and to commence to move to the next stage of branding and retail development. The Company has reserved and is developing the website www.kayadelivers.com to advance the growth of its delivery service.

On March 21, 2017, KAYS announced that it was in the process of expanding its grow and manufacturing operations and had retained a realtor to assist in identifying a suitable acre tract of land in Oregon which would permit KAYS to expand its grow operations. As part of this expansion, KAYS ceased operations of its then existing Portland grow facility at the end of March 2017, arranged to maintain its genetics library of over 30 strains of cannabis at an OHA licensed medical grow site and contracted with farmers to meet demand until the new facility is secured, built and fully operational.
 



In August 2017, KAYS acquired a 26 acre parcel in Lebanon, Oregon, which KAYS intends to develop as a legal cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facility. KAYS believes that the acquisition of a property will position the Company for future development, including increased Marijuana Canopy production to the maximum extent allowed by law through use of both greenhouse and outdoor grows, as well as expansion of its production capabilities with brands in oils, vape cartridges, concentrates, a selection of edibles, and infused creams and lotions.

 Kaya Farms™ Pending Zoning Activity
 
On February 9, 2018 KAYS submitted a site plan review for the Company’s envisioned 101,000 square foot OLCC licensed Kaya Farms™ Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex and an application for a conditional use permit for marijuana processing on the Company owned 26.50-acre property zoned Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) with the Linn County, Oregon Planning and Building Department.



On March 9, 2018 the Company was notified by the Linn County, Oregon Planning and Building Department that the application was deemed complete and received an official letter of completeness with respect to the application. The formal “Letter of Completeness,” sent March 9, 2018 by a Linn County Senior Planner, confirmed the eligibility of the Company’s 26-acre plot for the purposes of growing legal cannabis, as well as the eligibility of the property for a special purpose exemption for the Company’s proposed manufacturing operations. The County has tentatively scheduled a decision on the application for April 20, 2018.

Kaya Farms™ - Cannabis and Cannabis Products
 
 Kaya Buddie™ Strain Specific Cannabis Cigarettes
 

In 2016 the Company introduced a signature line of strain-specific connoisseur-grade, pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes branded as “Kaya Buddies™”. Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes have been very well received by medical patients and recreational users, with the Company selling almost 100,000 Kaya Buddies™ since launching the brand in January 2016. The brand, marketed under the tagline “Buds with Benefits”, features over 50 different strains of connoisseur-grade, high quality cannabis and proprietary specialty blends. In early 2018 the Company set up a formal manufacturing center for the production of Kaya Buddies™ at its South Salem Kaya Shack Superstore (Kaya #2) and is in the process of completing remodeling there to showcase the production of their Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes to shoppers.

Other Potential Markets
 
We believe that revenues and profitability will be enhanced through our planned opening of additional retail outlets utilizing the Kaya Shack™ brand and model in our chain, as well as economies of scale achieved by being a multi-location retail chain and being vertically integrated with grow and manufacturing operations. Ultimately, we believe that we can successfully enter other markets as they open up by applying our “brand” retail chain and vertically integrated grow and manufacture model to other states that legalize recreational marijuana use. Where applicable, we will seek to leverage our public company status to finance organic growth and enable acquisitions of existing locations for the Kaya Shack brand, as well as look to acquire and grow additional brands.
 
The California recreational cannabis market is by far the largest potential market in the country, and our operations in Oregon allow for a natural progression and expansion down the I-5 corridor into California. Florida, should it become a recreational market, could be a potentially large market for us as well, because we believe that KAYS would have a distinct advantage in the state, as it is one of the few Florida-based entities whose management has significant experience in owning and operating retail dispensaries, a grow and manufacturing operations.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The Company has established a well-defined strategy for entering and maintaining a strong presence in the legal marijuana sector. The cornerstones of this strategy include:
 

· | All operations are to be conducted in accordance with State and Local Laws and Federal Enforcement Policies and Priorities as it relates to Marijuana (as outlined in the Justice Department's Cole Memo dated August 29, 2013, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions Memo dated January 4, 2018, and subsequent commentary from US Attorney for the District of Oregon Billy Williams). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will seek to operate in a vertically integrated manner (grow, process and sell) wherever permitted by law. In states where vertical integration is not permitted, the Company plans to determine which of the permitted activities offers the most potential for growth and value creation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will seek to engage, sponsor or lead local advocacy and lobbying groups that have a significant impact on the evolution and character of laws and the regulations under which legal marijuana operations are implemented in select markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company shall work with law enforcement and government officials to insure compliance with all regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company will only market its legal marijuana as in compliance with applicable state law.
 
The Company employs a marketing campaign consisting of four cornerstones:
 

· | Promoting and establishing the Kaya Shack™ brand.

· | A positive and active online presence.

 Government Regulation
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws directly applicable to our operations. As we continue to expand the scope of our operations, the application of existing laws and regulations could include matters such as pricing, advertising, consumer protection, quality of products, and intellectual property ownership. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities.
 
Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, which could hinder or prevent the growth of our business.
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our planned business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that additional or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations may be enacted in the future governing the legal marijuana industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations and its failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Competition
 
The legal marijuana sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of retail outlets, MMDs and grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, our Oregon operations have a total of 17 part-time store employees including budtenders, trimmers, growers, and 5 full-time employees, consisting of two store managers, a Sales and Marketing Coordinator, the Director of Dispensary and Grow Operations and a Master Grower.
