ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
On January 15, 2018, the registrant acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of PBG Water International Solutions, Inc. a Nevada corporation (“PBG”). PBG was organized to explore the market in the United States for wastewater treatment solutions and subsequently expanded its focus to markets outside the United States. On April 3, 2017, PBG entered into a License and Supply Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Beijing QHY Environment S&T Co. Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (the “Licensor”), pursuant to which PBG was granted the exclusive right to 21 patents and related technologies related to wastewater treatment solutions.
 
Organizational History
 
We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 16, 2007 under the name Rhino Productions, Inc. On September 13, 2011, we consummated a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Vast Glory Holdings Limited, pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Vast Glory in exchange for approximately 68% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. At the time of the acquisition, Vast Glory, through a series of wholly-owned subsidiaries, controlled the operations of and was entitled to receive the pre-tax profits of its variable interest entity, Changchun Decens Foods Co., Ltd. (“Decens Foods”), a PRC company. Thus, as a result of the acquisition of Vast Glory, we acquired the economic benefits of the operations of Decens Foods.
 
Effective December 14, 2011, we changed our corporate name to Yakun International and Investment Group.
 
In July 2014, we filed a Form 15 and elected to cease filing under the Exchange Act. Subsequently, on July 23, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Decens Foods and its shareholders relinquishing our interests in Decens Foods to its shareholders in China. Concurrently, we disposed of our interest in Vast Glory and hence, the entities owned by it. Consequently, as of July 31, 2014, we were once again a corporation with no business and minimal or nominal assets.
 
On January 15, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of PBG in exchange for 46,839,439 shares of common stock and 19,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated as of November 17, 2017 (The “Exchange Agreement”) with the former stockholders of PBG. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock and were so converted on April 18, 2018. PBG was the successor by merger to PBG Water International Solutions, Inc. a Delaware corporation which had been formed on August 4, 2016.

In addition to our acquisition of PBG, in December 2017 we formed QHY Water Solutions International Corp. a Nevada corporation (“QHY”). QHY permanently owned 51% of the capital stock of QHY New Zealand LLC. a Nevada limited liability company, and QHY Oceania S & T Co., Ltd., a New Zealand company. In October 2018, QHY transferred its ownership interested in QHY Oceania and QHY NZ to a non-affiliate for $100.
 
As a result of the disposition of Decens Foods, the acquisition of PBG and the formation of the subsidiaries mentioned above, our organizational structure is as follows as of December 31, 2018:
 

The acquisition of PBG was accounted for as a “reverse acquisition”, whereby PBG is the continuing entity for financial reporting purposes and was deemed, for accounting purposes, to be the acquirer of our company. Although we legally acquired PBG, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for accounting for a reverse acquisition, PBG’s historical financial statements are now the financial statements of the registrant and the assets and liabilities of Yakun have been brought forward at their historical book value and no goodwill has been recognized.
 
On May 14, 2018 we filed a registration statement on Form 10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), registering our common stock, as a result of which we became subject to all of the reporting obligations imposed by Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.
 
On July 31, 2018, we changed our corporate name to QHY Group.
 
Business Overview
 
On April 3, 2017, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Beijing QHY Environment S&T Co. Ltd. and Mr. Mao Xu, pursuant to which we acquired the exclusive right to 21 patents and related technologies for the treatment of wastewater. The License Agreement was amended in certain respects on June 22, 2017. The patents subject to the License as amended include two international patents and 19 Chinese national patents covering a variety of compositions, processes and equipment which can be used to treat wastewater. The agreement grants us the worldwide exclusive right to use the technologies which are the subject of the License for a term extending through June 30, 2037, or, if later, the last to expire of the patents which are the subject of the License. The patents relate to various powders, methodologies and equipment useful in the treatment of wastewater. The License requires that we pay a royalty equal to 1% of our net revenues, as defined in the License, with a one-time fee of $1million to be paid no later than December 31, 2021. Mao Xu, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is a significant shareholder of our Company and owns a majority of the outstanding shares of Beijing QHY Environment S&T Co. Ltd. (the “Beijing QHY”).
 
Although we entered into the License Agreement and an Amendment to the License Agreement, certain key provisions which should have been set forth on schedules to the License, including the specific products to be sold to us by QHY, the specifications for such products and trademarks to be developed by QHY which we will be permitted to use, have not been agreed upon and included in the License, in part because QHY continues to modify the products in response to the needs and requests of prospective customers. The parties will agree upon these provisions, including the price to be charged for each product, at the time products are ordered by customers.

We initially intended to recruit personnel in the United States to commence efforts to market solutions for the treatment of wastewater based upon the intellectual property acquired pursuant to the Licensing Agreement. These solutions include stand-alone processing plants designed to be transported, housed and maintained in standard shipping containers and mineral based powders used to treat the subject wastewaters. Commencing in late 2018, however, we began to explore the market for our products in New Zealand and Australia. We have successfully completed a trial of our methodologies on a poultry farm in New Zealand and anticipate commencing additional trials on a dairy farm and for other agricultural users. Despite the success achieved on the poultry farm, we have yet to consummate an agreement with the owner of the farm for the use of our products and methods.
 
In addition to licensing certain key technologies from Beijing QHY, we will likely purchase from Beijing QHY any equipment, supplies and other consumables ordered by our clients. The prices at which such items are acquired by us will be determined by negotiation between Beijing QHY and our directors.
 
The systems to be provided by PBG are based upon advanced principles associated with flocculation, coagulation and separation. The main ingredient, Yiyou ion separation purifier, is a natural mineral based powder that under the right conditions breaks the ionic bonds in organic and inorganic matters in wastewater. The substances then re-bond with positive and negative ions in Yiyou, causing the pollutants to cohere initially, into micro particles and, over a short time, into larger particles which fall to the bottom of the processing container allowing the “clean” water to be siphoned off for further treatment depending upon the desired quality of the end product. Because of the speed at which PBG’s systems can cleanse certain wastewater streams, it may be particularly useful in a variety of situations where the goal is not to purify the water to the point where it can be consumed by humans or animals but rather simply eliminate a sufficient quantity of the pollutants to allow the water to be recycled into river or lake or be reused in an industrial process.
 
The PBG systems have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of various streams of wastewater and, in PBG’s estimation, can economically be used to treat wastewater in a variety of industries as well as polluted lakes and ponds. To date, in addition to laboratory studies, we have conducted demonstrations in the field for potential customers. These have included the decentralized treatment of wastewater for a local government in Bazhou, Hebei Province, China; the treatment of sewage drains along the Suzhou River in Shanghai, China; the treatment of liquids pooled in a leachate refuse landfill in Henan Province, China; the treatment of industrial, shale wastewater, in Colorado, where our system was tested against that developed by Armada Water Assets; the treatment of wastewater generated by a mining operation in Kellogg, Idaho; and the treatment of the liquid discharge from a paper producing facility in Oklahoma. In each of these cases, the PBG system was shown to be effective in reducing the amount of pollutants in the effluent treated and PBG systems remain in operation in Shanghai and Hebei, China.
 
A principle advantage of the PBG system is that the processing plant has been designed to be housed in a standard international shipping container, allowing for easy transportation and installation. Once a container arrives at a designated site, there is little to do beyond hooking it up to a power source and adding the necessary connecting pipes. Systems can be scaled to meet a customer’s needs simply by adding more processing containers.
 
PBG envisions that its systems can be used in a variety of industries, such as industrial wastewater treatment where the pollutant is chemicals, heavy metals and mining runoff; sewage treatment and the purification of waste ponds typically found on industrial sized poultry, pork and cattle farms; residential wastewater treatment where the pollutants vary and can be combined with industrial wastes and rainwater runoff. Significantly, because of the portability and size of the basic processing plant, PBG’s systems can easily be combined with other common methods of treating wastewaters to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency.
 
PBG intends to offer customers their choice of whether to operate the systems on their own or to contract with PBG for a complete outsourced service. In each case, PBG will participate in the design of the system and the customization of the materials and dosing to be used to most economically treat the pollutants found in the customer’s wastewater. The patents and associated products we licensed from Mr. Mao and Beijing QHY enable us to provide comprehensive wastewater treatment solutions by applying an innovative wastewater treatment technology - Ion-Separation-Exchange Technology, to ensure that various wastewater reach the disposal standard after treatment.

We believe, based on our own observations and in part on a report issued by the China Society for Environmental Sciences in November 2015, that the technology underlying the PBG System is advanced in the sense that:
 

● | used on a standalone basis it effectively removes various water contaminants to meet dischargeable standards, but it can also could be combined with other water treatment technics, such as Biological Reduction, Reverse Osmosis, Permeable Reactive Barriers, etc., to meet more stringent requirements desired by a customer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the PBG system is generally less expensive than treatment systems using traditional polymeric flocculants - polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and polyacrylamide (PAM)- in that the capital investment required is less than that of traditional systems, the utility (power) costs are less than that of traditional systems and the footprint of a PBG system, a standardized shipping container if smaller than that associated with traditional systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the PBG system requires less time to remove pollutants than that required by traditional methods. This allows the PBG system to act as a nearly continuous flow system where the wastewater moves from one chamber to another within the “shipping container” as the pollutants drop to the bottom leaving a clear liquid at the top of the container to be siphoned off; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the PBG system can be housed in a mobile shipping container where multiple containers can be aggregated to form a larger unit. This allows for flexibility in design and reduced space needs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The active ingredient in the PBG system is a naturally occurring non-toxic mineral based powder that under the right conditions breaks the ionic bonds in organic and inorganic matters in wastewaters. The result is that the system produces two outputs – water to the desired purity and a non-hazardous odorless sludge which can easily be disposed. No secondary pollutant is created.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Market
 
The demand for clean pollutant free water continues to grow. As the supply of water is limited, the market for technologies designed to recapture contaminated water so that it can be recycled for industrial uses or purified for use as drinking water continues to expand. The processes employed to clean water range from simple gravity ponds to engineered chemical treatments. According to Hexa Research, the global water and wastewater treatment market was approximately $478 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to nearly $675 billion by 2025. A report issued by Global Water Intelligence at the Suez 2017 Education Day stated that the global market for industrial wastewater treatment was approximately $109 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach $132 billion by 2020.
Competition
 
The market for wastewater and industrial wastewater treatment can be divided by industry, the processing method used to treat the wastewater and whether the output is intended to be used for industrial purposes or human and animal consumption. Although there are certain well-known technologies employed across a variety of industries, often a customer requires an engineered solution unique to its needs and a number of technologies are combined to achieve the desired result. Consequently, the sales cycle is often long and tedious requiring one on one meetings at which the provider convinces the prospective customer of the benefits of its system. Given that adoption of a system often requires significant capital expenditures, customers are reluctant to switch to new, unproven systems. As a result, we intends to market its systems to entities first seeking to treat their wastewaters and in situations where it believes the portability and scalability of its processing system will prove advantageous.
 
There are numerous large, highly sophisticated and well financed engineering firms and other entities engaged in the design of water treatment facilities. Competitors range from those capable of designing, maintaining and operating large municipal water facilities, those dealing with the disposal needs of laboratories, hospitals and other medical facilities and those engaged in recycling water used on farms.
 
Regulation
 
Our existing and planned water operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, which govern the protection of the environment, health and safety, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. Our planned operations in other countries will be also subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that our solutions and products meet stringent performance criteria.

In the United States, these requirements include the United States Clean Water Act of 1972, which we refer to as the “Clean Water Act”. The Clean Water Act regulates discharges of wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant penalties and compliance costs. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. If we enter into operations of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, and public, we will be subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”).
 
International standards that will regulate our operation are established by such organizations as the International Code Council (ICC), the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), and the national regulatory standards that vary by country. For example, major standards and guidelines in European countries include Kiwa NV (Netherlands), Association Française de Normalisation (France), Swiss Gas and Water Industry Association (Switzerland), Water Regulations Advisory Scheme (UK), etc. New Zealand, a country in which we are in process of establishing businesses, established National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (Freshwater NPS) in 2014 that provides direction on how local authorities should carry out their responsibilities under the Resource Management Act 1991 for managing fresh water. New Zealand government amended Freshwater NPS in 2017 to a more stringent level of standards for dischargeable wastewater.
 
We also may be required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. Certain of these permits require substantial lead time to obtain and, once obtained, require that certain compliance tasks must be completed on a regular basis in order to maintain such permits.
 
In developing business opportunities, PBG has undertaken various trial wastewater treatment projects with potential customers, and independent certified institutions were engaged to assess the output of each project. In each case, the results met the regulatory standards the potential customer had targeted. The wastewater we ran trials on included the discharge from a lead-zinc mining operation, an industrial sized cattle farm, a paper mill, a polluted urban river, industrial park sewages, and an oil and gas field.
