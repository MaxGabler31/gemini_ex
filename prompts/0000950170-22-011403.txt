 Our Strengths
  Our core strengths include:
 •We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform.  We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages. We have tools and capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively to meet the unique needs of our customers. We believe that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve. We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to utilize our equipment. 
 •We are known for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders. The orders we receive are extremely complex. In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering 


documentation are as important as the equipment itself. We have developed order management capabilities to enable us to deliver high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment in a timely manner. For our customers’ complex, custom orders we typically manage very rigorous interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm, as product design and quality requirements are finalized. Customer supplier selection process begins by assessing these order management capabilities.
 •We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment. Our operations teams are experienced at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized solutions. We believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business. While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification. Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production. The markets we serve demand this flexible operating model.
 •We have the capability to manage outsourced production. Effectively accessing the global fabrication supply chain expands our market reach, increases execution capacity and can improve competitiveness. We use this capability for three primary reasons: 1. delivering a lower cost manufacturing option; 2. expanding capacity to execute an order to meet customer timing requirements; and 3. addressing localized content requirements. We have proven capability to deliver our specialized product designs with outsourced fabrication that is on-time, within budget and that meets our high quality standards.
 •We provide robust after-the-sale technical support. Our engineering and performance improvement personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues. Technical service after a sale is important to our customers as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize their facilities’ productivity.
 •We have a highly trained workforce. We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. We have been challenged by labor shortages in our local markets. To help offset this impact, we support the development of our employees through programs such as our internal weld school training and our partnerships with community colleges and other external weld training programs.
 •We have the unique capability to manufacture to tight tolerances. Our manufacturing abilities include the unique capability to fabricate large weldments with special metallurgy to tight tolerances. Additionally, we possess highly specialized manufacturing and electrochemical milling expertise on turbomachinery equipment that allows us to manufacture to tight tolerances. This, combined with our strong quality control with objective quality evidence, provides us a unique competitive advantage.
 Our Strategy
 
Our mission: Build Better Companies to Deliver Superior Performance. We currently have strategies that address our two operations which are in different phases of their business cycle.

For Graham Manufacturing in Batavia, which is in the midst of evolution and change, we are executing a four-step strategy as follows:
 1.Stabilize: We identified areas for process and system improvement and implemented a strengthened structure designed to enable strong execution and reduce risk. This included a reorganization and alignment of key management positions, and the addition of a new Director of Sales, Director of Navy Operations and Navy supervisors, Director of Commercial Operations, Human Resource Manager, and Chief Financial Officer. During this period, we have had positive communication with our key customers that have expressed support for our changes and progress. 
 2.Improve: We have defined a roadmap to improve our operations, which is driven by better information flow and accountability. We are focused on improving returns in our target markets by driving operational effectiveness and developing capabilities to provide more value to our customers. Priorities will be on business visibility and analysis, new products, enhanced service and support, cost effective manufacturing and engineering, and employee recruitment and engagement.
 3.Grow: With a large installed base, we expect to leverage our vacuum and heat transfer expertise to grow over time into a larger and more profitable business.
 4.Mature to Full Lifecycle Product Strategy: This covers the spectrum from customer collaboration in developing markets to investing in and executing production and service programs. 


   Our near and mid-term strategy for BN focuses on continued development and growth to deliver on our long-term goal of achieving a full lifecycle product strategy. Elements include:
 1.Nurture customer partnerships in developing industries such as alternative energy: We will pursue opportunities with customers in leading positions in their markets where we can develop technology that is scalable and leverageable across high compliance, leading edge applications.
 2.Validate customized solutions in new applications: We will foster early relationships with customers and pursue opportunities in pre-specification phases. We will develop customized solutions with extensive validation to “lock-in” long term production. Our emphasis is on requirements management and proving compliance.
 3.Develop disruptive products and technologies for currently served markets: Pursue opportunities that benefit from disruptive solutions and require full life cycle support including aftermarket. Our emphasis is on system analysis trade studies and product family design.
 4.Invest in and execute to win production and service programs: Execute high compliance production programs with excellence and quick response to earn additional opportunities. Proactively offer tangible solutions to known supply or technical issues. Our emphasis is on Design for Manufacturing, Assembly, Inspection & Test and continual improvement.
 
Executed effectively, we believe our strategies will create more enduring, recurring opportunities and profitable growth.

Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We also depend heavily on the brand recognition of the Graham name in the marketplace.
Availability of Raw Materials
 Historically, we have not been materially adversely impacted by the availability of raw materials. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic and supply chain disruptions, we have seen upward pricing pressure on parts and raw materials. This has also resulted in increased operational challenges from workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at our customers and suppliers, leading to increases in prices and freight costs. As discussed more fully in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report, the raw materials that we source come from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial results. Disruptions in our supply chain, especially for an extended period of time, could impact our ability to meet customer requirements and our financial performance could be materially and adversely impacted.
Inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally due in part to global supply chain issues, a rise in energy prices, labor shortages, and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen from restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inflationary environment has increased the cost of our raw materials and labor which impacted our financial results, especially given that a large percentage of our contracts are fixed price in nature. To help mitigate this risk, we place orders for raw materials when the purchase orders are received from the customer to lock-in raw material pricing.
Working Capital Practices
 Our business does not require us to carry significant amounts of inventory or materials beyond what is needed for work in process. We negotiate progress payments from our customers on our large projects to finance costs incurred. We do not provide rights to return goods, or payment terms to customers that we consider to be extended in the context of the industries we serve. We do provide for warranty claims, which historically have not had a material impact on our results of operations.
Government and Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in numerous jurisdictions within the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business. These laws, rules and regulations cover several diverse areas including environmental matters, employee health and safety, data and privacy protection, and anti-trust provisions. We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with governmental regulations did not have a material impact on our financial results during fiscal 2022, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 We believe that a focus on environmental stewardship is fundamental and integral to the work we do every day to serve our customers, create value for our stockholders, and benefit our global community. We have taken steps at both our business units in Batavia, New York and Arvada, Colorado to improve energy efficiencies and air quality that are intended to lessen our impact on the environment. We do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Due to risks in these areas, we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.
Seasonality
 No material part of our business is seasonal in nature. However, our energy business is highly cyclical in nature as it depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in major capital projects. To help mitigate this risk, we have taken steps to diversify our business into the defense industry including the acquisition of BN. For fiscal 2022, sales to the defense industry accounted for 51% of our total sales compared to 25% for the twelve month period ending March 31, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021"). Conversely, sales to the refining industry, which are more cyclical in nature, represented 20% of revenue in fiscal 2022 compared to 41% in fiscal 2021.
Research and Development Activities
 During fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"), we spent $3,845, $3,367 and $3,353, respectively, on research and development ("R&D") activities. The majority of our R&D is funded by our customers and is specific to help solve our customers’ problems in order to improve efficiencies, address challenging environments or caustic materials, or redesign for form and function. Additionally, we may be engineering new products and services for our customers. We also continually look to improve existing products and services.
Human Capital Resources
 As of March 31, 2022, we had 491 employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
 At Graham, we believe our most important asset is our people. We are committed to fostering and embracing a Graham community in which employees share a mutual understanding and respect for each other. Our pledge to diversity and equality encompasses our commitment to create a work environment which embraces inclusion regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, genetic information, marital status, amnesty, pregnancy, childbirth, disability, veteran status, or medical conditions.
•Diversity: Our Management recognizes that a diverse workforce and a culture of equity and inclusion helps us compete more effectively, sustain success, and build long-term shareholder value. We encourage every one of our team members to form deeper relationships with those around them based on mutual respect, dignity, and understanding. 
 •Engagement: to encourage productive conversations within our organization, we have implemented employee surveys. 
 •Development: We believe that employee development is vital to our continued success, and we support the development of our employees through programs such as our internal weld school training, our partnerships for external weld training, our tuition assistance program, and management training classes.
 •Health and Safety: We are dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our team members by supporting the whole person. Our dedicated global health and safety function is executed through our business unit safety committees to ensures that employees are trained on best practices to create a safe and healthy workplace for all.
