ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
General Description of Business, Offering and Structure
 
The Lightstone REIT III is a Maryland corporation, formed on October 5, 2012, which elected to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015.
 
The Lightstone REIT III is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).
 
Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 
 
We currently have one operating segment. As of December 31, 2017, we majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of 9 limited service hotels containing a total of 999 rooms. Additionally, we held a 22.5% membership interest in RP Maximus Cove, L.L.C. (the “Cove Joint Venture”), which we account for under the equity method of accounting.
 
Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of our sponsor, The Lightstone Group, LLC (the ‘‘Sponsor’’). Our Advisor, together with our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), is and will continue to be primarily responsible for making investment decisions and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner of the Advisor and the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC (the “Special Limited Partner”), which has subordinated participation interests (“Subordinated Participation Interests”) in the Operating Partnership. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership.
 
We do not have and will not have any employees that are not also employed by our Sponsor or its affiliates. We depend substantially on our Advisor, which generally has responsibility for our day-to-day operations. Under the terms of the advisory agreement, the Advisor also undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to present to us investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives as adopted by our Board of Directors.

The Company’s registration statement on Form S-11 (the “Offering”), pursuant to which it offered to sell up to 30,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which may be referred to herein as ‘‘shares of common stock’’ or as ‘‘Common Shares’’) for an initial price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts (the “Primary Offering”) (exclusive of 10,000,000 shares available pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) at an initial purchase price of $9.50 per share) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933 on July 15, 2014. On June 30, 2016, the Company adjusted the offering price to $9.50 per Common Share in its Primary Offering, which was equal to the Company’s estimated net asset value (“NAV”) per Common Share as of March 31, 2016, and effective July 25, 2016, the Company’s offering price was adjusted to $10.00 per Common Share in its Primary Offering, which was equal to the estimated NAV per Common Share as of June 30, 2016. Our estimated NAV per Common Share remained unchanged at $10.00 as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016.
 
Orchard Securities, LLC (“Orchard Securities”) was the Dealer Manager of the Company’s Offering through its termination on March 31, 2017. Orchard Securities has a branch office that does business as “Lightstone Capital Markets” and focused primarily on distributing interests in programs sponsored by our Sponsor.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Advisor owned 20,000 shares of common stock which were issued on December 24, 2012 for $200,000, or $10.00 per share.
 
The Offering, which terminated on March 31, 2017, raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $131.7 million from the sale of approximately 13.4 million shares of common stock (including $2.0 million in Common Shares at a purchase price of $9.00 per Common Share to an entity 100% owned by David Lichtenstein, who also owns a majority interest in the Company’s Sponsor). After including the purchase of an aggregate of $12.1 million of Subordinated Participation Interests by the Special Limited Partner and allowing for the payment of approximately $12.2 million in selling commissions and dealer manager fees and $4.8 million in organization and other offering expenses, the Offering generated aggregate net proceeds of approximately $126.8 million.
 
On April 21, 2017, the Company’s board of directors approved the termination of the DRIP effective May 15, 2017. Previously, the Company’s stockholders had an option to elect the receipt of shares of the Company’s common stock in lieu of cash distributions under the Company’s DRIP, however, all future distributions will be in the form of cash. In addition, through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), the Company had issued approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock under its DRIP, representing approximately $3.2 million of additional proceeds under the Offering.
 
The Company invested the proceeds received from the Offering and the Advisor in the Operating Partnership, and as a result, held a 99% general partnership interest as of December 31, 2017 in the Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
The Company’s shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of its independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its shares of common stock at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any market for its shares of common stock until they are listed for trading. In the event the Company does not begin the process of achieving a liquidity event prior to the eighth anniversary of the termination of our Offering, our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio.
 
Noncontrolling Interest – Partners of Operating Partnership
 
On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2,000 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. A limited partner has the right to convert operating partnership units into cash or, at the option of the Company, an equal number of common shares of the Company, as allowed by the limited partnership agreement.

The Special Limited Partner committed to make a significant equity investment (the “Contribution Agreement”) in the Company of up to $36.0 million, which was equivalent to 12.0% of the $300.0 million maximum amount of Common Shares under the Offering, which terminated on March 31, 2017. The Operating Partnership issued one Subordinated Participation Interest for each $50,000 in cash or interests in real property of equivalent value that the Special Limited Partner contributed. In connection with the termination of the Offering, on March 31, 2017, the Company and the Sponsor terminated the Contribution Agreement and as result of the termination, the Sponsor is no longer obligated to purchase any additional Subordinated Participation Interests.
 
Through March 31, 2017 (the termination date of the Offering), the Special Limited Partner purchased an aggregate of approximately 242 Subordinated Participation Interests in consideration of $12.1 million. The Subordinated Participation Interests may be entitled to receive liquidation distributions upon the liquidation of Lightstone REIT III.
 
Operations - Operating Partnership Activity
 
Our Operating Partnership commenced its operations on December 11, 2014. Since then we have and will continue to seek to primarily acquire and operate hospitality properties and to a lesser extent, commercial and residential properties principally in North America through our Operating Partnership. Our commercial holdings may consist of full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels and to a lesser extent, retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. In addition, we may invest up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly.
 
The following summarizes our completed acquisitions through December 31, 2017:

The Cove Joint Venture
 
On January 31, 2017, we, through a subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, REIT III COVE LLC (“REIT III Cove”) and REIT IV COVE LLC (“REIT IV Cove”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“Lightstone IV”), a real estate investment trust also sponsored by our Sponsor and a related party, collectively, the “Assignees”, entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the “Assignment”) with another of Lightstone IV’s wholly owned subsidiaries, REIT COVE LLC (the “Assignor”). Under the terms of the Assignment, the Assignees were assigned the rights and obligations of the Assignor with respect to that certain Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated September 29, 2016, made between the Assignor, as the purchaser, LSG Cove LLC (“LSG Cove”), an affiliate of our Sponsor and a related party and Maximus Cove Investor LLC (“Maximus”), an unrelated third party (collectively, the “Buyer”) and an unrelated third party, RP Cove, L.L.C (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Buyer will acquire the Seller’s membership interest in the Cove Joint Venture for approximately $255.0 million (the “Cove Transaction”). The Cove Joint Venture owns and operates The Cove at Tiburon (“The Cove”), a 281-unit, luxury waterfront multifamily rental property located in Tiburon, California. Prior to entering into the Cove Transaction, Maximus previously owned a separate noncontrolling interest in the Cove Joint Venture.
 
On January 31, 2017, REIT IV Cove, REIT III Cove, LSG Cove, and Maximus (the “Members”) completed the Cove Transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately $255.0 million, which consisted of $80.0 million of cash and $175.0 million of proceeds from a loan from a financial institution to the Cove Joint Venture. We paid approximately $20.0 million for a 22.5% membership interest in the Cove Joint Venture. In connection with the acquisition, we paid our Advisor an acquisition fee of $573,750, equal to 1.0% of our pro-rata share of the contractual purchase price.
 
Our ownership interest in the Cove Joint Venture is a non-managing interest. We have determined that the Cove Joint Venture is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and because we exert significant influence over but do not control the Cove Joint Venture, we will account for our ownership interest in the Cove Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting. All distributions of earnings from the Cove Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each Members’ equity interest percentage. Any distributions in excess of earnings from the Cove Joint venture are made to the Members pursuant to the terms of the Cove Joint Venture’s operating agreement. An affiliate of Maximus is the asset manager of The Cove and receives certain fees as defined in the Property Management Agreement for the management of The Cove. We commenced recording our allocated portion of earnings and cash distributions beginning as of January 31, 2017 with respect to our membership interest of 22.5% in the Cove Joint Venture.
 
In connection with the closing of the Cove Transaction, the Cove Joint Venture simultaneously entered into a $175.0 million loan (the “Loan”) scheduled to mature on January 31, 2020 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Loan requires monthly interest payments through its maturity date.  The Loan bears interest at Libor plus 3.85% through its initial maturity and Libor plus 4.15% during each of the extension periods. The Loan is collateralized by The Cove and an affiliate of our Sponsor (the “Guarantor”) has guaranteed the Cove Joint Venture‘s obligation to pay the outstanding balance of the Loan up to approximately $43.8 million (the “Loan Guarantee”). The Members have agreed to reimburse the Guarantor for any balance that may become due under the Loan Guarantee, of which our share is up to approximately $10.9 million.
 
The Cove is a multi-family complex consisting of 281-units, or 289,690 square feet, contained within 32 apartment buildings over 20.1 acres originally constructed in 1967.
 
Starting in 2013, the Cove has been undergoing an extensive refurbishment which is substantially completed. The Members have and intend to continue to use the remaining proceeds from the Loan and to invest additional capital if necessary to complete the remainder of the refurbishment. The Guarantor has provided an additional guarantee of up to approximately $13.4 million (the “Refurbishment Guarantee”) to provide any necessary funds to complete the remaining renovations as defined in the Loan. The Members have agreed to reimburse the Guarantor for any balance that may become due under the Refurbishment Guarantee, of which our share is up to approximately $3.3 million.
 
Related Parties
 
Our Advisor and its affiliates and the Special Limited Partner are related parties of the Company. Certain of these entities have or will receive compensation and fees for services related to our offerings and will continue to receive compensation and fees and services for the investment and management of our assets. These entities have received and/or will receive fees during our offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during our offering, acquisition and operational stages are based on percentages of the offering proceeds sold, the cost of acquired properties and the annual revenue earned from such properties, and other such fees outlined in each of the respective agreements.

Primary Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk.
 
Acquisition and Investment Policies 
 
We have and intend to continue to primarily acquire full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities including restaurants, concierge and room service, porter service or valet parking. Select-service hotels typically do not include these amenities. Extended-stay hotels offer upscale, high-quality, residential style lodging with a comprehensive package of guest services and amenities for extended-stay business and leisure travelers. We have no limitation as to the brand of franchise or license with which our hotels will be associated.
 
Even though we have and intend to continue primarily to acquire hotels, we have and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We have and expect to invest mainly in direct real estate investments and other equity interests; however, we may also invest in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk.
 
We expect that our portfolio will provide consistent current income and may also provide capital appreciation resulting from our expectation that in certain circumstances we have or will be able to acquire properties at a discount to replacement cost or otherwise at less than what we perceive as the market value or to reposition or redevelop a property so as to increase its value over the amount of capital we deployed to acquire and rehabilitate the property. We have and may continue to acquire properties that we believe would benefit from a change in management strategy, or that have incurred substantial deferred maintenance. We have and plan to continue to diversify our portfolio by geographic region, investment size and investment risk with the goal of owning a portfolio of hotels and other income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets that provide attractive returns for our investors.
 
Our Advisor has and intends to focus on markets that may be depressed or overbuilt and on sellers who are distressed or time-constrained. Our opportunistic real estate strategy involves more risk than real estate programs that have a targeted holding period for investments longer than ours, utilize leverage to a lesser degree or employ more conservative investment strategies, and, based upon these factors and the experience of our Sponsor we believe that we have a potential for a higher rate of return than comparable real estate programs. The exact markets that will ultimately be targeted by our Advisor will depend on its evaluation of property prices and other economic considerations impacting the particular markets.
 
As part of our opportunistic real estate investment strategy, we have and expect to continue to acquire hotels with low occupancy rates and reposition them by seeking to improve the property and occupancy rates and thereby increase average daily rates, revenue per available room and overall property value. Further, we have and expect to continue to invest in hotels that we believe present an opportunity for enhanced future value because of delayed renovations or deferred maintenance that we believe we can remedy.
 
We have and expect to continue to purchase properties that have been constructed and have operating histories; additionally, we may acquire properties that are newly constructed, under development or construction or not yet developed. Properties may include multifamily properties purchased for conversion into condominiums or cooperatives, ground leases and properties intended to be converted from one use to another use. Additionally, subject to applicable REIT requirements, as a property reaches a market value that would provide what our Advisor believes to be an attractive return to our investors given the then prevailing market conditions, we will consider disposing of the property and may do so for the purpose of distributing the net sale proceeds to our stockholders. We anticipate that such dispositions typically would occur during the period from three to six years after the termination of the Offering. However, subject to provisions of the Code relating to “prohibited transactions,” we may consider investing in properties with a different anticipated holding period in the event such properties provide an opportunity for an attractive overall return. For example, we may acquire properties in markets that are depressed or overbuilt with the anticipation that, within our anticipated holding period, the markets will recover and favorably impact the value of these properties. In addition, we may acquire interests in other entities with similar real property investments or investment strategies. We have and expect to continue to make our investments in real estate assets located in the United States and its territories.

Subject to the applicable REIT requirements, to the extent that our Advisor determines that it is advantageous, we may originate or invest in real estate-related assets such as mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans and debt and equity securities issued by other real estate companies. In each case, these real estate-related assets will have been identified as being opportunistic investments with significant possibilities for near-term capital appreciation or higher current income; however, we intend to limit these types of investments so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
We have and may continue to enter into joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties with third parties or certain affiliates of our Advisor, including other present and future REITs and real estate limited partnerships sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor.


Financing Strategy and Policies
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest or borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total “net assets” (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.
 
We do not currently intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.
 
Distribution Objectives

U.S. federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to qualify or continue to qualify for REIT status, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available.
 
Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. Such analyses may include actual and anticipated operating cash flow, capital expenditure needs, general financial and market conditions, proceeds from asset sales and other factors that our board of directors deem relevant. Our Board of Directors’ decisions will be substantially influenced by their obligation to ensure that we maintain our federal tax status as a REIT. We have and may continue to fund distributions with cash proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock or borrowings if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund distributions. Our ability to pay regular distributions and the amount of distributions will depend upon a variety of factors. For example, our borrowing policy permits us to incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less, and we may have to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We cannot assure that regular distributions will continue to be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have established or may establish.

We are an accrual basis taxpayer, and as such our REIT taxable income could be higher than the cash available to us. We may therefore borrow to make distributions, which could reduce the cash available to us, in order to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income as a condition to our election to be taxed as a REIT. These distributions made with borrowed funds may constitute a return of capital to stockholders. “Return of capital” refers to distributions to investors in excess of net income. To the extent that distributions to stockholders exceed earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but only to the extent of a stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in our shares, although such distributions might not reduce stockholders’ aggregate invested capital. Because our earnings and profits are reduced for depreciation and other non-cash items, it is likely that a portion of each distribution will constitute a tax-deferred return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
On January 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized and we declared a distribution which is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00164383 per day, and equals a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal a 6.0% annualized rate based on a share price of $10.00. Our first distribution began to accrue on December 11, 2014 (date of breaking escrow for our offering) through February 28, 2015 (the end of the month following our initial property acquisition) and subsequent distributions have been declared on a monthly basis thereafter. The first distribution was paid on March 15, 2015 and subsequent distributions have been paid on or about the 15th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the prior month.
 
On April 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the DRIP effective May 15, 2017. Previously, our stockholders had an option to elect the receipt of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash distributions under the DRIP, however, all future distributions will be in the form of cash. In addition, through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), we issued approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock under the DRIP, representing approximately $3.2 million of additional proceeds under the Offering.
 
Total distributions declared during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $8.0 million and $4.7 million.
 
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Repurchase Programs 
 
On April 21, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the termination of our DRIP effective May 15, 2017. All future distributions will be in the form of cash.
 
Our DRIP provided our stockholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares of our common stock, at a discount by reinvesting their distributions. The Offering provided for 10.0 million shares available for issuance under our DRIP which were offered at a discounted price equivalent to 95% of our Primary Offering price per Common Share. Through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP) 339,835 shares of common stock had been issued under our DRIP.
 
Our share repurchase program may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions. From inception through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 34,358 shares of common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase program. We repurchased the shares at an average price per share of $9.99 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 47,469 shares of common stock have been repurchased under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of $9.60 per share. We funded share repurchases for the periods noted above from the cumulative proceeds of the sale of our shares pursuant to our DRIP.
 
Our Board of Directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders. Our Board of Directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders or to reject any request for repurchase and there is no assurance our Board of Directors will not suspend or terminate the program or reject requests for repurchases.
 
Tax Status
 
We elected to qualify and be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

We engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). When we purchase a hotel we establish a TRS which enters into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we may be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
 
To qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs. As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
Competition

The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and rental revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels will be located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry will increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We will also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we will not be associated.
 
We have or may compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
 
In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of proceeds from our Offering in desirable assets, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability to commence or maintain distributions to stockholders.
 
We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.

Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the hospitality industry and any industries in which we may operate to offer existing property owners the opportunity to contribute their properties to us in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.

As an owner of real estate, we are and will be subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees

We do not have employees. We have entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate-related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We have and will continue to pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we have and will continue to reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.
Economic Dependence

We were initially dependent upon the net proceeds received from our Offering to conduct our proposed activities. The capital required to acquire additional real estate and real estate related investments may be obtained from the proceeds from the remaining proceeds from our Offering, proceeds from asset sales and/or from any financings.
