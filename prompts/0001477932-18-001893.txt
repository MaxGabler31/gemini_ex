Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on July 22, 2002 in the State of Nevada under the name Bibb Corporation. On September 3, 2010, we changed our name to Z3 Enterprises, Inc. ("Z3"), and on April 5, 2012, to HPEV, Inc. ("HPEV") and on August 19. 2015 our stockholders voted to approve a name change to Cool Technologies, Inc. Our 95% owned subsidiary, Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ("UPT"), was formed on April 17, 2014 in the State of Florida.
 
On March 29, 2011, we entered into a share exchange agreement (which was amended on June 14, 2011) with HPEV, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("the Share Exchange Agreement") to acquire 100 shares, constituting all of the issued and outstanding shares of HPEV, Inc. in consideration for the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock. Upon closing of the share exchange on April 15, 2011, HPEV, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. There was a change of control of our company on April 15, 2011 as a result of the issuance of 21,880,000 shares of our common stock to the original shareholders of HPEV, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. An additional 120,000 shares were issued during the fourth quarter of 2011 which completed the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock under the terms of the amended Share Exchange Agreement. 
 
As of April 10, 2018, we have seven US patents, one granted Mexican patent, four pending applications (2 in Canada, 1 in Brazil, 1 US) and one US filed provisional application pending in the area of composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, applications (commonly referred to as "thermal" or "heat dispersion technology") and a parallel power vehicle platform system. We also have Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") applications filed for a heat pipe cooled brake system, a parallel power input gearing system (PPIG) and radial vent thermal technology.
 
The Company intends to commercialize its patents by licensing its thermal technologies and applications to electric motor, pump and vehicle component manufacturers and by licensing or selling a mobile electric power system powered by the Company's proprietary gearing system to commercial vehicle and fleet owners.
 
On October 7, 2016, our Board of Directors and the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Stock of the Company representing 66 2/3% of the voting stock of the Company adopted resolutions which authorized the Company to act on a proposal to effect a reverse stock split on the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on a 15:1 basis. 
 
We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. We currently believe that the increase in authorized share capital eliminates the need for any other type of corporate action such as a reverse stock split.

Our Technologies
 
Our technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: heat dispersion technology and mobile power generation (MG).
 
Heat Dispersion Technology
 
Heat is an undesirable byproduct of anything that moves, especially motors and generators. Historically, a large percentage of the cost of manufacturing any motor has been in the technology necessary to remove heat during its operation to prevent failure and increase power. Heat can destroy motors, generators and many other types of machinery, and the energy necessary to remove heat can limit output.
 
Our patented thermal dispersion technology removes heat via composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture. Heat pipes have been utilized for more than 50 years, but we have a proprietary process and design technology that makes our heat pipes usable in many applications that have previously not been effective. The key is that our heat pipes move heat in any direction in a system that requires little or no maintenance and can be applied to almost any motor, generator or industrial product. We believe that this allows for more efficient, smaller, and higher output machines, resulting in cooler motors and a longer operating life.
 
Our patent portfolio covers the application and integration of our heat pipes into various cooling schemes for enhanced heat removal in motors, generators and numerous other industrial applications including marine, aviation and military. We believe that our technologies have the potential to deliver power output increases and cost reductions, depending on the machine type or motor/generator size, as follows:
 

1. | Increase power density of current motor platforms by 20% to 40%,
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Reduce total product cost by 12.5% to 25%, 
3. | Increase motor and generator efficiency by 1% to 2%, and 
4. | Increase motor and generator life. 

 
We also believe that products produced with our technologies have the potential to deliver operational savings as well, including savings from:
 

- | reduced maintenance costs, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | the standardization of multiple platforms down to a single platform, 
- | the standardization of drawings and data around existing platforms, 
- | the ability to use standard designs and standard insulation systems versus customization, and 
- | the ability to integrate and produce on existing production lines with no retooling and no additional, or minimal, capital investment.

Recent tests by independent laboratories showed a 200% increase in horsepower capability for a dry pit submersible pump and a 25 to 35% increase in power density for a 650 kVA alternator. 
 
On December 6, 2013, ESSCO Pumps and Controls, a member of the Hydraulic Institute, conducted the tests in accordance with standards set forth by the Institute. The tests examined the tolerances of an industrial electric motor in an extreme situation. The tolerances determine the amount of power that can be driven through pumps run by the motor and are a strong predictor of the maintenance and other service downtime the pump will require. The original pump motor is rated to run, without submersion, for up to 15 minutes before the pump's protective circuits will turn it off to prevent overheating. This heat limitation restricts the output of the motor. The test pump used the same industrial electric motor, except with Cool Tech's thermal dispersion technology incorporated. The result: the test pump ran without submersion for more than two hours at or above full power without reaching critical temperatures that would have caused an automatic shutdown. 
 
On December 13, 2013, Mohler Technology, Inc. of Boonville, Indiana completed tests of an alternator enhanced with our thermal technology. A 650kVA alternator (generator) was run at full load to test its operational limits. The heat produced by generators of that size must be removed or controlled in order for the alternator to operate effectively. Manufacturers' current best practice is to add either a liquid cooling system or an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of the generators. 
 
The alternator tested used our thermal technology with no other cooling of any kind. The results showed a minimum of 25% improvement in power density over the manufacturer's rating for the alternator when operating without water cooling. In fact, the alternator achieved power densities comparable to a liquid-cooled or over-framed one.
 
The tests confirmed our belief that our heat pipe cooling system equals the effectiveness of a more complex water-cooled system. Extrapolating the results leads us to believe that simple designs incorporating our thermal technology combined with the increase in potential output will result in lower costs to manufacture by reducing the amount of material needed to produce a product with a specific output.
 
In October 2015, Kato Engineering, a business unit of Nidec, conducted two heat run tests. The tests were performed at a 0.8 power factor and tested rated load temperature using the Emerson LS 625KVA generator with and without our heat dispersion system. Our results were then compared with results of tests performed at a 0.8 power factor using the generator's standard-issue, totally-enclosed, water-to-air cooled (TEWAC) system.
 
A comparison of all test results produced by the various testing agencies revealed a minor variance in some readings. A plan has been designed to optimize our technology to produce consistent results within a specific parameter. We believe this should enable an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to offer our technology as an option. 
 


6

 
The successful testing also represents a significant advance in our product development agreements with manufacturing partners. We anticipate that we will begin to enter into license agreements upon completion of the required design refinements and field testing to industry or governmental standards. At this point, the product will be ready to be manufactured on the licensee's regular production line. Any additional field tests will be at the discretion of the licensee.
 
We also plan to incorporate heat pipes in vehicle components which generate heat such as brake calipers, resistors and rotors. The new brake components should be incorporated in upfitted vehicles when revenues justify their testing and production. 
 
Our revenue model for the heat dispersion technology is to license the technology in exchange for royalties.
 

Thermal Technology Target Markets: Generators
---------------------------------------------
Large kilowatt: | prime power 
Stationary: | emergency back-up 
Commercial Mobile: | construction, utilities, mining, drilling
Consumer: | home standby, recreation 
Rental: | mobile + light towers, pumps, compressors

Mobile Power Generation (MG)
 
The Company has a proprietary gearing system, which is used to power an on-board generator, eliminating the need for some commercial vehicles to tow a mobile generator to a work site. Management believes that there is a need for on-board, continuous generation of up to 200 kilowatts (kW) of power to remote jobsites, as well as mobile generation of emergency power in the event of an outage or disaster. We intend to offer an on-board generator installation kit as a stand-alone (Mobile Generator) for third parties and as part of an in-house brand (Ultimate Work Truck).
 
Management, along with key directors and members of the Board of Advisors utilized 2017 to establish production centers, sign supplier agreements, (Craftsmen Industries, Veteran Technology Group, and Czero, Inc.) interview prospective customers and generate 269 sales commitments which confirmed revenues for the Company. The company also increased electrical output for the MG, added new technical capabilities, finalized data packs, models and schematics to enable third party up-fitting, and defined the steps of the purchase cycle which will based upon the Six Sigma innovation sales process. We currently intend to launch our MG30-MG125 products in the first half of 2018. 
 
In the first quarter of 2017, we provided the first public demonstration of a 30 kilovolt amp (kVA) MG system at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. In the second quarter, we broadcast a live Internet stream of our demonstration from Craftsman Industries and, followed that with appearance in the parade associated with the Kentucky Derby.
 
Our revenue model for Mobile Generation will be driven by the efforts of partner up-fitters and truck body builders along with regional sales teams and independent representatives.
 
We believe that in head-to-head competition with tow behind generators, our mobile generation technology should prove very disruptive. Operators in such markets as utility, telecom and tree service, to name a few, will be able to work in remote locations without having to tow or drop in a generator. We believe that the reduction in overall weight and size should also deliver significant operating efficiencies and savings to work truck fleets.

Weight of 55 kW tow behind: 6,367 lbs. | Weight of Cool Tech 55 kW MG System: 1,005 lbs.

Competition
 
Heat Dispersion Technology
 
Cooling solutions to remove or control heat produced by industrial electric motors, generators and alternators are provided by the manufacturers. Their current best practices are based on technology that's over 50 years old. They either add a liquid cooling system to the motor or build an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of their products. 
 
The Company is not aware of any new alternatives on the market.
 
Mobile Electric Power (MG30-MG200)

Management believes that the Company can compete in the mobile electric power market because there is a need for on-board generators, as opposed to trailer-mounted generators towed behind a vehicle. A primary benefit will be that the under-chassis installation will allow a truck to tow other trailers and equipment, however, we anticipate that the greatest selling point will be value. In comparison to the purchase price of a new Doosan towable generator, we believe we can provide up to 200 kilowatts ("kW") of auxiliary mobile power to any location for less than half the production cost of a towable, trailer-mounted generator, which may weigh over 10,000 pounds. We intend to deliver the same power at under 3,000 pounds. Our Mobile Generation system will also offer the same features of a tow behind generator including single and three phase outputs as well as a full function generator panel with enhanced capabilities including a touchscreen, digital controls and optional telematics.

Our target markets will initially center on industries and entities that rarely or never unhook their tow-behind generators from their work trucks. In industry parlance, they are always plugged in.
 

Mobile Generation System Target Markets Target | Markets by Size
-----------------------------------------------+----------------
Truck Up-fitters & Service Centers | Asia 
Global Construction | North America 
Global Energy | Africa 
Utilities | Latin America 
Military | Middle East 

 
We believe our competition in the mobile generator market will be from well-established companies such as Cummins, Caterpillar, Doosan, Wacker Neuson, Multi Quip and Generac. All of them offer towable, trailer-mounted generators. Only Cummins Onan offers an onboard generator and it is specifically engineered for mobile emergency vehicle use. 
 
Portable generators also address a need for mobile electric power in the commercial, leisure and residential markets. As outputs tend to range from 1 to 20 kilowatts, the competition they provide is only at the lowest end of our power output spectrum and only from the higher power, higher quality and higher price commercial level units. Onan, Honda and Kohler are among the well-established brand names in the market. There are more than 40-manufacturing companies in the U.S that produce portable generators. 
 
A standard option that is usually ordered from the manufacturer when purchasing a truck is a power take-off or PTO. PTOs are mounted to a truck’s drivetrain and redirect engine power to operate onboard equipment. Integrated power systems use the PTO to run an alternating current generator. Cool Tech has the capability to power the generator directly from the drivetrain or from a PTO.
 
Real Power from Contour Hardening, Inc. offers one and three phase AC power systems driven by a PTO. According to their website, system voltages range from 10 to 200 kW. Systems under 100 kW retrofit under the beds of diesel trucks as small as Ford F-250s. Systems larger than 100 kW require Class 6 diesel trucks and a side mount. The retrofits integrate with the fuel system and generator speed is controlled automatically by the vehicle’s engine.
 
Modular integrated systems offer varying combinations of air compressors, welders, hydraulics and generators. Vanair Manufacturing, Inc’s Underdeck uses a PTO to power air compressors, hydraulics and either 6.6 or 9.6 kW generators, according to the company’s website. Their truck-mounted Air ‘n’ Arc All in One Power system adds welding and battery charger/booster capabilities and exports 4.2 to 7 kW from generators run by a second separate engine.
 
HIPPO Multipower packages hydraulic, air, electric and welding into a single unit. The company website showcases two models, one which connects to a truck’s PTO. The other is powered by a separate diesel engine. Power exported ranges from 5.2 to 9 kW. Units are traditionally mounted on the side or in the bed of a work truck.
 
The Miller Enpak from Miller Electric Manufacturing Company which is owned by Illinois Tool Works, Inc. offers the same package powered by a separate diesel engine that exports 6 kW of power, according to Miller’s website.

Many electric vehicles (“EV”) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEV”) can use excess battery capacity to provide exportable power with no idling. Most can be recharged from either the electrical grid or the vehicle’s engine. 
 
According to the VIA Motors Inc. website, the company is converting Chevrolet Silverado pick-up trucks and Express vans into hybrids with a panel to provide AC power through 115 and 240 volt electrical plugs. The optional power export module provides 14.4 kW at 60 amps. The company is also working on a utility-grade output module to deliver 50 kW. VIA Motors is producing crew-cab versions with prices in the $65,000 range, according to a January 2015 article in Bloomberg.com. Via Motors expects to have its technology available to customers within two years. 
 
Workhouse Group, Inc. has announced on their website plans to offer 7.2 Kilowatts of exportable power with an option for 14.4 kilowatts from their Plug-in Electric Pickup Truck. The company is taking pre-orders. According to a May 2017 article on MotorTrend.com, the Workhorse W-15 will go into production in late 2018 at a price of $52,500, and it will qualify for the $7,500 federal tax rebate and some state tax rebates. Workhorse hopes to build 10,000 trucks in its first year for fleet customers only.
 
Odyne Systems, LLC, is a manufacturer of hybrid systems for medium and heavy-duty work trucks over 14,000 pounds. According to their website, the systems are capable of exporting 6 to 18 kW of AC power.
 
Another way EV and PHEV can power onboard equipment is through an ePTO or electric power take-off which is essentially a battery-powered version of a PTO.
 
Terex’s Corporation’s hybrid-electric system, HyPower, targets the utility industry, specifically aerial lift, bucket truck and digger derrick applications. According to the company’s website, it features a plug-in ePTO that harnesses stored energy from rechargeable batteries to power onboard equipment and export up to 3.8 kW of power for up to six hours before needing to be recharged. 
 
Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. (“EDI”) develops and markets a range of PHEV and EV drivetrain systems. The drivetrain integrates with light, medium, or heavy duty vehicle designs. Their exportable power options provide 50 up to 160 kW of power for up to 12 hours. As noted in their website, the company recently introduced a Class 6 plug-in hybrid electric truck that exports as much as 160 kW of power. 
We believe that EDI is one of the few companies that offers an option to export synchronized power that enables the vehicle to connect directly to the utility power grid. According to an article posted December 11, 2017 on Forbes.com, the Electric Power Research Institute is leading a project to create a software system to standardize the interface between electric vehicles and electrical grids. It’s likely that the software would also have an application for vehicles that export power. 
 
According to their website, Electric Vehicles International, LLC, is developing a plug-in series hybrid truck that will have a 100 kW exportable power option.
 
Other companies use a vehicle's engine to charge on-board batteries, which then run the generator when the vehicle is stopped. While this eliminates idling, output tends to be less than 50 kilowatts (kW) and lithium-ion batteries typically power the system. The batteries have limited runtimes and a shorter lifespan than acid batteries. In addition, they must be cooled to operate properly. 
 
Altec Inc. JEMS (Jobsite Energy Management System) is an integrated plug-in system that uses stored electrical energy to power equipment and provide up to 18.3 kW of exportable power, according to the company’s website.
 
Two companies dominate belt driven systems: Aura Systems, Inc. and Mobile Electric Power Solutions, Inc. ("MEPS"). Both systems use a vehicle's engine to power a generator and produce electricity whenever the engine is running. The interface to the vehicle is under the hood via a separate belt system. Both are very efficient, capable of delivering the rated power at or near the engine's idle revolutions per minute ("RPM"). 
 


10

 
MEPS uses the alternator to power a belt-driven system that provides up to 15 kW. Both companies provide clean power to operate sophisticated electronic equipment. MEPS delivers alternating current ("AC") power, whereas Aura Systems outputs both AC and direct current ("DC").
 
A variety of MEPS engine or transmission-based electrical power take-off systems also provide exportable power. They tend to output small amounts in the range of 7 kW of 110/220 volt power. MEPS is able to align two generators to double the output to 15 kW. 
 
Our Mobile Generation system can also be used as a Level 2 charging unit for electric vehicles. ‘Levels’ indicate the charging power. The higher the level, the higher the power. More power equals shorter charging times. Level 2 is typically 240 volt AC current. It is compatible with most electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Depending on the battery technology, it takes about 4 to 6 hours to fully charge an electric vehicle. By utilizing the system’s telematics capability and its associated connection to the Internet, an MG retrofitted truck can be alerted by either the driver or the electric vehicle itself.
 
We currently intend to offer Level 3 charging which relies on 480 volt DC (direct current) power within a year. Most Level 3 chargers provide an 80% charge in 30 minutes. At that point, we believe that the system should become a viable and cost effective substitute for a standard charging station.
 
The only competition for mobile electric vehicle charging of which we are aware is Real Power, a division of Contour Hardening, Inc. Their self-contained system allows for Level 3 DC fast charging of compatible electric vehicles and uses a PTO driven generator. Their chassis-cab trucks provide up to 100 kW of power. The class 6 vehicles provide up to 200 kW.
 
Some of our potential competitors are significantly larger than we are, have been in business much longer than we have, and have significantly more resources at their disposal and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to changes in the marketplace, whether as a result of technological, economic or customer requirements or preferences. 
 
This also enhances their ability to obtain top engineering talent as well as sales representatives with strong industry ties. Plus, their greater market clout could effectively overwhelm our promotional and marketing efforts.
 
Equipment
 
As a company that intends to commercialize or license its proprietary technology for others to install, manufacture and/or distribute, our equipment needs are project specific and temporary. We do not intend to purchase any production equipment to implement our business operations, but instead we will rent, lease or outsource as needed.
Manufacturing
 
We do not plan to manufacture in-house. The Company plans to partner with manufacturers utilizing their assets and system integrators to up-fit our Mobile Generation technology. For our thermal technologies, the Company plans to rely on product development agreements with manufacturers who will then pay a license or royalty per unit. We anticipate that such agreements will delineate the respective intellectual property owned by both companies, describe the goal of the testing to verify the savings and value to a particular company, the equipment to be modified, the criteria that constitute successful testing, how and where the tests will be conducted and the next steps to be taken in the event of successful testing. 
Suppliers
 
For mobile power generation, the required software and its vehicle integration will be supplied by Czero, Inc. along with partner truck up-fitters. 
 
Production level quantities will be handled by KATO Engineering, a business unit of Nidec Corporation, with a backup of multiple other sources, if needed, such as Regal Beloit, Generac, etc. As for a supplier of our PPIG gearing system, we have identified and are working with both North American and Asian partners. We hope to obtain the balance of the components from a number of other suppliers.

11

 
Panasonic System Communications Company of North America will supply Panasonic Toughpad tablets, equipped with the CoolTech software to function as the Human Machine Interfaces. Field technicians to control and calibrate the Mobile Generation systems through the touchscreens. The Toughpads will be deployed in both the trucks’ cabs and in the control panel box on the side of the vehicles. 
 
For the thermal technology applications in electric motors, Thermacore, Inc. will supply the heat pipes and mechanical structure, which combine to make the heat exchangers. We will coordinate with Thermacore to combine our thermal technology with Thermacore technology in the creation of heat exchangers. 
 
For dry pit submersibles, we intend to purchase the wound stator and the rotor-shaft from Nidec Motor Corporation or other partner sources such as Baldor Electric, Regal Beloit and others. We intend to purchase the fully-machined castings from the Quality Castings Company, located in Orville, Ohio. We intend that these components will then be assembled and tested by Consulting Point, Inc. located in Brownsville, Texas or another partner assembler in the USA. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we have no licenses or contractual rights in place to protect our technology and intellectual property, only patents or patents pending. 
 
As of April 10, 2018, we have seven US patents, one Mexican patent, four pending patent applications (2 in Canada, 1 in Brazil, 1 US) and one filed US provisional application pending in the area of composite heat structures, motors and related structures, heat pipe architecture, applications (commonly referred to as "thermal" or "heat dispersion technology") and a parallel vehicle platform system. We also have Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications filed for a heat pipe cooled brake system, a parallel power input gearing system (“PPIG”) and radial vent thermal technology. In addition, we have applied for and received a trademark for an acronym for one of our technologies: "TEHPC"
 
Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may also rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. 
 
We strive to protect such proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. The Company has a policy of not disclosing its patent applications in order to protect the underlying technology. 
 
The following table sets forth the patents we own or license which we believe support our technology.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
We intend to conduct business worldwide and, therefore, we must comply with local, state, federal, and international regulations, both in operations and for our products. 
 
As a company, we do not plan to manufacture any of our products. Therefore, the government regulations we will be subject to will be limited to storage and involve rotating the shafts of stored electric motors on a regular basis.
 
Applicable laws and regulations include those governing, among other things, the handling, storage and transportation of materials and products as well as noise and employee safety. 
 
In addition, some of our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, emissions and fuel requirements. 
 
Accordingly, we may be required or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product or environmental safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications.
 
Although we believe that our operations and products are in material compliance with current applicable regulations noted within this section, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. New regulations could also require our licensees to redesign their products which could cause us to redesign our technologies which, consequently, could affect market growth for our products.
 
As our thermal technologies are incorporated in existing motors, generators and other manufactured products that are already subject to regulation. The regulatory burden will fall on the original equipment manufacturers that license our technology. 
 
The Company intends to add a mobile power generation system to Class 3-8 work trucks. In addition to an existing generator incorporating our thermal technology, the stand-alone version of our auxiliary mobile power system will include a specialized gearing package, which connects the drive train to a generator that will be added on-board. We believe that the vehicle and drive train will operate normally in accordance with manufacturer's specifications and that no regulations will be violated or exceeded as well. Nonetheless, in some markets, the Company will have to certify that it meets federal, state or local noise and emission regulations. 
 
Our designs comply with current EPA emission standards and we believe they will comply with future requirements. 
 
No original vehicle parts will be significantly modified in the retrofitting process. There will be some additional parts (generator, gearing system, touchscreens, software, sensors and controls) added, but these parts will not change how the vehicle operates in any way. Although we will be adding a gearing package to connect the drive train to the generator, the rest of the drive train will operate according to the manufacturer's specifications. Therefore, we believe that the original warranty will remain in effect and we do not believe that the conversion will violate the Magnuson-Moss Act.
 
The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law that protects consumers by barring a vehicle manufacturer from voiding the warranty on a vehicle due to an aftermarket part unless the manufacturer can prove that the aftermarket part caused or contributed to the failure in the vehicle. The Company will warranty the MG System with an industry standard warranty. All of our other components (generator, human machine interface, software, controller/sensors) will be warranted by their respective manufacturers.

The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") is charged with writing and enforcing safety and fuel economy standards for motor vehicles through their Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These standards require manufacturers to design their electrically powered vehicles so that, in the event of a crash, the electrical energy storage, conversion, and traction systems are either electrically isolated from the vehicle's chassis or their voltage is below specified levels considered safe from electric shock hazards. Our planned no-idle version of our Mobile Generation system will be designed to meet or exceed these requirements. 
 
In addition, the total weight of the additional components should remain within the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating. As a result, we believe that our retrofits will be in compliance with federal and state transportation regulations.
 
While we do not create and market our products around government subsidies and tax incentives, an MG truck equipped with a charger can provide a Level II charge to one or more electric vehicles. Our 200 kVA truck will enable Level III DC fast charging capability. Assuming the MG truck qualifies as a charging station.at least 26 states and a number of municipalities offer tax credits or rebates for electric vehicle charging stations.
 
If we fulfill all elements of our business plan, we will have to prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our products will have to comply with the current emission standards that went into effect in the European Union in 2015. as well as the standards in other international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China that are becoming more stringent. 
 
Employees
 
As of April 10, 2018, we had three full time employees and no part time employees. We hope to hire additional employees, on an as-needed basis, subject to sufficient funding, as products and services are developed. 
Research and Development
 
During the years 2017 and 2016, we incurred research and development costs of $348,424 and $251,724, respectively. Such costs were not borne directly by customers.
