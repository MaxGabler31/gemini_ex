Item 1.    Business
Overview
 
Historically, Walker Innovation Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Walker Innovation”), sought to develop and commercialize its unique portfolio of intellectual property assets through licensing and enforcement operations (“Licensing and Enforcement”). In response to challenging developments in the patent licensing and enforcement environment and the cessation of the Company’s custom innovation work the Company undertook an extended period of evaluation of potential acquisitions. On June 28, 2018, the Board of Directors of Walker Innovation concluded that none of the viable acquisition targets presented characteristics that fulfilled our criteria of increasing shareholder value and creating opportunity for investors and approved the liquidation and dissolution of the Company pursuant to a Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution (as amended to date, “Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution” or the “Plan”), subject to stockholder approval. The dissolution of the Company was approved by its stockholders at a special meeting held on September 5, 2018.
 
On September 7, 2018, the Company filed a certificate of dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which filing became effective on September 20, 2018 (the “Effective Date”). Subsequently, on September 27, 2018, the Company completed its initial liquidating distribution in the amount of $0.48 per share to each holder of its common stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, or $16,844,791 in the aggregate. The liquidating distribution was made to stockholders as of the Effective Date (including trades through the Effective Date that settled after the Effective Date). In connection with the initial liquidating distribution, the Company’s trading symbol on the OTCQB was deleted, the CUSIP for the common stock suspended and the Company’s transfer agent closed the transfer books as of the Effective Date (including trades through the Effective Date that settled after the Effective Date).
 
On September 28, 2018, the Company completed the sale of four vending patents for $55,000, which disposal followed the transfer to a third-party licensee of six gaming patents from the Company’s remaining portfolio in exchange for the third-party licensee’s assumption of certain Company obligations. As part of the dissolution process, the Company will continue to try to sell additional patents, although the net proceeds of any such disposals are not expected to materially alter future liquidating distributions, if any.
 
Subject to uncertainties inherent in the winding up of its business, Walker Innovation may make one or more additional liquidating distributions, as the Company’s required contingency reserves may be released over time. However, no assurances can be made as to the ultimate amounts to be distributed, if any, or the timing of any such distributions. Any additional liquidating distributions will be made to the stockholders as of the Effective Date of the certificate of dissolution (including trades through the Effective Date that settled after the Effective Date).
 
Prior to the Effective Date, Walker Digital, LLC (“Walker Digital”), was the owner of approximately 82% of the voting interest in the Company and approximately 48% of the economic interest (approximately 42% on a fully diluted basis), and voted for the Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution.
 
Prior to the Effective Date, the Company was led by entrepreneur and inventor Jay Walker, who is best known as the founder of Priceline.com.
 
Business
 
Prior to fiscal 2017, the Company operated in two primary segments of business, its Licensing and Enforcement business, and its custom innovation business. In the first quarter of 2016 the Company ceased operations of its custom innovation businesses.
Licensing and Enforcement
 
The Company sought to develop, license and otherwise enforce patented technologies through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company generated revenues from the granting of intellectual property rights for the use of, or pertaining to, its patented technologies. The Company also monetized its intellectual property through the sale and/or licensing of select patent assets.
 
All of our intellectual property assets were created with the goal of solving business problems, with the intent to achieve commercial status. However, it is our belief that certain of our inventions have become part of the commercial activities of other businesses without having been licensed, depriving us of financial value. The challenging patent environment, and declining revenues from the Licensing and Enforcement business was one factor that the Board considered when they approved the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. There are currently no pending litigation matters.

Intellectual Property/Patent Portfolio Overview
 
Our patent portfolio currently consists of approximately 59 U.S. issued patents. Our patents historically describe inventions in areas such as authentication techniques, internet search, social networking and advertising and online transactions, among many others. Historically, they were relevant to an array of large and growing industries including data management, e-commerce, electronic and computer hardware, social networking and internet services, financial services, entertainment and video gaming, online education, manufacturing, security and state lotteries. We received a valuation analysis of one of the patent families in the Company’s portfolio which estimates the residual value of such patents as below the continued required maintenance fees. Such patent family was subsequently transferred to a third-party licensee. The valuation analysis, taken together with the recent financial results of the Licensing and Enforcement business, is indicative of the likelihood that any additional distributions to stockholders resulting from the disposition of our remaining non-cash assets are highly unlikely and, if made, will be de minimis. We believe that based on these factors, the cost of maintaining the patents, including current maintenance costs, likely exceed their future cash value. 
Acquisition Efforts
 
Aided by capital proceeds received in connection with the exercise of a warrant to purchase Class A Common Shares of The Upside Commerce Group, LLC (“Upside”) at a price of $0.06 per share (the “Upside Warrant”), granted to the Company by Jay S. Walker, the controlling stockholder of the Company through his control of Walker Digital, and sale of the related Upside shares (described more fully below), in 2017 the Company initiated efforts to acquire, through merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, one or more operating businesses, either within its current verticals or in new industry segments, or control of such operating businesses through contractual arrangements. An investment bank was retained to advise the Company on its acquisition process and at the conclusion of the process the Board of Directors concluded that none of the viable acquisition targets presented characteristics that fulfilled our criteria of increasing shareholder value and creating opportunity for investors, and accordingly approved the liquidation and dissolution of the Company.
