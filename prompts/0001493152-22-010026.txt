Overview
 
Vision Hydrogen Corporation “Vision” was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 17, 2015 as H/Cell Energy Corporation and is based in Jersey City, New Jersey. On November 8, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with VoltH2 Holdings AG, a Swiss corporation, and shareholders of VoltH2 pursuant to which we acquired VoltH2 Holdings AG (“VoltH2”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired an 84.1% interest of VoltH2, and together with our existing 15.9% ownership interest, we now own 100% of VoltH2. VoltH2 is a European-based developer of clean hydrogen production facilities for the supply of commercial off-take volumes of clean hydrogen to manufacturers, gas and power traders, industrial consumers, and both heavy and marine transportation sectors that have pivoted away from carbon emitting energy sources and fuels.
 
The VoltH2 acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition with no step up basis due to the 15.9% ownership of VoltH2 by Vision prior to the acquisition and due to VoltH2 being an early stage company that has not generated revenues and lacks outputs. Since this transaction does not constitute the acquisition of a business, but a transfer of long lived there is no step up in basis. The SEC generally will not permit the recognition of gain in the transferor’s financial statements or a step-up in basis on the transferee’s books for sales or transfers of long-lived assets when related parties are involved. As a result of the Company’s previously held 15.9% interest in VoltH2, it was determined to be a related party. The acquisition consideration consisted of 8,409,0981 shares of Vision Hydrogen Corporation common stock granted on the acquisition date of November 8, 2021 at a closing market price of $11.  A deemed dividend for the excess share price over cost basis of the net assets of ($1,340,426) was recorded in the amount of $93,840,427.
 
Following our acquisition of VoltH2 , we plan to expand the inventory of prospective development sites for clean hydrogen production, replicating what has been initiated in Northwestern Europe . We aim to secure development sites at enviable locations that are proximate to existing gas and power infrastructure, within industrial clusters and with access to multi-modal logistics, including road, rail, water, barge, pipeline, for the distribution of hydrogen molecules to off-takers and  end users. The job development cycle of  each site typically ranges 12 months to 36 months, prior to construction, and is largely influenced by local planning, permits, regulations and economic feasibility including the cost of procuring low carbon electrons to supply the future electrolysers, and offtake contracts  for the hydrogen gas. In 2021, two locations have been secured and building and environmental permits have been acquired. Both projects are being developed with an estimated final investment decision scheduled for Q4-2022/Q1-2023. Until March 31, 2022, no offtake contract have been signed. The business development team is exploring the market and is negotiating with several off takers also known as end users of hydrogen.
 
Every project will be integrated into a separate special purpose vehicle (“SPV”)of which VoltH2 Vlissingen B.V., our subsidiary through the acquisition of VoltH2, is the first of two. Our second is Volt H2 Tereneuzen B.V. Our mission is to develop our project in Vlissingen  and Terneuzen, both located in The Netherlands while seeking to identify and secure other strategic locations to expand the concept. This includes the securing of land to develop new projects in different countries. Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands also have existing large pipeline networks that have been transporting hydrogen for decades. The Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg area (Benelux) has the largest hydrogen network in the world and consumption of hydrogen has reached almost 1.8 million tons of hydrogen per year.
 
We plan to generate revenue by divesting our projects in full, in part to energy industry participants and/or selling fractional ownership interests in sites under development. In addition, we plan to provide consulting services to other developers, industry participants, and governments focused on hydrogen production infrastructure projects. Lastly, as a long-term revenue opportunity, we plan to sell hydrogen production once plants are built and commissioned. We are currently in discussion with private landowners, such as energy companies, commodity traders, utilities, and industrial process customers. We may also purchase land if we believe it is practical and economically viable.

Recent Transactions
 
Acquisition of VoltH2 Holdings AG
 
On November 8, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with VoltH2 Holdings AG, a Swiss corporation, and the other shareholders of VoltH2 (each, a “Seller”, and together, the “Sellers”) pursuant to which we acquired VoltH2 (the “Acquisition”). VoltH2 is a European-based developer of clean hydrogen production facilities for the supply of commercial offtake volumes of clean hydrogen to manufacturers, gas and power traders, industrial consumers, and both heavy and marine transportation sectors that have pivoted away from carbon emitting energy sources and fuels.
 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired an 84.1% interest of VoltH2, and together with our existing 15.9% ownership interest, we now own 100% of VoltH2. The Acquisition was completed in exchange for 8,409,091 shares of our common stock (the “Consideration Shares”). In connection with the Acquisition, we also entered into an indemnification escrow agreement with one of the Sellers providing for the periodic release of up to 1,768,182 of the Consideration Shares and a pledge and security agreement to grant to us a continuing security interest in the Escrowed Shares to secure such Seller’s indemnity obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement. As mentioned earlier the acquisition consideration consisted of 8,409,0981 shares of Vision Hydrogen Corporation common stock granted on the acquisition date of November 8, 2021 at a closing market price of $11.  A deemed dividend for the excess share price over cost basis of the net assets of ($1,340,426) was recorded in the amount of $93,840,427.


Market Potential
 
As the world’s fossil fuel supply continually diminishes while causing harm to the planet, we believe that hydrogen is the most reliable alternative to carbon fossil fuels, as it leaves zero greenhouse gas residues and can be used at any time of the day or night, as well as in any weather conditions, unlike renewable energy from solar and wind.
 
Hydrogen is fast becoming a significant factor in the planning of future energy production and is anticipated by energy analysts to become more widely competitive as an alternative energy source by as early as 2030 as economies of scale drive-down the cost of fuel cells and electrolysers with the addition of lower costs for wind and solar power. According to the International Energy Agency report on hydrogen in north-western Europe the region is well placed to lead hydrogen adoption as a clean energy vector. Today, this region concentrates around 5% of global hydrogen demand and 60% of European demand. Moreover, the region is home to the largest industrial ports in Europe, where much of this hydrogen demand is located, and presents a well-developed natural gas infrastructure connecting these ports with other industrial hubs. This gas network could be partially repurposed to facilitate hydrogen delivery from production sites to demand centers. Governments in this region also have ambitious goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and strong political interest in hydrogen as an opportunity to maintain industrial activity in the region.

Technology Overview
 
There are great benefits to hydrogen energy such as being used as fuel for transportation and electricity. The use of hydrogen as a fuel produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Unlike fossil fuels, the sole emission from hydrogen fuel is chemically pure water. Hydrogen can be extracted from water using renewable energy from the sun and unlike batteries, hydrogen energy can be stored indefinitely. There is no drilling, fracking or mining required to produce hydrogen energy. We believe it is safe and efficient, and the cleanest energy source on the planet.
Competition
 
In Northwestern Europe, the market for green hydrogen or hydrogen produced by renewable energy is growing. Vision is the first adapter in the Benelux with two projects. Recently, RWE Renewables Co. has started the third project development in The Netherlands. Other energy companies are eager to start hydrogen production facilities. As an early adapter, Vision can and will have a guiding role in the development of green hydrogen. The current demand for hydrogen outnumbers the scheduled production for the next five to ten years. We believe that all competitors will face a high demand.
Government Regulations; Regulatory Matters
 
Our business activities require compliance with government and provisional regulations, including environmental regulations. Each plant must adhere to specific regulatory requirements of the permits. Without environmental permits and being compliant with international environmental and health safety and environmental standards, projects cannot reach the engineering, procurement and construction phase at final investment decision.
Government Incentives
 
We intend to focus on states on regions whose government supports a regulatory standard that promotes hydrogen production and consumption. These governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate and promote the use of hydrogen as renewable energy sources. These incentives may take the form of support for infrastructure and hydrogen transportation versus monetary incentives. The Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium have announced plans to support the development of green hydrogen initiatives. For example, in June 2020, as part of its economic COVID-19 stimulus package, Germany announced €9.0 billion of funding earmarked for expansion of hydrogen production. Funding is still to be determined, but specific areas could include, infrastructure conversions and new pipeline development. Pursuant to its “European Green Deal”, the EU has set the objective to become climate-neutral by 2050. This means that emissions of GHG must not exceed GHG removals and implies a phase-out of fossil fuels in the EU energy system. While renewable electricity can replace fossil fuels in many uses, it cannot easily replace them completely in road freight, shipping and aviation, or in industrial activities such as steel production, where fossil fuels are used as an energy source and as a reactant. However, hydrogen can play an important role in achieving climate neutrality in these areas. In The Netherlands, the government is developing a new subsidy scheme, called “Opschalingsinstrument Waterstof”, which is to be specially designed for developing green hydrogen facilities with a capacity from 5MW to 50MW. Details will be published in the summer of 2022 and application will be available in Q3/Q4 2022. With the current available information regarding this subsidy, Vision has the intention but cannot provide any assurances that we will apply for the Dutch projects. 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we had nine full-time employees. We plan to hire employees on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
