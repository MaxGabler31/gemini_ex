About Us 
Stagwell Inc. is the challenger network built to transform marketing. Stagwell delivers scaled creative performance for some of the world’s most ambitious brands, connecting creativity with leading-edge technology to harmonize the art and science of marketing. Led by entrepreneurs, we employ more than 10,000 people in 34+ countries across the globe who drive effectiveness and improve business results for our more than 4,000 blue-chip customers. In addition, our affiliate network adds coverage in 31 additional countries. 
Founded in 2015, Stagwell offers the capabilities marketers need in the digital age: Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, Consumer Insights & Strategy, and Creativity & Communications. Our global scale allows us to compete for many of the largest marketing contracts available, including multi-regional contracts with annual fees of more than $10 million. In addition, our proprietary Stagwell Marketing Cloud provides solutions for in-house marketers spanning influencer marketing, brand insights, communications technology and augmented reality. Stagwell provides a suite of marketing services that serve marketers’ needs as well as well tech-driven solutions for in-house marketers.
Stagwell has grown through a combination of organic growth and investment. Beginning with a single company in 2015, Stagwell focused on the fastest-growing area of marketing: digital services. Between 2015 and 2021, we acquired companies including digital transformation and digital media groups like Code and Theory and ForwardPMX. In 2019, Stagwell Media made a $100 million investment into MDC, the parent company of creative powerhouses including 72andSunny, Anomaly, Forsman & Bodenfors and Doner. Recognizing the potential of those companies, Stagwell’s reorganization and careful management of the portfolio turned the group around. In August 2021, Stagwell Media completed the Transactions with MDC to become Stagwell Inc.
The result is an innovative, digital-first challenger network built for the modern marketer. As the marketing landscape transforms – accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic – Stagwell is well placed to help brands transform their digital platforms, content, and data and targeting strategies with integrated services that deliver the right experience to the right person at the right time.
Stagwell’s unified corporate team is the foundation of a powerful value creation platform focused on scaling our portfolio of marketing services firms, which we refer to as Agencies, and driving continual network evolution. We plan to invest in our core digital platforms, develop a suite of digital products we call the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, expand our technology leadership through investment and innovation, and further develop and integrate our Global Affiliate Network to deliver value for our clients, employees, and shareholders.
Our Market
Industry Trends 
The digital revolution has changed where and how brands relate to consumers and created an entirely new, highly complex content and commerce ecosystem. Historically, marketing was characterized by television and brand advertising targeted to broad audiences: everyone saw the same advertisement at the same time. Over the last 15 years, digital innovation has created new, personalized ways to reach targeted consumers and spurred a fundamental shift in the marketing services landscape. Growth now comes primarily from digital marketing, helping brands meet customers across the entire digital ecosystem.
Four key trends describe the industry today:
First, online advertising now accounts for more than half of global advertising spend with the shift further accelerating as the COVID-19 pandemic continued and digital channels dominated content and commerce amidst evolving lockdowns. We expect the move of consumers online will be a lasting shift, and online now means virtually everywhere: websites, mobile, social media, television and even billboards and in-person experiences now deliver digital advertising.
Second, advertising is commerce. Digital platforms provide ways for brands to reach consumers directly through e-commerce. Platforms as diverse as TikTok and LinkedIn have created new ways for brands to interact with their customers. Brands can sell their products directly on their sites, via digital platforms such as Amazon or through interactive experiences enabled by social media like TikTok or connected TV. Digital platforms also allow advocacy groups and political campaigns to reach constituents to mobilize support or raise funds online.
Third, data is everywhere. Platform and channel growth has created an explosion of addressable data that can be used to better understand consumer desires, habits, and needs in real-time, allowing the delivery of content that consumers want, when they want it, and where they want it. New sources of online data include web, mobile, email, social, and connected TV and the data spans behavioral, transactional, demographic, psychographic and geographic categories.
Finally, marketing technology is transforming the industry. Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and data-as-a-service (“DaaS”) products are increasing the efficiency of marketing campaigns and in-house marketing operations, utilizing cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation and engaging consumers in new ways with emerging technologies such as augmented reality (“AR”) and virtual reality (“VR”).
Competitive Landscape 
Stagwell operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. Stagwell’s Agencies compete for business and talent with the operating subsidiaries of large global holding companies such as Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., WPP plc, Publicis Groupe SA, Dentsu Inc. and Havas SA, as well as with numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets. Our Agencies also face competition from consultancies, like Accenture and Deloitte, tech platforms, media companies and other services firms that offer related services. Stagwell’s Agencies must compete with these other companies to maintain and grow existing client relationships and to obtain new clients and assignments. Individual products within the Stagwell Marketing Cloud also typically compete with offerings that may be provided within broader service offerings at large global holding companies or provided on a standalone basis by technology startups or other industry participants.
During the decades when marketing was dominated by television, the marketing services industry experienced significant consolidation as legacy advertising holding companies built substantial portfolios of often overlapping creative, communications, PR, and media businesses to achieve financial efficiencies by centralizing administrative operations. These holding companies grew significant in size and market share.
The rapid rise of digital channels, convergence of advertising and commerce, explosion in addressable data and marketing technology created a paradigm shift in the industry. While legacy models still accounted for a significant share of the market in 2021, we believe they are largely underexposed to the digital areas of the market experiencing the highest levels of client demand growth. In recent years, a number of large consulting firms with information technology implementation backgrounds have entered the marketing services market and, collectively, achieved significant market share. However, we believe these 
firms’ lack of creative and media expertise limits their long-term growth potential as true challengers to the legacy marketing holding companies.
With a combination of talent and technology, we believe that Stagwell is well positioned to take advantage of the continued transformation sweeping the marketing universe, and to disrupt the marketing services landscape. Stagwell was born digital and now has a global network of entrepreneurial companies that deliver the right combination of creativity and technology for the modern, digital marketer through a model that emphasizes flexibility and integration. 
Our Offering 
Principal Capabilities
Stagwell’s Agencies provide differentiated, digital-first marketing and related services to a diverse client base across many industries.
Our principal capabilities fall into four categories: 1) Digital Transformation, 2) Performance Media & Data, 3) Consumer Insights & Strategy, and 4) Creativity & Communications. Taken together, these capabilities provide an integrated suite of marketing services for our blue-chip customer base.
Digital Transformation. We design and build digital platforms and experiences that support the delivery of content, commerce, services and sales. We create websites, mobile applications, back-end systems, content and data management systems, and other digital environments enabling clients to engage with consumers across the digital ecosystem. We design and implement technology and data strategies to support needed digital services for our clients. We also implement technology and strategies for utilizing digital channels to mobilize and raise funds from proponents and constituents to support political candidates, non-profit groups and issue organizations in the public arena. Lastly, we develop proprietary, in-house software and related technology products, including cookie-less data platforms for advanced audience targeting and activation, software tools for e-commerce applications and innovative applications of text messaging for consumer engagement, which we license to clients using subscription-based SaaS and DaaS models.
Performance Media & Data. We develop omnichannel media strategies and provide coordinated execution for the placement of advertisements across the media funnel including digital channels, performance marketing and analog placements globally. Unlike legacy holding companies that own large amounts of television inventory and therefore must sell it, we take a media-agnostic approach leveraging digital technologies and media in addition to analog advertising. Our services include media buying and planning, ranging across the platforms a modern marketer needs to engage consumers.
Consumer Insights & Strategy. We perform large-scale online surveys, specialized research, and data analytics across the consumer journey to provide strategic insights and guidance that informs business content, product, communications and media strategies for many of the world’s largest companies, including numerous Fortune 100 clients. We have differentiated specialization in brand tracking, theatrical and streaming content and strategy, and technology product design and marketing, and we believe our Agencies are at the forefront of innovation in the field.
Creativity & Communications. We develop holistic, creativity-based content strategies and campaigns from concept to execution through to optimization. These services include strategy development, advertising creation, live events, cross platform engagement, and social media content. We also provide strategic communications, public relations and public affairs services including media relations, thought leadership, social media, executive positioning and visibility.
We group our Agencies into these principal capability categories based on the source of most of their revenue. We also classify Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, and Consumer Insights & Strategy as “Digital” though Agencies categorized as Creativity & Communications generate a significant portion of revenue from creativity and content delivered on digital channels and some, such as Anomaly, do meaningful amounts of digital work that fluctuates as a percentage of revenue. We believe our concentration of digital capabilities today provides a competitive advantage in the marketplace and positions us to benefit from continued digital disruption in the marketing services industry. We plan to continue to invest in our core digital platforms as well as emerging technologies to effectively support marketing transformation for our clients.
Network Structure & Reportable Segments
Stagwell maintains a 100% ownership position in substantially all of its Agencies, and the remainder are majority owned with management of the Agencies owning the remaining equity. Stagwell generally has rights to increase ownership of non-wholly owned subsidiaries to 100% over a defined period of time. 
The Company organizes its Agencies into three reportable segments: “Integrated Agencies Network,” “Media Network” and the “Communications Network.” In addition, the Company combines and discloses operating segments that do not meet the aggregation criteria as “All Other.” The Company also reports corporate expenses, as further detailed below, as “Corporate.”
The reportable segments are:
•The Integrated Agencies Network includes four integrated operating segments: the Anomaly Alliance, Constellation, the Code and Theory Network, and the Doner Partner Network. These operating networks are organized for go-to-market and collaboration incentive purposes and to facilitate integrated and flexible offerings for our clients. Each integrated network consists of agencies that offer an array of complementary services spanning our core capabilities of Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, Consumer Insights & Strategy, and Creativity & Communications. The Agencies included in the operating segments that comprise the Integrated Agencies Network reportable segment are as follows: Anomaly Alliance (Anomaly, Concentric, Hunter, Mono, YML and Scout agencies), the Code and Theory Network (Code and Theory, Forsman & Bodenfors, National Research Group, Observatory, Hello Design and Colle McVoy agencies), Constellation (72andSunny, Crispin Porter Bogusky, Instrument, Team Enterprises, Harris and Redscout agencies) and the Doner Partner Network (Doner, KWT Global, Bruce Mau Design, Vitro, Harris X, Northstar, Veritas and Yamamoto agencies).
These integrated network operating segments share similar characteristics related to (i) the nature of their services; (ii) the type of clients and the methods used to provide services; and (iii) the extent to which they may be impacted by global economic and geopolitical risks. In addition, these operating segments may occasionally compete with each other for new business or have business move between them.
•The Media Network reportable segment is comprised of a single operating segment, our specialist network branded the Stagwell Media Network (“SMN”). SMN serves as a unified media and data management structure with omni-channel media placement, creative media consulting, influencer and business-to-business marketing capabilities. Our Agencies in this segment aim to provide scaled creative performance through developing and executing sophisticated omnichannel campaign strategies leveraging significant amounts of consumer data. SMN’s Agencies combine media buying and planning across a range of digital and traditional platforms (out-of-home, paid search, social media, lead generation, programmatic, television, broadcast, among others) and includes multichannel agencies Assembly, Goodstuff, MMI Agency, and Grason, digital creative & transformation consultancy GALE, B2B specialist Multiview, multi-lingual content agency Locaria, CX specialists Kenna, and travel media experts Ink.
•The Communications Network reportable segment is comprised of a single operating segment, our specialist network that provides advocacy, strategic corporate communications, investor relations, public relations, online fundraising and other services to both corporations and political and advocacy organizations and consists of our Allison & Partners SKDK (including Sloane & Company), and Targeted Victory Agencies.
•All Other consists of the Company’s digital innovation group, Reputation Defender (which was sold in September 2021) and Stagwell Marketing Cloud products such as PRophet.
•Corporate consists of corporate office expenses incurred in connection with the strategic resources provided to the operating segments, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to the operating segments. These office and general expenses include (i) salaries and related expenses for corporate office employees, including employees dedicated to supporting the operating segments, (ii) occupancy expenses relating to properties occupied by all corporate office employees, (iii) other office and general expenses including professional fees for the financial statement audits and other public company costs, and (iv) certain other professional fees managed by the corporate office. Additional expenses managed by the corporate office that are directly related to the operating segments are allocated to the appropriate reportable segment and the All Other category.
Go-To-Market Strategy
Our global go-to-market strategy is key to our objective of providing our clients with a balanced combination of leading-edge technology and creative talent. We go to market in three main ways: as individual Agencies, as networks where collaboration across services is needed and as Stagwell Global when we create multi-region, Stagwell-wide teams.
Unlike legacy holding companies who have focused on achieving cost synergies by consolidating agencies within their networks, Stagwell focuses on collaboration. We believe it is important for our Agencies to maintain their individual identities to attract the highest quality talent within their capabilities of expertise. Maintaining strong Agency identities within our integrated Agencies and specialist networks provides a structure supporting both individual and joint go-to-market approaches. Maintaining separate Agencies with flexibility to integrate also enables effective management of potential conflicts of interest. Go-to-market collaboration typically occurs on larger engagements requiring services across multiple capabilities or geographies.
To further support collaboration, Stagwell provides financial incentives for Agencies to collaborate with one another through referrals and the sharing of both services and expertise. Network and Agency leaders have components of incentive compensation that are based on Stagwell’s overall performance and the overall performance of their integrated or specialist networks to incentivize go-to-market collaboration.
In addition to our owned Agencies, we maintain a network of go-to-market alliances with like-minded independent Agencies, tech companies and marketing services firms in key markets around the world. These partners, which we refer to as Global Affiliates, enable us to increase our local-market reach and qualify for business opportunities that require enhanced capabilities in specific local markets without taking on additional costs. Launched in early 2021, by December 2021 the Global Affiliate Network had achieved its goal of growing to include more than 50 affiliates.
Our distinct Agency structure enables us to work with multiple clients within the same business sector, and many of our largest clients are served by multiple Agencies or Agencies in our portfolio. The Agencies’ work is supported by a centralized marketing and new business team that fosters collaboration, sources new business opportunities and communicates across industries to drive awareness of our offerings. Additionally, a centralized corporate innovation team develops and invests in proprietary digital marketing products that are distributed by Agencies across the network, further enhancing the value proposition Stagwell Agencies are able to offer clients.
Our Strategy
The key components of the Stagwell strategy are Digital, Integrated, Global, and Strategic (“DIGS”). We believe the DIGS model gives us a sustainable, long-term path to significant growth and supports our primary objectives which are sustaining strong levels of organic growth, increasing our digital revenue mix, increasing international scale, expanding the average client relationship size, and maintaining strong margins and free cash flow. We believe pursuing these objectives will position us to increase value for our shareholders.
Our strategy is focused around six specific initiatives: 1) Investing in Digital Capabilities, 2) Expanding Addressable Markets, 3) Effective Integration at Scale, 4) Strategic Value Creation Platform, 5) Maintaining a Highly Variable Cost Structure, and 6) Efficient Capital Allocation.
Investing in Digital Capabilities
Our digital businesses serve the areas where we expect the fastest growth in the marketing space and position us to lead the wave of transformation in the industry. By investing in our core digital platforms and introducing proprietary SaaS and DaaS marketing technology (“martech”) products, we aim to increase the digital proportion of our net revenue. We aim to expand our digital capabilities in three main ways:
•First, we intend to continue to invest in our leading digital Agencies like Code and Theory, Instrument and YML. This planned investment includes funding new capabilities and supporting cross-selling via our integrated Agencies network, which has already seen success in 2021.
•Second, we intend to pursue complementary acquisition opportunities to bolster our existing assets in areas such as digital transformation and digital media buying. We have built a successful track record of “bolt-on” acquisitions such 
as TrueLogic Software, LLC, Ramenu S.A. and Polar Bear Development S.R.L. (together, “TrueLogic”), a Latin America engineering shop, and Kettle Solutions, LLC (“Kettle”), a content and digital design firm.
•Third, we are investing in the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, a suite of technology products in development or early-stage commercialization spanning influencer marketing, audience segmentation, public relations, immersive experiences and brand insights. These products are licensed to our clients using subscription-based SaaS and DaaS models and distributed by Agencies across our network. We believe the Stagwell Marketing Cloud positions us to serve in-house marketing departments and create recurring, high-value revenue streams in the future.
Expanding Addressable Markets
We are focused on expanding our addressable markets through investments that increase our global footprint as well as adding emerging marketing technologies in areas expected to have strong secular growth. We believe increasing our geographic presence and breadth of capabilities will allow us to significantly grow our average client relationship size over time.
•International Markets: Our strategy for growing our international operations is focused on expanding our media buying, content creation and digital capabilities in new markets, which will improve our qualifications for large multi-regional contracts with the largest global marketers. For example, in December 2021 we acquired Goodstuff, a leading independent media buying agency in the United Kingdom, substantially improving the breadth of our media buying capabilities in that market and throughout Europe. We also maintain a network of Global Affiliates that helps us embed local talent into global and local engagements without committing investment capital—enabling us to think globally and act locally simultaneously and deliver creative, performance, media and technology capabilities at the scale required to serve the world’s largest marketers. We believe our Global Affiliates will be a valuable source for acquisitions, providing us the ability to explore strategic fit with our networks prior to making a formal investment. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 50 Global Affiliate partners in our network.
•Emerging Marketing Technologies: In addition to the advertising and marketing services market, we believe our investments in the Stagwell Marketing Cloud will position us to address new, rapidly expanding market opportunities, including marketing data, campaign martech, the metaverse, and AR and VR applications. For example, in January 2021 we launched ARound, which creates augmented reality experiences for live events.
Effective Integration at Scale
We expect to drive significant long-term operating efficiencies from the Transactions through initiatives being rolled out over the 36 months following the completion of the Transactions. We expect synergies will come from implementation of shared services across the Company, elimination of redundancies in the Stagwell Media Network, scaling operational resources in lower cost markets, and third-party spend recapture, among other cost-saving initiatives.
 Within our client-facing integrated and specialist networks we see further opportunity to achieve operating efficiencies by increasing our non-U.S. based engineering footprint. We are focused on scaling our development capabilities in lower cost markets, specifically Latin America, India, and Southeast Asia. Our engineering talent is primarily focused on building and designing digital platforms, applications, tools, and experiences for our clients and are typically more highly concentrated in our Agencies categorized within our Digital Transformation primary capability. We believe we already have a substantial engineering presence globally – more than 1,150 engineers total – and have developed the necessary skills to support hiring, training and managing large teams outside the United States. We believe these markets offer a significant supply of quality technical talent to meet increasing client demand for high-speed delivery of digital transformation and production services.
Stagwell Value Creation Platform
We believe our engaged, unified corporate team provides a growth platform for value creation through both revenue and cost synergies for our existing Agencies and prospective investments. We are led by a management team with deep industry expertise and a track record of growing and managing marketing services businesses. The Stagwell platform provides a foundation to support efficient, accretive scaling of our global network and our high-growth digital transformation and digital media capabilities. Our corporate objective is to accelerate the growth and improve the profitability of our Agencies, and we believe agencies see strategic value in being part of the Stagwell network.
Our value creation platform has three layers: Client Services, Growth Investment and Shared Services.
Our Client Services layer aims to facilitate revenue growth through go-to-market support. Our Global Solutions team provides a single point of contact for key clients, coordinating our go-to-market strategies for large, multi-regional contracts or business opportunities requiring cross-agency, cross-capability or cross-market services. Our Global Growth team provides prospecting and new business services to our agencies, working in partnership with our Brand team which supports messaging and communications efforts. At the network level, the Stagwell Media Network provides a corporate structure to cost-effectively coordinate our global media placement capabilities, while our Global Affiliate Network positions our agencies to pitch for and win opportunities requiring capabilities in specific local markets.
Our Growth Investment layer is designed to drive continual network evolution and bolsters competitive advantages in key markets, capabilities, and emerging technologies and consists of two teams: centralized investment and innovation. Our central investment team, which has a strong track record of accretive investments, provides expertise in sourcing, negotiating and structuring investments in close partnership with our Agency leadership, to drive efficient scaling of our networks and accelerate growth. In addition to our investment team, a centralized innovation team provides development capabilities for The Stagwell Marketing Cloud and bespoke client needs.
Our Shared Services layer provides unified back-office systems via Stagwell CORE (“CORE”), the Company’s newly formed platform that focuses on transitioning away from disparate teams, processes and systems and establishing a standardized platform. CORE provides centralized services across back office operational functions, including information technology (“IT”), accounts payable and receivable, real estate, enterprise-level contract administration, and accounting services. With a focus on driving shareholder value by optimizing cost structures and facilitating efficient integration of acquired businesses, CORE’s services are highly standardized with an emphasis on scalability to support Stagwell’s growth.
Maintaining a Highly Variable Cost Structure 
We are focused on maintaining a business model that has attractive cash flow, revenue growth and margin expansion and plan to maintain a highly variable cost structure that allows us to be nimble. We aim to focus our investments on people-based businesses that operate with a high percentage of variable costs. Our at-will employment structure positions us to respond rapidly to changing market conditions in order to maintain margins. We also strive to diligently deploy low capital investment strategies. For example, we believe our Global Affiliate Network strategy for expanding international capabilities positions us to maintain a high level of flexibility through macroeconomic cycles. 
Our management team has successfully demonstrated an ability to efficiently operate, manage and grow a profitable portfolio of diverse advertising businesses through periods of dramatic changes in consumer behavior, technological advancement and economic cycles. The team has a successful track record of investing, acquisition execution and integration as well as recruiting and retaining the key talent that drives our operating businesses.
Efficient Capital Allocation
We are focused on delivering continued strong organic growth and free cash flow to support efficient capital allocation that generates value for our shareholders. Our primary use of capital is expected to be funding diligently structured, highly accretive investment in businesses we believe will support sustainable future growth by increasing the breadth and depth of our capabilities. We also expect more modest capital allocation towards minimizing shareholder dilution, reducing leverage in order to provide increased financial flexibility, and funding development of proprietary technology and products for the Stagwell Marketing Cloud. 
Our Clients
Stagwell serves a large base of clients across the full spectrum of industry verticals. In many cases, we serve the same clients in various geographic locations, across multiple disciplines, and through multiple Agencies. Representation of a client rarely means that Stagwell handles marketing communications for all brands or product lines of the client in every geographical location. During 2021 and 2020 the Company did not have a client that accounted for 7% or more of revenues. In addition, Stagwell’s ten largest clients (measured by revenue generated) accounted for approximately 17% and 35% of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Historically, client concentration increases during election years due to the cyclical nature of our advocacy Agencies which are Targeted Victory and SKDK (including Sloane & Company).
Stagwell’s agencies have written contracts with many of their clients. As is customary in the industry, these contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Overview” for a further discussion of Stagwell’s arrangements with its clients.
Sources of Revenue 
Stagwell provides a broad range of services to a large base of clients across a wide spectrum of verticals globally. Stagwell has historically largely focused in North America where the Company was founded, as well as the United Kingdom, but has expanded its global footprint to support clients globally and has a presence in 34+ countries, and an additional 31 countries through our Global Affiliate Network. The primary source of revenue is from agency arrangements in the form of fees for services performed, commissions, and from performance incentives or bonuses. Stagwell’s Agencies have written contracts with many of their clients. As is customary in the industry, these contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Overview” for a further discussion of Stagwell’s arrangements with its clients.
Seasonality
Historically, we have typically generated the highest quarterly revenue during the fourth quarter in each year due to consumer marketing increases from the back-to-school and holiday seasons. In addition, we have typically seen an increase in revenue in the third and fourth quarters during even years because our advocacy business has higher revenue during the biannual U.S. election cycle. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,100 full-time employees and approximately 1,100 contractors. The following table provides a breakdown of full-time employees and contractors across Stagwell’s three reportable segments, the All Other category, and Corporate:

Segment | Total 
Integrated Agencies Network | 6,250 
Media Network | 2,800 
Communications Network | 950 
All Other | 50 
Corporate | 150 
Total | 10,200

Because of the personal service nature of the marketing and communications business, our talent is of critical importance to our success. Human capital management strategies are developed by senior management, including the management teams of our Agencies, and are overseen at the corporate level.
Our human capital management priorities include providing competitive benefits & compensation, attracting and retaining talent, supporting learning & development across the network, promoting Diversity & Inclusion, increasing employee engagement, and ensuring workplace safety with specific initiatives around COVID-19. At the corporate level, centralized human capital management processes include development of human resources governance and policy, executive compensation for senior leaders, benefits programs, and succession planning focusing on the performance, development and retention of key senior executives.
Benefits & Compensation
Stagwell provides a full range of competitive benefits including medical, dental, vision, employer-funded HSAs, commuter assistance, 401k and more, offered to full-time employees and their dependents, inclusive of domestic and/or same-sex partners. We offer flexible paid time off as well as accommodations for civic duties, bereavement, and leaves of absence. Stagwell participates in industry-wide salary surveys and utilizes AI-powered compensation software to obtain real-time compensation survey data and analytics and ensure all compensation decisions are data-driven. In addition, we have various stock ownership programs for eligible Stagwell employees.
Attracting & Retaining Talent
Hiring and retaining transformative talent is key to Stagwell’s mission. We supplement agency-led recruiting with central recruiting support. Leveraging our scale, we have developed a broad database of global talent that further enhances our recruiting activities. In addition to utilizing central resources and technology, agency-level recruiting activities include partnerships with colleges/universities, internship programs, referral programs and diversity, equity and inclusion specific pipelining programs. Stagwell’s internal transfer policy also enables employees to explore new positions with other Agencies at the Company to support retention of talent within the broader network.
Learning & Development
At the corporate level, Stagwell invests in both our senior leadership and up-and-coming leaders through a professional development partnership with a globally recognized leadership development organization. The program is designed to align individual growth with organizational strategy to help achieve success across both. Furthermore, Stagwell provides eligible employees with an annual, flexible professional development budget to utilize if they want to explore more opportunities within their field, acquire new skills, and enhance their contributions to their department and the organization. In addition, each Agency maintains its own policies and development programs suitable to its workforce and leadership goals.
Diversity & Inclusion
We believe the cultures of Stagwell’s individual Agencies are what sets working at Stagwell apart; however, the connective tissue that unites us is our vision for our Agencies and people to work collaboratively across disciplines in an inclusive environment. 
Stagwell supports its Agencies through access to high-quality education, resources and technology, which they can use to bring inclusion to life based on their organization’s needs. In addition to providing annual harassment prevention and ethics training globally, we actively collect data modeled after equal employment opportunity classifications with the goal of ensuring our employee demographics better reflect the diversity of the communities in which our workforce operates and is hired from and to identify areas for improvement through corporate engagement and initiatives. In addition, Stagwell aims to continue to grow successful partnerships with diverse vendors, suppliers, contractors, and consultants. 
We believe doubling down on creating an inclusive environment, from building internal and external partnerships, fostering the collaboration amongst our agencies, to trying out ideas and programs from our teams and agencies, will attract and retain a diverse workforce and that the diversity of thought creates impact for our clients globally. 
Employee Engagement
Regular communication is a commitment at Stagwell. We have quarterly global Town Halls to ensure staff are engaged with and organizational goals are shared. And, although in-person events have been limited by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Workplace Experience team hosts a variety of wellness programs at our New York City “HUB” locations at the World Trade Center and, as practicable, in other offices around the world. Our global CEO sends out regular emails to all staff with key updates ranging from new business wins to client work. In addition, the Hive intranet serves as a resource portal for all Stagwell employees.
Significant Factors Affecting our Business and Results of Operations
The most significant factors affecting our business and results of operations include national, regional, and local economic conditions, our clients’ profitability, mergers and acquisitions of our clients, changes in top management of our clients and our ability to retain and attract key employees. New business wins and client losses occur due to a variety of factors. We believe the two most significant factors are (i) our clients’ desire to change marketing communication firms and (ii) the digital and data-driven products that our Agencies offer. A client may choose to change marketing communication firms for several reasons, such as a change in leadership where new management wants to retain an agency that it may have previously worked with. In addition, if the client is merged or acquired by another company, the marketing communication firm is often changed. Clients also change firms as a result of the firm’s failure to meet marketing performance targets or other expectations in client service delivery.
Regulatory Environment
The marketing and communications services that our agencies provide are subject to laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include laws and regulations that affect the form and content of marketing and communications activities that we produce for our clients and, for our digital services, laws and regulations concerning user privacy, use of personal information, data protection and online tracking technologies. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can receive, transfer or process data that we use in our operations, including data shared between countries in which we operate. Our international operations are also subject to broad anti-corruption laws. While these laws and regulations could impact our operations, we believe compliance in the normal course of the Company’s business has not significantly impacted the services we provide or had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial position. Additional information regarding the impact of laws and regulations on our business is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

STAGWELL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)
1. Business and Basis of Presentation 
Stagwell Inc. (the “Company” or “Stagwell”), incorporated under the laws of Delaware, conducts its business through its networks and their Brands (“Brands”), which provide marketing and business solutions that realize the potential of combining data and creativity. Stagwell’s strategy is to build, grow and acquire market-leading businesses that deliver the modern suite of services that marketers need to thrive in a rapidly evolving business environment. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stagwell and its subsidiaries. Stagwell has prepared the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for reporting financial information on this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates about current and future results of operations and cash flows that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.
On December 21, 2020, MDC Partners Inc. (“MDC”) and Stagwell Media LP (“Stagwell Media”) announced that they had entered into the Transaction Agreement, providing for the combination of MDC with the operating businesses and subsidiaries of Stagwell Media (the “Stagwell Subject Entities”). The Stagwell Subject Entities comprised Stagwell Marketing Group LLC (“Stagwell Marketing”) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
On August 2, 2021, we completed the previously announced combination of MDC Partners Inc. (“MDC”) and the operating businesses and subsidiaries of Stagwell Media LP. (“Stagwell Media”) and a series of related transactions (such combination and transactions, the “Transactions”). The Transactions were treated as a reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, with MDC treated as the legal acquirer and Stagwell Marketing Group LLC (“Stagwell Marketing or SMG”) treated as the accounting acquirer. The results of MDC are included within the Audited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period beginning on the date of the acquisition through the end of the respective period presented and the results of SMG are included for the entire period presented. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (the “Notes” included herein for information in connection with the acquisition of MDC.
The Company continues to monitor the worldwide public health threat and government actions to combat COVID-19 and the impact such developments may have on the overall economy, our clients and operations. The impact of the pandemic and the corresponding actions are reflected in our judgments, assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the financial statements. The judgments, assumptions and estimates will be updated and could result in different results in the future depending on the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normally recurring accruals, which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation, in all material respects, of the information contained therein. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation. 
Recent Developments
On March 11, 2022, the Company and Mark Penn, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, entered into (i) a Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the “Second A&R Employment Agreement”) and (ii) an Amended and Restated Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement (the “A&R SARs Agreement”). The Second A&R Employment Agreement and the A&R SARs Agreement provide that, with respect to the December 14, 2021 award to Mr. Penn of 1,500,000 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) in respect of the Company’s Class A common stock with a base price equal to $8.27 under the Company’s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), (i) the SARs will be settled only in cash upon any exercise, and (ii) the SARs will be considered to have been granted outside of the Plan and are not subject to stockholder approval.
 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized as follows:
Principles of Consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stagwell Inc. and its domestic and international controlled subsidiaries that are not considered variable interest entities, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and 
Table of Contents

liabilities including goodwill, intangible assets, contingent deferred acquisition consideration, redeemable noncontrolling interests, deferred tax assets, right-of-use lease assets and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported during the period. These estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates require the use of assumptions about future performance, which are uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual results differ from the assumptions used, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
Fair Value. The Company applies the fair value measurement guidance for financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value and for non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including goodwill, right-of-use lease assets and other identifiable intangible assets. See Note 18 of the Notes included herein for additional information regarding fair value measurements.
Concentration of Credit Risk. The Company provides marketing communications services to clients who operate in most industry sectors. Credit is granted to qualified clients in the ordinary course of business. Due to the diversified nature of the Company’s client base, the Company does not believe that it is exposed to a concentration of credit risk. No sales to an individual client accounted for more than 7% of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company’s cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in overnight interest-bearing deposits, money market instruments and other short-term investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company has a concentration of credit risk in that there are cash deposits in excess of federally insured amounts and international cash balances that may not qualify for foreign government insurance programs. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Trade receivables are stated at invoiced amounts less allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults usually due to customers’ potential insolvency. The allowances include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions. Allowance for doubtful accounts was $5,638 and $5,109 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Expenditures Billable to Clients. Expenditures billable to clients consist principally of outside vendor costs incurred on behalf of clients when providing services that have not yet been invoiced to clients. Such amounts are invoiced to clients at various times over the course of the period.
Fixed Assets. Fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Computers, furniture and fixtures, and capitalized software are depreciated on a straight-line basis over periods of three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Accumulated depreciation was $44,652 and $28,364 at December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively.
Leases. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification, Leases (“ASC 842”). The Company recognizes on the balance sheet at the time of lease commencement a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. All right-of-use lease assets are reviewed for impairment. With the adoption of ASC 842, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients: (i) whether a contract is or contains a lease, (ii) the classification of existing leases, and (iii) whether previously capitalized costs continue to qualify as initial indirect costs. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for all operating leases. See Note 10 of the Notes included herein for further information on leases.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets. A long-lived asset or asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of such asset or asset group. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows where observable fair values are not readily determinable. The discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on the Company’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), risk adjusted where appropriate, or other appropriate discount rate.
Goodwill. Goodwill (the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired) acquired as a result of a business combination which is not subject to amortization is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually as of October 1st of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.
For the annual impairment test, the Company has the option of assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value or performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in the assessment include industry and market considerations, the competitive 
Table of Contents

environment, overall financial performance, changing cost factors such as labor costs, and other factors specific to each reporting unit such as change in management or key personnel.
If the Company elects to perform the qualitative assessment and concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired and the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. For reporting units for which the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and for reporting units for which the qualitative assessment is not performed, the Company will perform the quantitative impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company uses a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. The Company generally applies an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for the impairment test. The income approach and the market approach both require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, assumed terminal value and appropriate discount rates.
The DCF estimates incorporate expected cash flows that represent a spectrum of the amount and timing of possible cash flows of each reporting unit from a market participant perspective. The expected cash flows are developed from the Company’s long-range planning process using projections of operating results and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates, demand trends and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit’s WACC as determined by considering the observable WACC of comparable companies and factors specific to the reporting unit. The terminal value is estimated using a constant growth method which requires an assumption about the expected long-term growth rate. The estimates are based on historical data and experience, industry projections, economic conditions, and the Company’s expectations.
Definite Lived Intangible Assets. Definite lived intangible assets are subject to amortization over their useful lives. A straight-line amortization method is used over the estimated useful life which is representative of the pattern of how the economic benefits of the specific intangible asset is consumed. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company uses an income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method.
Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly, the assets acquired (including identified intangible assets), the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. 
For each acquisition, the Company undertakes a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets. The Company uses several market participant measurements to determine the estimated value. This approach includes consideration of similar and recent transactions, as well as utilizing discounted expected cash flow methodologies. A substantial portion of the intangible assets value that the Company acquires is the specialized know-how of the workforce, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not required to be valued separately. The majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names and trademarks.
Deferred Acquisition Consideration. Certain acquisitions include an initial payment at the time of closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments. Contingent purchase price obligations for these transactions are recorded as deferred acquisition consideration liabilities on the balance sheet, at the acquisition date fair value and are remeasured at each reporting period. These liabilities are derived from the projected performance of the acquired entity. These arrangements may be dependent on future events, such as the growth rate of the earnings of the relevant subsidiary during the contractual period. At each reporting date, the Company models each business’ future performance, including revenue growth and free cash flows, to estimate the value of each deferred acquisition consideration liability. The liability is adjusted quarterly based on changes in current information affecting each subsidiary’s current operating results and the impact this information will have on future results included in the calculation of the estimated liability. These adjustments are recorded in the results of operations. In instances where such contingent payments require the sellers’ continuous employment with the Company after the transaction, they are recorded as compensation expense in the Audited Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Many of the Company’s acquisitions include contractual arrangements where the noncontrolling shareholders have an option to purchase, or may require the Company to purchase, such noncontrolling shareholders’ incremental ownership interests under certain circumstances. The Company has similar call options under the same contractual terms. The amount of consideration under these contractual arrangements is not a fixed amount, but rather is dependent upon various valuation formulas, such as the average earnings of the relevant subsidiary through the date of exercise 
Table of Contents

or the growth rate of the earnings of the relevant subsidiary during that period. In the event that an incremental purchase may be required by the Company, the amounts are recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interests in mezzanine equity on the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets at their acquisition date fair value and adjusted for changes to their estimated redemption value through Retained earnings or Paid-in capital (when at an accumulated deficit) in the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets (but not less than their initial redemption value), except for foreign currency translation adjustments. These adjustments will not impact the calculation of earnings (loss) per share if the redemption values are less than the estimated fair values.
Control to Control Subsidiary Purchases. Transactions involving the purchase, sale or issuance of interests of a subsidiary where control is maintained are recorded as a reduction in the redeemable noncontrolling interests or noncontrolling interests, as applicable. Any difference between the purchase price and noncontrolling interest is recorded to Paid-in capital in the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets. In circumstances where the purchase of shares of an equity investment results in obtaining control, the existing carrying value of the investment is remeasured to the acquisition date fair value and any gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.
Revenue Recognition. The Company’s revenue is recognized when control of the promised services are transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 5 of the Notes included herein for additional information.
Cost of Services. Cost of services sold primarily consists of staff costs that are directly attributable to the Company’s client engagements, as well as third-party direct costs of production and delivery of services to its clients. Cost of services sold does not include depreciation, amortization, and other office and general expenses that are not directly attributable to the Company’s client engagements.
Deferred Financing Costs. The Company uses the effective interest method to amortize deferred financing costs and any original issue premium or discount, if applicable. The Company also uses the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, to amortize the deferred financing costs.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records associated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Management evaluates on a quarterly basis all available positive and negative evidence considering factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, taxable income in eligible carryback years, projected future taxable income, the character of the income tax asset, tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws and other factors. The periodic assessment of the net carrying value of the Company’s deferred tax assets under the applicable accounting rules requires significant management judgment. A change to any of these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.
Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the service period, generally the award’s vesting period. The Company uses its historical volatility derived over the expected term of the award to determine the volatility factor used in determining the fair value of the award. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. 
Stock-based awards that are settled in cash or equity at the option of the Company are recorded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value measurement of the compensation cost for these awards is based on using the Black-Scholes option pricing-model or other acceptable method and is recorded in Operating income (loss) over the service period, in this case the award’s vesting period.
The Company has adopted the straight-line attribution method for determining the compensation cost to be recorded during each accounting period. The Company commences recording compensation expense related to awards that are based on performance conditions under the straight-line attribution method when it is probable that such performance conditions will be met. 
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries grant awards to their employees providing them with an equity interest in the respective subsidiary (“profits interests awards”). The profits interests awards are substantive equity, settled in cash and accounted for under ASC 718, Share Based Payments. The profits interests awards represent a liability that is remeasured at fair value at each reporting period.
Retirement Costs. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries offer employees access to certain defined contribution retirement programs. Under the defined contribution plans, these subsidiaries, in some cases, make annual contributions to participants’ accounts which are subject to vesting. The Company’s contribution expense pursuant to these plans was $9,797 and $3,949 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also has a defined benefit pension plan. See Note 12 of the Notes included herein for additional information on the defined benefit plan.

Income (Loss) per Common Share. Basic income (loss) per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted income (loss) per common share is based on the above, in addition, if dilutive, common share equivalents, which include outstanding options, stock appreciation rights, and unvested restricted stock units. In periods of net loss, all potentially issuable common shares are excluded from diluted net loss per common share because they are anti-dilutive.
Foreign Currency Translation. The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Generally, the Company’s subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. Accordingly, the currency impacts of the translation of the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company and its non-U.S. dollar based subsidiaries to U.S. dollar statements are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation of intercompany debt, which is not intended to be repaid, is included in cumulative translation adjustments. Cumulative translation adjustments are not included in Net income (loss) unless they are actually realized through a sale or upon complete, or substantially complete, liquidation of the Company’s net investment in the foreign operation. Translation of current intercompany balances are included in Net income (loss). The balance sheets of non-U.S. dollar based subsidiaries are translated at the period end rate. The Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Company and its non-U.S. dollar based subsidiaries are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Gains and losses arising from the Company’s foreign currency transactions are reflected in Foreign exchange, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 3. New Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability and other items. ASU 2021-08 is effective January 1, 2023; however, the Company has early adopted the standard and retrospectively applied it to the financial statements herein. 
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, and in January subsequently issued ASU 2021-01, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance, through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.
4. Acquisitions and Dispositions
2021 Acquisitions
Acquisition of MDC Partners Inc.
On December 21, 2020, MDC Partners Inc. (“MDC”) and Stagwell Media LP (“Stagwell Media”) announced that they had entered into the a transaction agreement, providing for the combination of MDC with the operating businesses and subsidiaries of Stagwell Media (the “Stagwell Subject Entities”) (the “Transaction Agreement”). The Stagwell Subject Entities comprised Stagwell Marketing Group LLC (“Stagwell Marketing or SMG”) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
On August 2, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we completed the combination of MDC and the Stagwell Subject Entities and a series of steps and related transactions (such combination and transactions, the “Transactions”). In connection with the Transactions, among other things, (i) MDC completed a series of transactions pursuant to which it emerged as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, converted into a Delaware limited liability company and changed its name to Midas OpCo Holdings LLC (“OpCo”); (ii) Stagwell Media contributed the equity interests of Stagwell Marketing and its direct and indirect subsidiaries to OpCo; and (iii) the Company converted into a Delaware corporation, succeeded MDC as the publicly-traded company and changed its name to Stagwell Inc. 
In respect of the Transactions, the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, together with acquired processes and employees, represent a business as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The Transactions were accounted for as a reverse acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, pursuant to ASC 805-10, Business Combinations, with MDC treated as the legal acquirer and SMG treated as the accounting acquirer. In identifying SMG as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, MDC and SMG took into account a number of factors, including the relative voting rights and the corporate governance structure of the Company. SMG is considered the accounting acquirer since Stagwell Media controls the board of directors of the Company following the Transactions and received an indirect ownership interest in the Company’s only operating subsidiary, OpCo, of 69.55% ownership of OpCo’s common units. However, no single factor was the sole determinant in the overall conclusion that Stagwell is the acquirer for accounting purposes; rather all factors were considered in arriving at such conclusion. Under the 
Table of Contents

acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of MDC, as the accounting acquiree, were recorded at their respective fair value as of the date the Transactions were completed.
On August 2, 2021, an aggregate of 179,970,051 shares of the Company’s Class C Common Stock were issued to Stagwell Media in exchange for $1.8 (the “Stagwell New MDC Contribution”). The Class C Common Stock does not participate in the earnings of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate of 179,970,051 OpCo common units were issued to Stagwell Media in exchange for the equity interests of the Stagwell Subject Entities (the “Stagwell OpCo Contribution”).
The fair value of the purchase consideration is $425,752, consisting of approximately 80,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A and B Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents based on a per share price of approximately $5.42, the closing stock price on the date of the combination.
ASC 805 requires the allocation of the purchase price consideration to the fair value of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon consummation of a business combination. For this purpose, fair value shall be determined in accordance with the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”). Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” Fair value measurements can be highly subjective and can involve a high degree of estimation. 
The total purchase price to acquire MDC has been allocated to the assets acquired and assumed liabilities based upon preliminary estimated fair values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the date of acquisition are based on preliminary estimates assisted, in part, by a third-party valuation expert. The estimates are subject to change upon the finalization of appraisals and other valuation analyses, which are expected to be completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Although the completion of the valuation activities may result in asset and liability fair values that are different from the preliminary estimates included herein, it is not expected that those differences would alter the understanding of the impact of this transaction on the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Company.
The preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows:

 | Amount 
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 130,153
Accounts receivable | 413,839 | 
Other current assets | 41,736 | 
Fixed Assets | 80,047 |

Net liabilities assumed | (873,622) | 
Goodwill | 1,299,374 | 
Purchase price consideration | $ | 425,752

Table of Contents

The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of MDC. Goodwill of $1,058,411, $174,719 and $66,244 was assigned to the Integrated Agencies Network, the Media Network and the Communications Network reportable segments, respectively. The majority of the goodwill is non-deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill has been updated from the previously reported amount of $1,270,081 to reflect a change in certain assets and liabilities, primarily the remeasurement of leases. There has been no change that impacts the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Intangible assets consist of trade names and customer relationships. We amortize purchased intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. The weighted average life of the total acquired identifiable intangible assets is thirteen years. The following table presents the details of identifiable intangible assets acquired. 

 | Estimated Fair Value | | Estimated Useful Life in Years
Trade Names | $ | 98,000 | | | 10
Customer Relationships | 712,900 | | | 6-20
Total Acquired Intangible Assets | $ | 810,900 | | | 

MDC operating results are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2021 with revenue of $605,448 and a nominal net loss.
Transaction expenses were approximately $15,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.

Acquisition of Goodstuff Holdings Limited
On December 31, 2021, the Company acquired GoodStuff Holdings Limited (“Goodstuff”) for approximately £21,000 (approximately $28,053) of cash consideration as well as contingent consideration up to a maximum of £22,000. The cash consideration included an initial payment of £8,000, an excess working capital payment of approximately £9,000 and approximately £4,000 of deferred payments. The contingent consideration is tied to employees’ service and therefore will be recognized as compensation expense through 2026. Therefore, only the cash consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and assumed liabilities of Goodstuff based upon preliminary estimated fair values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows:

 5. Revenue 
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are established in accordance with ASC 606, and accordingly, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Stagwell network provides an extensive range of services to our clients, offering a variety of marketing and communication capabilities including strategy, creative and production for advertising campaigns across a variety of platforms (print, digital, social media, television broadcast), public relations services including strategy, editorial, crisis support or issues management, media training, influencer engagement and events management. We also provide media buying and planning across a range of platforms (out-of-home, paid search, social media, lead generation, programmatic, television broadcast), experiential marketing and application/website design and development. 
The primary source of the Company’s revenue is from agency arrangements in the form of fees for services performed, commissions, and from performance incentives or bonuses, depending on the terms of the client contract. In all circumstances, revenue is only recognized when collection is reasonably assured. Certain of the Company’s contractual arrangements have more than one performance obligation. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices charged to clients or using expected cost plus margin.
The determination of our performance obligations is specific to the services included within each contract. Based on a client’s requirements within the contract, and how these services are provided, multiple services could represent separate performance obligations or be combined and considered one performance obligation. Contracts that contain services that are not significantly integrated or interdependent, and that do not significantly modify or customize each other, are considered separate performance obligations. Typically, we consider media planning, media buying, creative (or strategy), production and experiential marketing services to be separate performance obligations if included in the same contract as each of these services can be provided on a stand-alone basis, and do not significantly modify or customize each other. Public relations services and application/website design and development are typically each considered one performance obligation as there is a significant integration of these services into a combined output. 
Certain of the Company’s contracts consist of a single performance obligation. In these instances, the Company does not consider the underlying activities as separate or distinct performance obligations because its services are highly interrelated, and the integration of the various components is essential to the overall promise to the Company’s customer. In certain of the Company’s client contracts, the performance obligation is a stand-ready obligation because the Company provides a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract.
We typically satisfy our performance obligations over time, as services are performed. Fees for services are typically recognized using input methods (direct labor hours, materials and third-party costs) that correspond with efforts incurred to date in relation to total estimated efforts to complete the contract. To a lesser extent, revenue is recognized using output measures, such as impressions or ongoing reporting. For client contracts when the Company has a stand-ready obligation to perform services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract, where the scope of these arrangements includes an undefined number of broad activities and there are no significant gaps in performing the services, the Company recognizes revenue ratably using a time-based measure. In addition, for client contracts where the Company is providing online subscription-based hosted services, it recognizes revenue ratably over the contract term. Point in time recognition primarily relates to certain commission-based contracts, which are recognized upon the placement of advertisements in various media when the Company has no further performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized net of sales and other taxes due to be collected and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company’s contracts typically provide for termination by either party within 30 to 90 days. Although payment terms vary by client, they are typically within 30 to 60 days. In addition, the Company generally has the right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date.
Within each contract, we identify whether the Company is principal or agent at the performance obligation level. In arrangements where the Company has substantive control over the service before transferring it to the client, and is primarily responsible for integrating the services into the final deliverables, we act as principal. In these arrangements, revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed. Accordingly, for these contracts the Company has included reimbursed expenses in revenue. In other arrangements where a third-party supplier, rather than the Company, is primarily responsible for the integration of services into the final deliverables, and thus the Company is solely arranging for the third-party supplier to 
Table of Contents

provide these services to our client, we generally act as agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained, when the fee or commission is earned. The role of Stagwell’s agencies under a production services agreement is to facilitate a client’s purchasing of production capabilities from a third-party production company in accordance with the client’s strategy and guidelines. The obligation of Stagwell’s agencies under media buying services is to negotiate and purchase advertising media from a third-party media vendor on behalf of a client to execute its media plan. We do not obtain control prior to transferring these services to our clients; therefore, we primarily act as agent for production and media buying services.                                    
A small portion of the Company’s contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions, which allow the Company to earn additional revenues as a result of its performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals. Incentive compensation is primarily estimated using the most likely amount method and is included in revenue up to the amount that is not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of cumulative revenue recognized. We recognize revenue related to performance incentives as we satisfy the performance obligation to which the performance incentives are related.
Disaggregated Revenue Data
The Company provides a broad range of services to a large base of clients across the full spectrum of verticals globally. The primary source of revenue is from agency arrangements in the form of fees for services performed, commissions, and from performance incentives or bonuses. Certain clients may engage with the Company in various geographic locations, across multiple disciplines, and through multiple Brands. Representation of a client rarely means that Stagwell handles marketing communications for all Brands or product lines of the client in every geographical location. The Company’s Brands often cooperate with one another through referrals and the sharing of both services and expertise, which enables Stagwell to service clients’ varied marketing needs by crafting custom integrated solutions. Additionally, the Company maintains separate, independent operating companies to enable it to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest by representing competing clients across the Stagwell network.
The following table presents revenue disaggregated by our principal capabilities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:

 | | Twelve Months Ended December 31,
Principal Capabilities | Reportable Segment | | 2021 | | 2020 | | 
Digital Transformation | All Segments | | $ | 400,857 | | | $ | 374,689

Stagwell has historically largely focused where the Company was founded in North America, the largest market for its services in the world. The Company has expanded its global footprint to support clients looking for help to grow their businesses in new markets. Stagwell’s Brands are located in the United States and United Kingdom, and more than thirty other countries around the world. In the past, some clients have responded to weakening economic conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets, which included discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses.

Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contract assets consist of fees and reimbursable outside vendor costs incurred on behalf of clients when providing advertising, marketing and corporate communications services that have not yet been invoiced to clients. Unbilled service fees were $116,558 and $30,570 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included as a component of Accounts receivable on the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outside vendor costs incurred on behalf of clients which have yet to be invoiced were $63,065 and $11,063 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Expenditures billable to clients. Such amounts are invoiced to clients at various times over the course of providing services. Additions to contract assets of $99,853 were added during the period as a result of the acquisition of MDC.
Contract liabilities consist of fees received from or billed to clients in excess of fees recognized. Such fees are classified as Advance billings presented on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In arrangements in which we are acting as an agent, the recognition related to the contract liability is presented on a net basis within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Advance billings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $361,885 and $66,418, respectively. The increase in the Advance billings balance of $295,467 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the acquisition of MDC, representing a 211,403 increase, and by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, partially offset by $64,446 recognized that were included in the Advance billings balances as of December 31, 2020 and reductions due to the incurrence of third-party costs. 
Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were not materially impacted by write offs, impairment losses or any other factors.
The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less. For those contracts with a term of more than one year, we had approximately $22,812 of unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2021, of which we expect to recognize approximately 93% in 2022 and 7% in 2023.
6. Income (Loss) Per Common Share

On September 23, 2021, the Company provided notices of conversion to each holder of record of each of the Company’s Series 6 and Series 8 Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the notices, the 50,000,000 issued and outstanding Series 6 Preferred Shares were converted into 12,086,700 Class A Common Shares, in the aggregate, on October 7, 2021, and the 73,849,000 issued and outstanding Series 8 Preferred Shares were converted into 20,948,746 Class A Common Shares, in the aggregate, on November 8, 2021. 
The combination of MDC and SMG was completed on August 2, 2021, which was treated as a reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes. SMG was treated as the accounting acquirer and MDC was the accounting acquiree. Therefore, under applicable accounting principles, the historical financial results of SMG prior to August 2, 2021 are considered our historical financial results. Accordingly, historical information presented in this Form 10-K for events occurring or periods ending before August 2, 2021 does not reflect the impact of the Transactions or the financial results of MDC and may not be comparable with historical information for events occurring or periods ending on or after August 2, 2021.
Table of Contents

SMG’s equity structure, prior to the combination with MDC, was a non-unitized single member limited liability company, resulting in all components of equity attributable to the member being reported within Members' Capital. Given that SMG was a non-unitized single member limited liability company, net income (loss) prior to the combination is not applicable for purposes of calculating earnings per share. Therefore, the net income (loss) in the table above includes the income or loss for the period beginning on the acquisition date through the end of the respective reporting period and as such will not reconcile to the respective amounts presented within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

9. Deferred Acquisition Consideration
Deferred acquisition consideration on the balance sheet consists of deferred obligations related to contingent and fixed purchase price payments, and to a lesser extent, contingent and fixed retention payments tied to continued employment of specific personnel. Contingent deferred acquisition consideration is recorded at the acquisition date fair value and adjusted at each reporting period through operating income. The Company accounts for certain retention payments through operating income as compensation expense over the required retention period.
Table of Contents

 The following table presents changes in contingent deferred acquisition consideration, which is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, and a reconciliation to the amounts reported on the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

 | December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020

Approximately $136,000 of additions represent deferred acquisition consideration acquired in connection with the purchases of noncontrolling interests. See Note 4 of the Notes included herein for additional information related to the purchases of Concentric, Targeted Victory, and Instrument.
10. Leases
The Company leases office space in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. This space is primarily used for office and administrative purposes by the Company’s employees in performing professional services. These leases are classified as operating leases and expire between years 2022 through 2034. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial.
The Company’s leasing policies are established in accordance with ASC 842, and accordingly, the Company recognizes on the balance sheet at the time of lease commencement a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. Right-of-use lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. All right-of-use lease assets are reviewed for impairment. As the Company’s implicit rate in its leases is not readily determinable, in determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of noncancelable lease payments, payments based upon an index or rate, payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early.
Lease costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Some of the Company’s leases contain variable lease payments, including payments based upon an index or rate. Variable lease payments based upon an index or rate are initially measured using the index or rate in effect at the lease commencement date and are included within the lease liabilities. Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the index or rate, rather changes in these types of payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. In addition, some of our leases contain variable payments for utilities, insurance, real estate tax, repairs and maintenance, and other variable operating expenses. Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in the period when the facts and circumstances which the variable lease payments are based upon occur.
Some of the Company’s leases include options to extend or renew the leases through 2044. The renewal and extension options are not included in the lease term as the Company is not reasonably certain that it will exercise its option.
From time to time, the Company enters into sublease arrangements with unrelated third parties. These leases are classified as operating leases and expire between years 2022 through 2027. Sublease income is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Currently, the Company subleases office space in North America, Asia, Europe and Australia. 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has entered into eleven operating leases for which the commencement date has not yet occurred, primarily because the premises are in the process of being prepared for occupancy by the landlord or the space is being renewed. Accordingly, these eleven leases represent an obligation of the Company that is not reflected within the Audited

Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. The aggregate future liability related to these leases is approximately $19,069.
The discount rate used for leases accounted for under ASC 842 is the Company’s collateralized credit adjusted borrowing rate.

Revolving Credit Agreement
On November 18, 2019, the Company entered into a debt agreement (“JPM Syndicated Facility”) with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A (“JPM”). The JPM Syndicated Facility consisted of a five-year revolving credit facility of $265,000 (“JPM Revolver”) with the right to be increased by an additional $150,000. On March 18, 2020, the Company increased the commitments on the JPM Revolver by $60,000 to $325,000. 
On August 2, 2021, in connection with the closing of the acquisition of MDC, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Combined Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks led by JPM to increase commitments on the existing JPM Revolver. The Combined Credit Agreement consists of a $500,000 senior secured revolving credit facility with a five-year maturity. 
The Combined Credit Agreement contains sub-limits for revolving loans and letters of credit of $50,000 for loans denominated in pounds sterling or euros. It also includes an accordion feature under which the Company may request, subject to lender approval and certain conditions, to increase the amount of the commitments to an aggregate amount not to exceed $650,000. 
Borrowings under the Combined Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) the greatest of (a) the prime rate of interest announced from time to time by JPM, (b) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.50% and (c) the LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus the applicable margin (calculated based on the Company’s total leverage ratio) at that time or (ii) the LIBOR rate plus the applicable margin (calculated based on the Company’s total leverage ratio) at that time. The Company is also required to pay an unused revolver fee to the lenders under the Combined Credit Agreement in respect of the unused commitments thereunder ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% of unused commitments depending on the total leverage ratio, as well as customary letter of credit fees.
Advances under the Combined Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part from time to time without penalty or premium. The Combined Credit Agreement commitment may be reduced by the Company from time to time. Principal amounts outstanding under the Combined Credit Agreement are due and payable in full at maturity within five years of the date of the Combined Credit Agreement.
If an event of default occurs under the Combined Credit Agreement or any future secured indebtedness, the holders of such secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our assets securing such indebtedness, to the exclusion of the holders of the 5.625% Notes (as defined below), even if we are in default with respect to the 5.625% Notes. In that event, our assets securing such indebtedness would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under the Combined Credit Agreement), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the 5.625% Notes and other unsecured indebtedness.
The Combined Credit Agreement contains a number of financial and nonfinancial covenants and is guaranteed by substantially all of our present and future subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. 
The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2021.
Table of Contents

A portion of the Combined Credit Agreement in an amount not to exceed $50,000 is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had issued undrawn outstanding letters of credit of $24,332 and $5,500, respectively.
Term Loan
On November 13, 2020, the Company, JPM as administrative agent, and a group of lenders entered into a term loan agreement that provided the Company with a delayed draw term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $90,000 (“DD Term Loan A”) with a maturity date of November 13, 2023. 
In connection with the acquisition of MDC, the Company drew down on the full amount of the DD Term Loan A, repaid the amount with the Combined Credit Agreement, and terminated the agreement. 
Line of Credit
On August 2, 2021, the Company entered into an unsecured uncommitted line of credit in the aggregate amount of $30,000 with JPM (the “Line of Credit”) to meet certain short-term working capital needs. The Line of Credit expired on August 20, 2021. 
Senior Notes
In August 2021, the Company issued $1,100,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes (“5.625% Notes”). A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.625% Notes was used to redeem $870,300 aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 7.50% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Notes”) for a price of $904,200. This price is equal to 101.625% of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Notes being redeemed, plus, accrued, and unpaid interest on the principal amount of such Existing Notes. The Company did not recognize a gain or loss on redemption. 
The 5.625% Notes are due August 15, 2029 and bear interest of 5.625% to be paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2022.
The 5.625% Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 5.625% Notes rank (i) equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s or any guarantor’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness, (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s or any guarantor’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness, (iii) effectively subordinated to any of the Company’s or any guarantor’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness, including the Combined Credit Agreement, and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries that are not guarantors.
Our obligations under the 5.625% Notes are unsecured and are effectively junior to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Borrowings under the Combined Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, and any existing and future subsidiary guarantors, including all of the capital stock of each restricted subsidiary.
The Company may, at its option, redeem the 5.625% Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, on and after August 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 102.813% of the principal amount thereof if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on August 15, 2024, at a redemption price of 101.406% of the principal amount thereof if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on August 15, 2025 and at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof if redeemed on August 15, 2026 and thereafter. Prior to August 15, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 5.625% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.625% Notes plus a “make whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may also redeem, at its option, prior to August 15, 2024, up to 40% of the 5.625% Notes with the net proceeds from one or more equity offerings at a redemption price of 105.625% of the principal amount thereof.
If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control (as defined in the indenture), holders of the 5.625% Notes may require the Company to repurchase any 5.625% Notes held by them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 5.625% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if the Company sells assets under certain circumstances, it must offer to repurchase the 5.625% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.625% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The indenture includes covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase the capital stock of the Company; make certain types of investments; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts from the Company’s restricted subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of the Company’s assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The 5.625% Notes are also subject to customary events of default, including cross-payment default and cross-acceleration provisions. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2021.

12. Employee Benefit Plan
A subsidiary of the Company, sponsors a defined benefit plan with benefits based on each employee’s years of service and compensation. The benefits under the defined benefit pension plan are frozen. 
Net Periodic Pension Cost and Pension Benefit Obligation 
Net periodic pension cost consists of the following components for the years ended December 31:

 | Pension Benefits | 
 | 2021 | 
Interest cost on benefit obligation | 441 | 
Expected return on plan assets | (697) | 
Net periodic benefit cost | $ | (256)

The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine net periodic costs at December 31:

 | Pension Benefits
 | 2021 
Discount rate | 2.62 | %
Expected return on plan assets | 6.50 | %

The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes.
Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligation recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following components for the year ended December 31:

 | Pension Benefits |

Amount recognized | $ | 722

In 2022, the Company estimates that it will not recognize any amortization of net actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net into net periodic cost related to the pension plan.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31:

 | Pension Benefits
 | 2021 | 
Discount rate | 2.82 | %

The discount rate assumptions at December 31, 2021 was determined independently. The discount rate was derived from the effective interest rate of a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality bonds, whose cash flows match the expected future benefit payments from the plan as of the measurement date.

Fair Value of Plan Assets and Investment Strategy
The fair value of the plan assets as of December 31, is as follows:

 | December 31, 2021 | | Level 1 | | Level 2 | | Level 3

Money market fund – Short-term investments | $ | 937 | | | $ | 937 | | $ | — | $ | —
Mutual funds | 25,418 | | | 25,418 | | | — | | —
Total | $ | 26,355 | | | $ | 26,355 | | $ | — | $ | —

The pension plans weighted-average asset allocation for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:

 | Target Allocation | | Actual Allocation
 | 2021 | | 2021 
Asset Category: | | | 
Equity securities | 65.0 | % | | 69.1 | %
Debt securities | 30.0 | % | | 27.3 | %
Cash/cash equivalents and Short-term investments | 5.0 | % | | 3.6 | %
 | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %

The goals of the pension plan investment program are to fully fund the obligation to pay retirement benefits in accordance with the plan documents and to provide returns that, along with appropriate funding from the Company, maintain an asset/liability ratio that is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and assures timely payment of retirement benefits.
Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies located in the United States. Debt securities are diversified across different asset types with bonds issued in the United States as well as outside the United States. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the preceding tables.
Cash Flows
The pension plan contributions are deposited into a trust, and the pension plan benefit payments are made from trust assets. During 2021, the Company did not make any contributions to the pension plan. The Company does not expect that it will make any contributions to the pension plan in 2022. Fluctuations in actual market returns as well as changes in general interest rates will result in changes in the market value of plan assets and may result in increased or decreased retirement benefit costs and contributions in future periods.
The following estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the years ending December 31:

Period | Amount
2022 | $ | 1,698
2023 | 1,933 | 
2024 | 2,167 | 
2025 | 2,111 | 
2026 | 2,087 | 
Thereafter | 10,721 | 

13. Noncontrolling and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling Interests
When acquiring less than 100% ownership of an entity, the Company may enter into agreements that give the Company an option to purchase, or require the Company to purchase, the incremental ownership interests under certain circumstances. Where the option to purchase the incremental ownership is within the Company’s control, the amounts are recorded as noncontrolling interests in the equity section of the Company’s Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Where the incremental

purchase may be required of the Company, the amounts are recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interests in mezzanine equity at their estimated acquisition date redemption value and adjusted at each reporting period for changes to their estimated redemption value through Retained earnings (but not less than their initial redemption value), except for foreign currency translation adjustments. 
Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in our less than 100% owned subsidiaries during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

 | Twelve Months Ended December 31,

Approximately $27,000 represents redeemable noncontrolling interests acquired in connection with the purchase of the noncontrolling interest of Targeted Victory. See Note 4 of the Notes included herein for additional information related to the purchase of Targeted Victory.
The noncontrolling shareholders’ ability to exercise any such option right is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including conditions requiring notice in advance of exercise and specific employment termination conditions. In addition, these rights cannot be exercised prior to specified staggered exercise dates. The exercise of these rights at their earliest contractual date would result in obligations of the Company to fund the related amounts during 2021 to 2025. It is not determinable, at this time, if or when the owners of these rights will exercise all or a portion of these rights.
The redeemable noncontrolling interest of $43,364 as of December 31, 2021, consists of $41,324, assuming that the subsidiaries perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels, $2,040 upon termination of such owner’s employment with the applicable subsidiary or death, and $0 representing the initial redemption value (required floor) recorded for certain acquisitions in excess of the amount the Company would have to pay should the Company acquire the remaining ownership interests for such subsidiaries.
These adjustments will not impact the calculation of earnings (loss) per share if the redemption values are less than the estimated fair values. There is no related impact on the Company’s income per share calculations.
14. Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees
 Legal Proceedings. The Company’s operating entities are involved in legal proceedings of various types. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty, the Company has no reason to believe that the outcome of such proceedings or claims will have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company cash flows. 
Deferred Acquisition Consideration and Options to Purchase. See Notes 9 and 13 of the Notes included herein for information regarding potential payments associated with deferred acquisition consideration and the acquisition of noncontrolling shareholders’ ownership interest in subsidiaries.
Guarantees. Generally, the Company has indemnified the purchasers of certain assets in the event that a third party asserts a claim against the purchaser that relates to a liability retained by the Company. These types of indemnification guarantees typically extend for a number of years. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees. The Company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to guarantees and indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred and would recognize any such losses under any guarantees or indemnifications in the period when those losses are probable and estimable.
Commitments. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $24,332 of undrawn letters of credit. See Note 11 of the Notes included herein for additional information.
The Company entered into operating leases for which the commencement date has not yet occurred as of December 31, 2021. See Note 10 of the Notes included herein for additional information.

Balance at December 31, 2021 | 1,048,000 | | $ | 8.68 | | 15,699,102 | | $ | 5.49

 The vesting of the performance-based awards is contingent upon the Company meeting cumulative earnings targets over three years and continued employment through the vesting date. The term of the time-based awards is generally three years with vesting up to generally three years. The vesting period of the time-based and performance-based awards is generally commensurate with the requisite service period.
The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, which vested during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was $1,527. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining contractual life for time-based and performance-based awards was 0.37 and 2.37 years, respectively.
At December 31, 2021, the unrecognized compensation expense for performance-based awards was $8,221 to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.37 years. At December 31, 2021, the unrecognized compensation expense for time-based awards was $15,376 to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.37 years. 
The following table summarizes information about stock appreciation rights (“SAR”) awards:

 | SAR Awards

Balance at December 31, 2021 | 4,892,779 | | $ | 2.79 | | $ | 4.58

 We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of the SAR awards. The grant date fair values of the options granted in 2021 ranged from $2.20 to $3.66. The assumptions for the model were as follows: expected life ranging from 2.8 to 4 years, risk free interest rate of approximately 1.0%, expected volatility ranging from of 35.5% to 38.1%, and dividend yield of 0.0%. Options granted in 2021 vest in 1 to 3 years. The term of these awards is 5 years. The vesting period of these awards is generally commensurate with the requisite service period. 
As of December 31, 2021, 1,950,000 SAR awards vested and were exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the SAR awards outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was $19,677. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining contractual life for the SAR awards was 1.15 years.
At December 31, 2021, the unrecognized compensation expense for these awards was $4,639 to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.15 years.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, $75,032 was recognized in stock compensation related to all stock compensation awards. The related income tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $5,289.

Subsidiary Awards 
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries grant awards to their employees providing them with an equity interest in the respective subsidiary (the “profits interests awards”). The awards generally provide the employee the right, but not the obligation, to sell its profits interest in the subsidiary to the Company based on a performance-based formula and, in certain cases, pay a profit share distribution. The profits interests awards are settled in cash and the corresponding liability at fair value was $36,418 at December 31, 2021 (Level 3 fair value model), and included as a component of Accruals and other liabilities and Other liabilities on the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $23,398 (associated with a pre-tax income of $59,558) compared to an income tax expense of $5,937 (associated with pre-tax income of $77,340) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. 
Prior to merger on August 2, 2021, the Company was a limited liability company classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such was not subject to taxes from a U.S. federal income tax perspective. After the merger on August 2, 2021, the Company is a corporation with an investment in a limited liability company classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such a portion of the consolidated income is not subject to taxes from a U.S. federal income tax perspective. The tax rate of 21% has been used to capture the U.S. federal taxes of the Company and the corporations owned by the Company and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
The significant drivers of the effective tax rate for 2021 relate to the segmentation of the income between the portion subject to entity level tax and the portion of income reported directly by the non-controlling interests, state income taxes, and non-deductible stock based compensation. 
The significant drivers of the effective tax rate for 2020 relate to the segmentation of income between the portion subject to entity level tax and the portion of income reported directly by the Member, state income taxes, as well as valuation allowances established during the period.
Income taxes receivable were $790 and $0 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were included in other current assets on the balance sheet. Income taxes payable were $24,643 and $4,244 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were included in accrued and other liabilities on the balance sheet. It is the Company’s policy to classify interest and penalties arising in connection with unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Stagwell Inc. itself has net operating loss carryforwards of $133,859 which expire years 2031 through 2041. These definite lived net operating loss carryforwards consist of $17,862 relating to U.S federal, and $115,997 relating to U.S. states. Stagwell Inc. also had indefinite net operating loss carryforwards of $119,415 which consist of $37,367 relating to U.S. federal, and $82,048 relating to U.S. states. Stagwell Inc. also has foreign tax credit and general business carryovers of $6,644 which expire between 2024 and 2031. 
Stagwell Inc.’s consolidated corporate subsidiaries also have net operating loss carryforwards of $49,026 which expire in years 2022 through 2044. These definite lived net operating loss carryforwards consist of $17,411 relating to U.S. federal, $28,879 relating to U.S. states and $2,736 relating to non-U.S. The corporate subsidiaries also have indefinite net operating loss carryforwards of $21,639. These indefinite loss carryforwards consist of $8,840 relating to U.S. federal, and $12,799 relating to non-U.S. The majority of the consolidated corporate subsidiaries' U.S. tax attributes are subject to an annual limitation as a result of historic acquisitions which constituted a change of ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code 382.
The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and considers factors such as the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in eligible carryback years, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.
The Company maintained a valuation allowance of $5,825 as of December 31, 2021 relating to both U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, and $5,551 as of December 31, 2020 relating to U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.
The Company is permanently reinvested with respect to its foreign earnings in certain jurisdictions, and no deferred taxes have been recorded related to such earnings as the determination of the amount is not practicable. The Company currently does not intend to distribute previously taxed income. Upon distribution in the future, the Company may incur state and foreign withholding taxes on such income, the amount of which is not practicable to compute.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits as well as applicable penalties and interest in the amount of $1,120 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accrued penalties and 
Table of Contents

interest included in unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $82 and $0, respectively. If these unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized, it would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 
A reconciliation of the change in unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: | | | | | 
Unrecognized tax benefit - Beginning Balance | $ | — | | | $ | —
Current year positions | — | | | — | | 
Prior period positions | 1,038 | | | — | | 
Settlements | — | | | — | | 
Lapse of statute of limitations | — | | | — | | 
Unrecognized tax benefits - Ending Balance | $ | 1,038 | | | $ | —

 It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by a range of $300 to $400 in the next twelve months as a result of expiration of certain statute of limitations.
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for tax years prior to 2018 are closed for U.S. federal purposes. The statute of limitations for tax years prior to 2011 have also expired in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
18. Fair Value Measurements
A fair value measurement assumes a transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. The hierarchy for observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels are described below: 
•Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
•Level 2 - Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents certain information for our financial liability that is not measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020:

 | December 31, 2021 | | December 31, 2020
 | CarryingAmount | | Fair Value | CarryingAmount | | Fair Value
5.625% Notes | $ | 1,100,000 | | $ | 1,120,900 | | $ | — | $ | —

Our long-term debt includes fixed rate debt. The fair value of this instrument is based on quoted market prices in markets that are not active. Therefore, this debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents certain information for our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020:

 | December 31, 2021 | | December 31, 2020
 | CarryingAmount | | Fair Value | | CarryingAmount | | Fair Value
Interest Rate Swap | $ | 77 | | | $ | 77 | | $ | 416 | $ | 416
Call Options | — | | | — | | | 360 | | 360 
Preferred Shares | — | | | — | | | 12,033 | | 12,033

The interest rate swap and call options are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned preferred shares in a company called Finn Partners. The preferred shares had a cost basis of $10,000, accrued non-cash dividends, on a cost basis, at a rate of 6% annually. The shares were redeemable to cash in the amount of the cost-plus accrued interest at any time after February 28, 2021 or upon a liquidation event and were also convertible to common shares of Finn Partners at any time until February 28, 2021 using a conversion ratio of 1% per $1,000 of preferred shares held including accrued dividends. The conversion feature was not bifurcated and was clearly and closely related to the host instrument, preferred shares. Management determined that the preferred shares were a debt-like financial instrument and should be accounted for as available-for-sale securities at their fair value at each reporting period. These preferred shares were considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement since they utilize unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. 
On March 11, 2021, the Company transferred all of its ownership in the preferred shares. The Company recognized a gain of $1,200 within Gain on sale of business and other, net on the Audited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 related to this transaction.
Contingent deferred acquisition consideration (Level 3 fair value measurement) is recorded at the acquisition date fair value and adjusted at each reporting period. The estimated liability is determined in accordance with models of each business' future performance, including revenue growth and free cash flows. These models are dependent upon significant assumptions, such as the growth rate of the earnings of the relevant subsidiary during the contractual period and the discount rate. These growth rates are consistent with the Company’s long-term forecasts. As of December 31, 2021, the discount rate used to measure these liabilities ranged from 3.5% to 7.2%. 
As these estimates require the use of assumptions about future performance, which are uncertain at the time of estimation, the fair value measurements presented on the Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets are subject to material uncertainty.
See Note 9 of the Notes included herein for additional information regarding contingent deferred acquisition consideration.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying amount of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximated fair value because of their short-term maturity. 
Non-financial Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill, intangible assets (Level 3 fair value measurement) and right-of-use lease assets (Level 2 fair value measurement). Accordingly, these assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment. The Company did not recognize an impairment of goodwill or right-of-use lease assets in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company did recognize an impairment for intangible assets (Level 3 fair value measurement) of $16,187 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and did not recognize an impairment for intangible assets in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. See Note 8 of the Notes included herein for further detail.

20. Segment Information
The Company determines an operating segment if a component (i) engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses, (ii) has discrete financial information, and is (iii) regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is Mark Penn, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, to make decisions regarding resource allocation for the segment and assess its performance. Once operating segments are identified, the Company performs an analysis to determine if aggregation of operating segments is applicable. This determination is based upon a quantitative analysis of the expected and historic average long-term profitability for each operating segment, together with a qualitative assessment to determine if operating segments have similar operating characteristics. 
The CODM uses Adjusted EBITDA (defined below) as a key metric, to evaluate the operating and financial performance of a segment, identify trends affecting the segments, develop projections and make strategic business decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income excluding non-operating income or expense to achieve operating income, plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred acquisition consideration adjustments, and other items. Other items include restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, and non-recurring items. 
The Company has three reportable segments as follows: “Integrated Agencies Network,” “Media Network” and the “Communications Network.” In addition, the Company combines and discloses operating segments that do not meet the aggregation criteria as “All Other.” The Company also reports corporate expenses, as further detailed below, as “Corporate.” All segments follow the same basis of presentation and accounting policies as those described throughout the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
•The Integrated Agencies Network includes four integrated operating segments: the Anomaly Alliance, Constellation, the Code and Theory Network, and the Doner Partner Network. These operating networks are organized for go-to-market and collaboration incentive purposes and to facilitate integrated and flexible offerings for our clients. Each integrated network consists of agencies that offer an array of complementary services spanning our core capabilities of Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, Consumer Insights & Strategy, and Creativity & Communications. The Agencies included in the operating segments that comprise the Integrated Agencies Network reportable segment are as follows: Anomaly Alliance (Anomaly, Concentric, Hunter, Mono, YML and Scout agencies), the Code & Theory Network (Code and Theory, Forsman & Bodenfors, National Research Group, Observatory, Hello Design and Colle McVoy agencies), Constellation (72andSunny, Crispin Porter Bogusky, Instrument, Team Enterprises, Harris and Redscout agencies) and the Doner Partner Network (Doner, KWT Global, Bruce Mau Design, Vitro, Harris X, Northstar, Veritas and Yamamoto agencies).
These integrated network operating segments share similar characteristics related to (i) the nature of their services; (ii) the type of clients and the methods used to provide services; and (iii) the extent to which they may be impacted by global economic and geopolitical risks. In addition, these operating segments may occasionally compete with each other for new business or have business move between them.
•The Media Network reportable segment is comprised of a single operating segment, our specialist network branded the Stagwell Media Network (“SMN”). SMN serves as a unified media and data management structure with omni-channel media placement, creative media consulting, influencer and business-to-business marketing capabilities. Our Agencies in this segment aim to provide scaled creative performance through developing and executing sophisticated omnichannel campaign strategies leveraging significant amounts of consumer data. SMN’s Agencies combine media buying and planning across a range of digital and traditional platforms (out-of-home, paid search, social media, lead generation, programmatic, television, broadcast, among others) and includes multichannel agencies Assembly, Goodstuff, MMI Agency, digital creative & transformation consultancy GALE, B2B specialist Multiview, CX specialists Kenna, and travel media experts Ink.
•The Communications Network reportable segment is comprised of a single operating segment, our specialist network that provides advocacy, strategic corporate communications, investor relations, public relations, online fundraising and other services to both corporations and political and advocacy organizations and consists of our Allison & Partners SKDK (including Sloane & Company), and Targeted Victory Agencies. 
•All Other consists of the Company’s digital innovation group, Reputation Defender (which was sold in September 2021) and Stagwell Marketing Cloud products such as PRophet. 
•Corporate consists of corporate office expenses incurred in connection with the strategic resources provided to the operating segments, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to the operating segments. These office and general expenses include (i) salaries and related expenses for corporate office employees, 
Table of Contents

including employees dedicated to supporting the operating segments, (ii) occupancy expenses relating to properties occupied by all corporate office employees, (iii) other office and general expenses including professional fees for the financial statement audits and other public company costs, and (iv) certain other professional fees managed by the corporate office. Additional expenses managed by the corporate office that are directly related to the operating segments are allocated to the appropriate reportable segment and the All Other category.
