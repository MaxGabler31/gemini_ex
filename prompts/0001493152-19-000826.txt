ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

Our Business
 
We are a shell company as that term is defined under federal securities laws. Our business plan is to seek (i) a new business to enter into; or, (ii) acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business that generates revenues in exchange for our securities. We intend to focus on acquiring cash-flow positive businesses in the People’s Republic of China. We will not limit our opportunities to any particular sector or industry. We believe that China is entering a new era of economic growth, particularly in the Chinese new economy sectors, which we expect will result in attractive acquisition opportunities for us. We believe this growth will be driven by private sector expansion, technological innovation, increasing consumption by the middle class, structural economic and policy reforms, and demographic changes in China.
 
Our new management team is comprised of individuals who have extensive experience investing in and building companies with operations in China. They have experience investing in, building, and operating diversified businesses in the Chinese new economy sectors. Our strategy will be to actively participate in growing, building and operating companies. The objective is to generate additional revenue through, among other things, integration of our portfolio companies; cross-selling; consolidation of management and administrative functions; group-wide procurement; centralizing and minimizing risk; forming strategic partnerships; and, improving management capabilities.
 
This discussion of our business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may not be able to participate in more than one potential business venture because we have nominal assets and limited financial resources. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
 
Plan of Operations
 
We currently plan to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, either (i) enter into a new business; or, (ii) acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business and which is seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12-months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through either entry into a new business or a combination with an existing business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We intend to focus on acquiring cash-flow positive businesses in the People’s Republic of China. We will not limit our opportunities to any particular sector or industry. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the New Board. We have not had any material conversations with potential merger or acquisition targets nor have we entered into any definitive agreement with any party. In our efforts to analyze and evaluate a prospective target business, we will consider several factors, including, without limitation, the following:

● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
● | equity interest retained by our shareholders in the merged entity; 
● | growth potential of the target business; 
● | capital requirements of the target business; 
● | capital available to the target business;

● | stage of development of the target business; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business; 
● | the financial statements of the target business; and 
● | the regulatory environment in which the target business operates. 

 
The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors, as well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial, legal and other information.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time. Our officers and directors will not work full-time for the Company. However, they do intend to devote such time as they deem reasonably necessary to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon, among other things, whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination.
 
We anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, including, possibly, from our officers and directors. The way we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, our respective needs and desires as well as those of the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of ourselves and such promoters.
 
It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), depends upon the issuance to the shareholders of the acquired company of at least 80% of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior shareholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior shareholders may retain substantially less than 10% of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our shareholders prior to such reorganization.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of our management without any vote or approval by shareholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our Company, it will likely be necessary to call a shareholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval, if possible.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.

During the year ended March 31, 2018 we did not engage in any business activities that provided us with positive cash flows. As such, the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12-months and beyond will be paid with funds raised through other sources, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The Company, at this time, does not intend to obtain funds in one or more private placements to finance the operation of any acquired business opportunity until such time as the Company has successfully consummated such a merger or acquisition or entered into a new business. Rather, the Company intends to borrow money to finance ongoing operations.
 
Government Regulations
 
The Company’s common stock is a “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as the Company’s common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell our common stock.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
We have no current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis.
Need for Government Approval of Products or Services
 
We are not required to apply for or have any government approval for our products or services.
 
Research and Development Costs During the Last Two Years
 
We have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.
 
Competition
 
The Company will remain an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than the Company. In view of the Company’s extremely limited financial resources and limited management availability, the Company will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to the Company’s competitors.
Employees
 
The Company currently has no employees. The business of the Company will be managed by its officers and directors, each of whom may join the Company as an employee in the future. The Company does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees at this time.
Available Information
 
The Company expects to continue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Any materials filed by the Company with the SEC may be read and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the SEC’s Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information that issuers (including the Company) file electronically with the SEC. The Internet address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov. At some point in the near future we intend to make our reports, amendments thereto, and other information available, free of charge, on a website for the Company. At this time, the Company does not maintain a website and there is no estimate for when such a website will be maintained by the Company. Our corporate offices are located at 23 Corporate Plaza, Suite 150, Newport Beach, California, 92660. Our telephone number is 949-629-2534.
