ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a global business-to-business gaming technology company, supplying Virtual Sports (which includes Interactive, comprising the offering of our SBG and Virtual Sports content via our remote gaming server) and Server Based Gaming (“SBG”) products to regulated lottery, betting and gaming operators worldwide through an “omni-channel” distribution strategy. We provide end-to-end digital gaming solutions on our proprietary and secure network, which accommodates a wide range of devices, including land-based gaming machine terminals, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and online computer applications.
 
Our Virtual Sports business designs, develops, markets and distributes ultra-high-definition games that create an always-on sports wagering experience. We believe we have a strong position in the supply of Virtual Sports gaming products, with a wide product offering available. As of September 30, 2018, our Virtual Sports products were available in more than 35,000 retail channels and on more than 300 websites. Our products are installed in over 35 gaming jurisdictions worldwide, including the UK, Italy, Greece and the U.S.
 
Our SBG business designs, develops, markets and distributes a broad portfolio of more traditional games through our digital network architecture. Our SBG products are offered through approximately 33,000 digital terminals in gaming and lottery venues around the world, with approximately 2,900 additional terminals contracted for deployment.
 
Our Virtual Sports products are typically offered to operators on a participation basis, whereby we receive a portion of the gaming revenues generated, plus an upfront software license fee. Our SBG products are typically offered directly to land-based and online casino gaming operators, either: (i) through product sales or (ii) on a participation basis. Because our SBG products are fully digital, they can interact with a central server and are provided on a “distributed” basis, which allows us to realize a number of benefits, including that we are able to access a wider geographic footprint through the internet and proprietary networks. We offer SBG products that are compliant with all requirements in the UK (B2/B3), Italy (’6B) and Greece (G2S).
 
Our customer base includes regulated operators of lotteries, licensed sports bookmakers, gaming and bingo halls, casinos and regulated online operators. Some of our key customers include William Hill, SNAI, Sisal, Lottomatica, Betfred, Paddy Power Betfair, Genting, Bet365, Sky Bet, Fortuna, the Greek Organisation of Football Prognostics S.A. (OPAP S.A.), GVC Holdings Plc (including Ladbrokes Coral) and the Pennsylvania Lottery. Geographically, more than half of our revenues are derived from, and more than half of our non-current assets (excluding goodwill, which is not allocated by region) are attributed to, our UK operations, with the remainder of our revenues derived from, and non-current assets attributed to, Italy, Greece and the rest of the world.
 
Unlike traditional suppliers to the gaming industry, we do not supply traditional slot machines or casino systems. All of our products are provided through multiple channels over a digital network. All of our products are designed to operate within applicable gaming and lottery regulations and all of our customers are regulated gaming or lottery operators.
 
We operate in a highly regulated industry. We and our products, as applicable, are licensed, authorized or certified, as applicable, in a number of major gaming and lottery jurisdictions. Our key licenses, authorizations and certifications include those from the Gambling Commission of Great Britain, the Italian gaming authorities and the Greek gaming authorities, as well as the Licensing Authority of Gibraltar, the Alderney Gambling Control Commission, the Belgian Commission, Autorité Des Marchés Financiers (Quebec), State of Oregon’s Division of Gaming Enforcement and the State of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. We are a member of key industry associations, including the Gaming Standards Association, the World Lottery Association and the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers. 
 
Our most recent fiscal year ended on September 30, 2018. On September 24, 2018, our Board of Directors determined, in accordance with our bylaws and the recommendation of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, to change our fiscal year, so that it begins on January 1 and ends on December 31 of each year, starting on January 1, 2019. We intend to file a transition report on Form 10-Q, covering the transition period of October 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, following the conclusion of that transition period. 
  
Our Products
 
We operate our business in two business segments – Virtual Sports (which includes Interactive) and Server Based Gaming – representing our different products and services. Our Interactive business comprises the offering of our SBG and Virtual Sports content via our remote gaming server. Our products in both the Virtual Sports and Server Based Gaming categories both offer innovative games, available through a variety of distribution channels, including digital SBG terminals, mobile gaming products, computer and online gaming products and services and electronic table games (“ETG”). We believe our omni-channel distribution is an important differentiator of our products in the market, allowing us to update our game and operating software remotely and keep pace with fast-evolving requirements in game play, security, technology and regulations.
 
Virtual Sports offers ultra-high-definition games that create an always-on sports wagering experience, while SBG offers more traditional casino games such as slots, roulette and other table games. Our Virtual Sports game portfolio includes branded titles such as Rush Football 2®, Matchday, 1st Down, Virtual Grand National, Rush Boxing® featuring Mike Tyson, as well as greyhounds other horse racing products, tennis, motor racing, cricket, speedway, golf and darts. We offer a comprehensive array of sports titles in Virtual Sports.

Our SBG game portfolio includes a broad selection of leading omni-channel slots titles including the CenturionTM, game family and Super Hot FruitsTM featuring Sizzling Hot spins game family. These games offer customers a wide range of volatilities, return-to-player and other special features. We also offer a range of more traditional casino games through its SBG network, such as roulette, blackjack and numbers games.
 
Virtual Sports
 
We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of Virtual Sports gaming products in the world. We offer a wide range of sports and numbers games to more than 40,000 retail channels and more than 100 websites. Our customers are many of the largest operators in lottery, gaming and betting worldwide. We also supply Virtual Sports and other digital games to mobile and online operators in the UK, the U.S. states of Nevada and New Jersey, Gibraltar and other regulated, EU markets, including Italy, Greece and Denmark. Virtual Sports can be adapted to function in sports betting, lottery, or gaming environments and is therefore available to a wide range of customers in both public and private implementations.
 
Our Virtual Sports product comprises a complex software and networking package that provides fixed odds wagering on an ultra-high definition computer rendering of a simulated sporting event, such as soccer or boxing. Players can bet on the simulated sporting event, in both a streaming and on-demand environment, overcoming the relative infrequency of live sporting events. We have developed this product using an award-winning TV and film graphics team with advanced motion capture techniques.
 
In addition to soccer and boxing, our virtual sports products also include tennis, speedway (track motorcycle racing), motorcar racing (single seater style and stock cars), velodrome cycle racing, greyhound and horse racing, basketball, boxing, darts and cricket, as well as various lottery ball draw and other numbers games. We have also licensed the use of images of certain sports figures in our games, including boxer Mike Tyson. We also entered into a partnership with CARM productions and Aintree Race Course to create the second Virtual Grand National, which aired on live UK television and successfully predicted the 2018 winner Tiger Roll.
 
Our customers together offer Virtual Sports events to millions of their customers, through land-based, online and mobile platforms, many of them available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and often concurrently within the same location. We have launched a remote game server Virtual Sports product, which enables the provision of on-demand Virtual Sports events alongside the scheduled events Virtual Sports events that have so far predominated in our product offerings.
 
In addition to on-demand Virtual Sports, our Virgo RGS™ offers a wide range of premium slots from feature-rich bonus games to European-style casino free spins, and table games incorporating well-known first and third-party brands including 20p Roulette and Mike Tyson Blackjack. Inspired releases several new titles per month and new games can be seamlessly deployed to the full estate of operators via its Virgo RGS™. Inspired’s Virgo RGS™ is integrated with a number of leading casino brands, including William Hill, Ladbrokes Coral, Bet365, Bwin, Paddy Power, Betfair, Sky Bingo, Bet Victor, Rank, Leo Vegas, Mr Green and Aspire Global.
 
Server Based Gaming (SBG)
 
We supply SBG products, offering games through approximately 33,000 digital terminals in gaming and lottery venues around the world, with approximately 2,900 additional terminals contracted for deployment. Because our SBG products are fully digital, they can interact with a central server and are provided on a “distributed” basis, which allows us to realize a number of benefits, including that we are able to access a wider geographic footprint through the internet and proprietary networks. We offer SBG products that are compliant with all requirements in the UK (B2/B3), Italy (’6B) and Greece (G2S).
 
We have a strong market position in the UK, where our SBG terminals account for a material portion of all SBG terminal placements and we offer over 100 games. We are also a material player in Italy and Greece. We offer SBG terminals such as the Flex4k curved screen, Eclipse, Inceptor, Optimus and Blaze, each offering a different size terminal, graphics, technology and price proposition.
 
We distribute games to devices via different Game Management Systems (“GMSs”), each tailored to a specific operator and market type. Our CORETM system is designed for distributed street-gaming markets and uses Inspired or third-party cabinets in combination with Inspired Inside, and gaming content from a wide portfolio of independent game developers. CORE-CONNECT is our American Gaming Association G2S standard-based Video Lottery Terminal (“VLT”) platform, currently deployed in the Greek VLT market. CORE EDGETM is the next iteration of our GMSs, and uses our Virgo remote gaming server (“RGS”), which is also used to power our web-based and mobile content delivery platform. This system, and the HTML5-based games that are deployed on it, mean that we can offer a genuine omni-channel game experience.

Our Strategy
 
We are focused on executing on key strategies to achieve long-term growth in revenues, profit and cash flow. We achieve our targets by delivering innovative and differentiated products that provide value to our customers and exciting experiences to their players in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. We place great emphasis on developing creative solutions, in terms of game content and play, that deliver and sustain superior performance for networked, distributed, omni-channel gaming. This omni-channel strategy allows us to update our games and operating software remotely, keeping pace with evolving requirements in game play, security, technology and regulations.
 
Our key strategic priorities are as follows:
 
Extend our strong positions in each of Virtual Sports and Server Based Gaming by developing new omni-channel products.
 
We continually invest in new product development in each of our Virtual Sports and Server Based Gaming business segments. We believe these investments benefit our existing and new customers by making new products and services available to them and bringing exciting entertainment experiences to their players. Our digital approach, which connects our content to a wide range of devices and is compatible with a wide range of protocols and regulatory standards, is a differentiator in our industry and creates a significant competitive advantage for us. We have continued to focus on channels where we believe there is considerable growth available – especially mobile, where we can deploy our RGS products. We believe our technological approach allows us to quickly adapt to changes in player preferences.
 
Continue to invest in games and technology in order to grow our existing customers’ revenues.
 
Over the last three years, a substantial portion of our annual revenue has been recurring and based on long-term contracts with customers. These contracts are in the participation-based portion of our business, where our revenues typically grow in line with the growth of our customers’ gaming revenues from our products. We work closely with our customers to assist in the optimization of their terminal operations so they can achieve growth in revenues, which we believe is to our benefit. Accordingly, we continually invest in new game and technology offerings that we believe will enable our customers to keep their offerings fresh and allow them to offer their players new forms of entertainment. In some instances, we must develop new software and content to comply with new regulatory requirements and try to mitigate the impact. We believe our game development is a key aspect of our strategy. We intend to continue this strategic priority in both our Virtual Sports and Server Based Gaming businesses.
 
Add new customers by expanding into underpenetrated markets while further penetrating existing markets.
 
We believe that our historical growth has been driven by our entry into new geographies as well as increasing our share in existing markets, and we expect such expansion to continue. We also intend to seek opportunities to enter new product markets where we believe that we may enjoy competitive advantages. We believe North America is a major gaming market in which we currently have limited participation, but where our products are well positioned, or can be positioned, for future success. For example, we have recently commenced the placement of our products in North America with the Pennsylvania Lottery and have signed contracts with internet gaming platform providers for the placement of our products in New Jersey. We are also leveraging our technology and experience in Greece, where we are compliant with the Game to System (G2S) protocol, to create differentiated products for the North American distributed gaming market.
 
Pursue targeted mergers and acquisitions to expand our product portfolio and distribution footprint.
 
In addition to growing our business organically, we continue to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities that will help strengthen and scale our operations and take further advantage of our competitive position in digital gaming. Our management team shares a combination of operating, investing, financial and transactional experience that we believe will serve the Company well as it seeks to identify opportunities for value-adding acquisitions and negotiate and close on beneficial acquisition transactions.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We intend to execute our strategy by leveraging the following competitive strengths:
 
Significant Base of Operations with Recurring Revenue from Long-Term Relationships
 
Over the last three years, a substantial portion of our annual revenue has been recurring and based on long-term contracts with customers. Our customers include major blue-chip lottery, sports betting and gaming operators (both land-based and online) within the regulated UK and European markets. Many of our customer relationships are long-standing and in excess of 10 years.
Strong Position in Virtual Sports
 
Our Virtual Sports products currently generate over $10 billion in player wagers per year. Inspired’s award-winning Virtual Sports products offer a wide range of betting markets and what we consider to be superior graphics. Our Virtual Sports revenue is fast growing and high margin, and complements our recurring-revenue base, which is itself growing.

History of Strong Content Development
 
We deploy over 100 new games, variants and 3rd party titles per year across our GMSs and RGS systems. Many of our recent game launches, including Maximus PayusTM, Maid MarianTM, and Super Hot FruitsTM (a consistent top performer in the Greek market) have been omni-channel, offering a premium player experience across multiple platforms.
Omni-Channel Digital Gaming Platform
 
Our proprietary digital gaming platform has been developed internally by development teams based in the UK and the EU. We offer SBG products that are compliant with all requirements in the UK (B2/B3), Italy (’6B) and Greece (G2S) technical regulations. Our 100% digital, omni-channel platform is able to deliver our content and user experience to devices ranging from SBG terminals to mobile devices.
Experienced Management Team
 
Our seasoned management team is led by our Executive Chairman Lorne Weil, who is known as a gaming industry innovator and whose past leadership includes growing a diversified global gaming technology company both organically and through extensive acquisitions and joint ventures further bolstering the business. In May 2018, we formed the Office of the Executive Chairman, which consists of our Executive Chairman; our President and Chief Operating Officer Brooks H. Pierce; our Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer Daniel B. Silvers; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Stewart F.B. Baker. The Office of the Executive Chairman executes the day-to-day management of the Company. Our management team has broad and deep experience in the gaming industry, working with lotteries, casino operators, betting platforms, and online operators. Mr. Weil and Mr. Pierce have over 50 years of experience in the gaming industry between them and relationships with customers around the world, helping them build and sustain revenue growth. In addition, both Mr. Weil and Mr. Silvers have centered their careers on identifying and implementing value creation initiatives, often through acquisitions or other transactional means, and Mr. Pierce, Mr. Baker and other members of our management team are experienced with the acquisition and integration of businesses.  Mr. Baker has institutional knowledge at Inspired and in-depth financial expertise.
Industry Overview
 
We operate within the global gaming and lottery industry. Global gaming and lottery growth has been resilient in the face of economic cycles over the last decade. According to H2 Gambling Capital, the industry has grown at a 2.7% compounded annual growth rate from 2007 to 2017, driven by increased consumer spend and the introduction of new regulated markets.  
 
During this period, digital online and mobile gaming and lottery have grown at a faster pace. According to H2 Gambling Capital, this portion of the industry has grown at a 10.6% compound annual growth rate, driven by rapid growth in the deployment of digital games and technologies, such as Virtual Sports and digital SBG terminals, into land-based venues in the primary markets in which we operate, where regulators have supported the transition to digital, online and retail channels.
 
We believe that the overall global gaming and lottery industry will continue to grow, with more robust growth in the digital gaming and lottery markets. We believe the industry is content driven and, much like music, videogames and motion pictures, will continue to be transformed by the propagation of digitally-networked technologies.
 
As a gaming and lottery business-to-business supplier focused on digital products and technologies, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.
 
Influencers of Digital Adoption
 
We believe the digital segment of the global gaming and lottery industry will continue to grow, including as a result of the following factors:
 
Governments: Opening of new gaming territories. Many national and state governments operating in developed economies in Europe and the United States are suffering from structural funding deficits. The regulation and liberalization of gaming and lottery is frequently relied upon to raise new sources of revenue for these governments. In most cases, we believe such liberalization does not favor buildouts of large new destination resort casinos, but rather focuses on smaller “edge” venues with lottery, gaming and sports betting, combined with online or mobile gaming.
 
Digital Multi-Channel Offerings: Replacement of legacy analogue machines with larger volume of smart digital devices, including retail and mobile. In many established markets, as existing gaming terminals mature, governments and regulatory authorities have implemented regulations to upgrade the established terminal base to digital operation.
 
Smartphones and Mobile Devices: Rapid adoption of gaming and lottery applications on growing volume. In certain markets, mobile play on sports betting and gaming now exceeds such play on personal computers. According to H2 Gambling Capital, mobile gaming revenues in such markets exhibited a 55% compounded annual growth rate between 2008 and 2017. Mobile gaming and lottery is now expanding in other markets, and mobile play has recently been approved in other markets for gaming or lottery.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we believe there are significant benefits for SBG operators in the adoption of digitally networked gaming and lottery. SBG allows operators to remotely manage their operations with minimal disruption to their businesses. The system centralization enabled by digital operations offers flexibility to rotate or change games, tailor game availability to time-of-day, target specific player demographics and take advantage of seasonal and themed marketing opportunities. New games can be phased in without the revenue dip often associated with replacing games on traditional slot machines. In addition, digital operations permit more games per terminal, enabling operators to test new games and new suppliers, seek to appeal to a broader base of players with minimal cost or risk, commission games from third-party party suppliers on an open game interface and reduce procurement risk. Moreover, digital operations significantly reduce the need for on-site repairs, improve terminal up-time and should extend terminal life cycles as well as the time period over which capital costs can be depreciated.

Regulatory Framework 
 
We conduct business in a number of different jurisdictions, of which Great Britain and Italy have historically contributed the most significant recurring revenues. The gaming regulator responsible for our activities in Great Britain is the Gambling Commission of Great Britain (the “UK Gambling Commission” or the “Gambling Commission”). In Italy, the operation of gaming machines and remote gaming is regulated by L’Agenzia delle dogane e dei Monopoli (“ADM”). In addition, we are licensed or certified (as applicable) by the Greek gaming authorities and in a number of other jurisdictions by regulators such as the Licensing Authority of Gibraltar, the Alderney Gambling Control Commission , the Belgian Commission, Autorité Des Marchés Financiers (Quebec), State of Oregon’s Division of Gaming Enforcement and the State of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.
Great Britain
 
In the British market, we supply and distribute Category B2 gaming machines (also known as Fixed-Odd Betting Terminals, or FOBTs, with maximum betting stakes for players of £100), B3 gaming machines (with maximum betting stakes for players of £2) and ETG machines to third parties who are licensed to operate such machines in bricks-and-mortar premises. B2 gaming machines can include B3 content on them. We also supply virtual racing software to local retail venues and to online operators who are licensed to target the British market. We also supply our Interactive product to remote operators who are licensed to target the British market. The provision of our products and services in relation to the British market is authorized by a series of licenses issued by the UK Gambling Commission, namely remote and non-remote Gaming Machine Technical (Full) operating licenses, a remote casino operating license, a remote and non-remote gambling software license and a remote general betting standard (virtual events) license.
 
On November 14, 2018, the UK Government confirmed that the implementation of the £2 maximum bet for B2 content would come into effect as of April 1, 2019.
 
British Betting and Gaming Laws and Regulations. The Gambling Act 2005 (the “GA05”) is the principal legislation in Great Britain governing gambling (other than in relation to the National Lottery, which is governed by separate legislation). The GA05 applies to both land-based gambling (referred to as “non-remote” gambling) and online and mobile gambling (referred to as “remote” gambling).
 
The GA05 provides that it is an offense to make a gaming machine available for use without an appropriate operating license. There are a number of different categories of licensable gaming machines (the GA05 provides for category A to D machines, although no category A machines are currently in operation); each category is subject to different levels of maximum stakes and prize limits. In addition, there are limits on the numbers and types of gaming machines that can be operated from licensed premises: for example, a licensed betting office is permitted to house up to four category B2 to D machines, while a large casino may house up to 150 category B to D machines (subject to satisfying certain ratios of machines to gaming tables).
 
Gaming machine suppliers are required to hold an operating license in order to manufacture, supply, install, adapt, maintain or repair a gaming machine or part of a gaming machine. Gaming machine suppliers must also comply with the Gaming Machine Technical Standards published by the Gambling Commission in relation to each category of machine, and such machines must meet the appropriate testing requirements.
 
In relation to remote gambling, the GA05 (as amended by the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014 provides that it is an offense to “provide facilities” for remote gambling either (a) using “remote gambling equipment” situated in Great Britain, or (b) which are used by players situated in Great Britain, in each case without a remote gambling operating license. It is also an offense to manufacture, supply, install or adapt gambling software in Great Britain without an appropriate gambling software license.
 
A remote gambling operating license holder providing facilities for remote gambling to British players is required to use gambling software manufactured and supplied by the holder of a gambling software license (and to failure to do so is an offence). Where gambling software is used or supplied for use in relation to the British market, it must satisfy the Remote Gambling and Software Technical Standards published by the Gambling Commission.
 
The holder of a British gambling operating license is subject to a variety of ongoing regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the following:
 

● | Shareholder disclosure: An entity holding a gambling license must notify the Gambling Commission of the identity of any shareholder holding 3% or more of the equity or voting rights in the entity (whether held or controlled either directly or indirectly). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8



● | Change of corporate control: Whenever a new person becomes a “controller” (as defined in section 422 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) of a company limited by shares that holds a gambling operating license, the licensed entity must apply to the Gambling Commission for permission to continue to rely on its operating license in light of the new controller. A new controller includes any person who holds or controls (directly or indirectly, including ultimate beneficial owners who hold their interest through a chain of ownership) 10% or more of the equity or voting rights in the licensed entity (or who is otherwise able to exercise “significant influence” over it). The Gambling Commission must be supplied with specified information regarding the new controller (which, in the case of an individual, includes detailed personal disclosure) and this information will be reviewed by the Gambling Commission to assess the suitability of the new controller to be associated with a licensed entity. If the Gambling Commission concludes that it would not have issued the operating license to the licensed entity had the new controller been a controller when the application for the operating license was made, the Gambling Commission is required to revoke the operating license. It is possible to apply for approval in advance from the Gambling Commission prior to becoming a new controller of a licensed entity. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance with the License Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP): The LCCP is a suite of license conditions and code provisions which attach to operating licenses issued by the Gambling Commission. The provision of gambling facilities in breach of a license condition is an offense under the GA05. Certain specified “Social Responsibility” code provisions are accorded the same weight as license conditions in this regard (whereas breach of an “ordinary” code provision is not an offense in itself, but may be evidence of unsuitability to continue to hold a gambling license). The LCCP imposes numerous operational requirements on licensees, including compliance with the Gambling Commission’s Remote Gambling and Software Technical Standards, segregation of customer funds, the implementation of a variety of social responsibility tools (such as self-exclusion), anti-money laundering measures, age verification of customers and a host of consumer protection measures. The Gambling Commission regularly reviews and revises the LCCP. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulatory returns and reporting of key events: The LCCP requires licensees to submit quarterly returns to the Gambling Commission detailing prescribed operational data. Licensees are also required to notify the Gambling Commission as soon as practicable and in any event within 5 working days of becoming aware of the occurrence of certain specified “key events” which, in summary, are events which could have a significant impact on the nature or structure of the licensee’s business. Licensees are also required to notify suspicion of offenses and suspicious gambling activity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Personal licenses: Key management personnel are required to maintain personal licenses authorizing them to discharge certain responsibilities on behalf of the operator. These personal licenses are subject to renewal every five years. Personal licenses are subject to compliance with certain license conditions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Italy
 
We operate two different gaming businesses in Italy. We supply video lottery terminals (“VLTs”), including the terminal machines themselves, the related online platforms and the games available on the machines, to brick-and-mortar gaming halls. We also supply Virtual Sports products, including online platforms and games, to betting shops and online platforms. Our businesses are operated through the Italian branches of certain of our UK subsidiaries. These branches hold police licenses and are enrolled in the Register of Gestori, as further described below. We supply our Italian VLTs and Virtual Sports products only to operators licensed under Italian gaming laws and regulations.
 
Our VLT and Virtual Sports platforms must be connected over the internet to servers operated by the ADM. Information regarding gaming sessions and the amounts wagered and won is provided in real time through the ADM servers, in order to enable the ADM to monitor the operation of machines and games and to verify the amount of taxes due.
 
Italian Betting and Gaming Laws and Regulations. Operators of betting premises offering VLTs (including the entities managing the networks connecting such VLTs to ADM servers), and operators of betting premises or online platforms offering Virtual Sports products, must hold an Italian gaming license. No gaming license is required in order to supply VLTs or Virtual Sports products to such operators. Such VLT platforms, machines and games, and Virtual Sports platforms and games, must be certified and approved by SOGEI, an entity authorized to conduct such certifications, and approved by the Italian Ministry of Finance. Such certifications and approvals must be obtained by such operators, rather than the suppliers of such VLT platforms, machines and games, and Virtual Sports platforms and games.
 
Suppliers of gaming machines, including VLTs, must hold a police license (as prescribed by article 86, paragraph 3, of the Italian United Text of Public Security Law (TULPS) provided by the Royal Decree 18 June 1931, No. 773) and be enrolled in a registry prescribed by article 1, paragraph 82 of Law No. 220/2010 (known as the “Register of Gestori”). If a supplier of gaming machines is not enrolled in the Register of Gestori, any agreement it enters into regarding the supply of gaming machines is null and void. In addition, if the enrollment is not renewed, existing agreements regarding the supply of gaming machines become null and void. Enrollment in the Register of Gestori is subject to, among other things, a review of the suitability of the applicant business entity and its directors. In the event of a change of control of the entity enrolled in the Register of Gestori (but not of such entity’s direct or indirect parent entities), the details of such change must be notified to the ADM and suitability must be reconfirmed.

Suppliers of Virtual Sports products are not required to hold a police license, be enrolled in the Register of Gestori or otherwise be licensed or registered.
 
ADM Decree No. 37100, dated April 4, 2017, requires that VLT platforms, machines and games undergo a substantial technical upgrade by April 1, 2019. In absence of such an upgrade, a VLT supplier would be in breach of any agreements with its operators to remain in compliance with Italian gaming laws and regulations, and its platforms and machines would no longer be authorized to offer games and we are working towards compliance of this.
 
Greece
 
In Greece, we supply VLTs, including the terminal machines themselves, the related online platforms and the games available on the machines, to brick-and-mortar gaming locations operated by OPAP, the country’s sole licensed operator of gaming machines. We supply such VLTs under a certification provided by the Hellenic Gaming Commission (the “HGC”). We also supply Virtual Sports products within retail venues operated by OPAP and via self-service betting terminals within OPAP venues.
 
Greek Betting and Gaming Laws and Regulations. According to articles 25(b) and 44 par. 2 of Law 4002/2011 as in force, as well as according to HGC’s Decision No 225/2/25.10.2016, all suppliers of gaming machines in Greece must be certified by the HGC in order to legally supply, sell, lease, offer or distribute any VLT or virtual game or any other game of chance (i.e. games including wagers or bets and the result of which games depends, even partly, on the influence of luck). Suppliers are divided into two types, manufacturers and importers/distributors (according to articles 47 and 48 of the aforementioned HGC’s Decision). In order for a manufacturer to receive certification, it must satisfy the HGC as to its corporate and financial status and must not have been denied a gaming license or certification in any other country. In order for an importer/distributor to receive certification, it must satisfy the HGC as to its corporate and financial status, must not have been denied a gaming license or certification in any other country and must have the approval of the manufacturer to supply its products in the Greek market.
 
Gaming Regulation and Changes in Ownership
 
In all of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to gaming regulations, regulators require us to keep them informed as to our ownership structure and composition and, to varying extents and in various circumstances, require us to disclose certain information regarding the persons who directly or indirectly hold our shares. Depending on the regulator, we may need to provide such information not only when we first seek licenses or certifications, but also when material changes (measured at different levels) occur in the ownership of our shares. As a result, material changes in our shareholdings may be subject to special procedures in order to ensure the continuation of our gaming licenses and certifications.
Content Development
 
We continually invest in new product development in each of our Virtual Sports and Server Based Gaming business segments. Inspired has a full stack game development structure, combining its own leading technology frameworks together with some of the industry’s best math, art, creative and production personnel, along with a select few external development teams to deliver the best in omni-channel mobile and VLT games. We deploy over 100 new games, variants and 3rd party titles per year across our GMSs and RGS systems. Many of our recent game launches, including Maximus PayusTM, Maid MarianTM, and Super Hot FruitsTM (a consistent top performer in the Greek market) have been omni-channel, offering a premium player experience across multiple platforms. In Virtual Sports we combine graphical assets and software that controls those assets to schedule events and generate results via a random number generator, as well as supplying on demand versions of our content. We account for our development costs as software development costs and these are typically amortized over a two-year period.
Suppliers
 
Our principal supply arrangements concern the supply of our SBG terminal components, content provision and outsourced labor. We work closely with our key suppliers to ensure a high level of quality of goods and services is obtained and have worked with many of these suppliers for many years. We have achieved significant cost savings through centralization of purchases.
Customers
 
Our customer base includes regulated operators of lotteries, licensed sports bookmakers, gaming and bingo halls, casinos and regulated online operators. Some of our key customers include William Hill, SNAI, Sisal, Lottomatica, Betfred, Paddy Power Betfair, Genting, Bet365, Sky Bet, Fortuna, OPAP S.A., GVC Holdings Plc (including Ladbrokes Coral) and the Pennsylvania Lottery. We typically implement design and content variations to customize their terminals and player experiences. Our license agreements with customers for the provision of SBG content and Virtual Sports products include provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our games and other content.

We have approximately 670 employees, 640 of which are full-time employees. Over 250 of our employees and 70 personnel located with partners are dedicated to delivering our SBG and digital platforms. Approximately 75 of our employees are assigned to the ongoing operation of our network, through which we supply and maintain our products. Approximately 130 of our employees are involved in UK field operations. Our management, sales and administration teams account for approximately 60 employees.
 
The Company has undertaken a review of its operations in order to enable it to reduce its global costs and to more effectively align its resources with its business priorities. In connection with this review, which is continuing, the Company expects, among other things, to consolidate and relocate certain of its operations in the United Kingdom and has implemented, and expects to continue to implement, a related reduction in headcount. These changes continue the Company’s prior cost control efforts. It is anticipated that the relocation, consolidation and headcount reduction will be implemented on an ongoing basis and be completed on or before the end of calendar year 2019. Given the uncertainties relating to the outcome of these efforts and a number of related matters that remain unresolved, the Company is currently unable to accurately estimate the exit-related costs that may arise in connection with the reduction in force.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property consists principally of the propriety software we develop to operate our network and in the design and distribution of our games. We depend upon agreements relating to trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our rights in this intellectual property. We require all our employees, contractors and other collaborators to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of our confidential information to other parties. In addition, it is our policy to require our employees, contractors and other collaborators who have access to proprietary and trade secret material to enter into agreements that require them to assign any and all intellectual property rights to us that arise as a result of their work on our behalf. We also require our employees to review and acknowledge our trade secret policies regarding how we handle trade secrets. These agreements, acknowledgements and policies may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure in violation of these agreements, and may not be sufficient to secure for us the value in such developments that they are designed to secure.
 
We also hold certain patents, trademarks, design rights and other intellectual property rights in respect of our products, systems, web domains, and other intellectual property. We also rely on certain products and technologies that we license from third parties. Proprietary licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
 
 Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive industry, and in highly competitive business segments. We face competition from a number of worldwide businesses, many of which have substantially greater financial resources and operating scale than we do. Such competition could adversely affect our ability to win new contracts and sales and renew existing contracts. We operate in a period of intense price-based competition in some key markets, which could affect the profitability of the contracts and sales we do win. In certain markets, our businesses also face competition from suppliers, operators or licensees who offer products for internet gaming in illegal or unregulated markets, but are still able or permitted to supply products and compete with us in regulated markets. These competitors often have substantially greater financial resources and operating scale than we do. Our principal competitors include, among others, certain businesses that have vertically integrated gaming machine and retail betting operations and businesses that operate in both regulated and unregulated markets and thereby effectively subsidize their regulated operations with unregulated operations.
Seasonality
 
Our revenues are subject to a number of variations. Equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions, which may not recur on an annual basis. Consequently, revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of equipment sales and software licensing. In addition, revenues may vary depending on the timing of contract awards and renewals, changes in customer budgets and general economic conditions. However, our revenues are not subject to regular seasonal variations of the sort often related to seasonal consumer behavior, except that in Italy and Greece we experience reductions in revenue in the summer and in the UK, Italy and Greece we experience increases in revenue around customers’ pay dates.
