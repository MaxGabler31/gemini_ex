Item 1. Business
The Company
Tecogen Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” or “us,” or “Tecogen”) designs, manufactures, markets, and maintains high efficiency, ultra-clean cogeneration products. These include natural gas engine driven combined heat and power (CHP) systems, chillers and heat pumps for multi-family residential, commercial, recreational and industrial use. We are known for products that provide customers with substantial energy savings, resiliency from utility power outages and for significantly reducing a customer’s carbon footprint. Our products are sold with our patented Ultera® emissions technology which nearly eliminates all criteria pollutants such as NOx and CO. We are also developing Ultera® for other applications including stationary engines and forklifts. See "Our Products - Ultera Low-Emissions Technology" for a more in-depth discussion of our Ultera emissions technology. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 15, 2000.
We have wholly-owned subsidiaries American DG Energy, Inc. ("ADGE") and Tecogen CHP Solutions, Inc., and we own a 51% interest in American DG New York, LLC ("ADGNY"), a joint venture. ADGE and ADGNY distribute, own, and operate clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water, heat and cooling. ADGE owns the equipment that it installs at a customer’s facility and sells the energy produced by its systems to the customer on a long-term contractual basis.

Recent Developments
COVID-19 Update
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began spreading rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted supply chains, curtailed global economic activity, and caused significant volatility and disruption in global markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by U.S. Federal, state and local governments in response have materially adversely affected and could in the future materially impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The impact of the pandemic remains uncertain and will depend on the growth in the number of infections, fatalities, the duration of the pandemic, steps taken to combat the pandemic, and the development and availability of effective treatments. We have made every effort to keep our employees who operate our business safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
On April 17, 2020, we obtained an unsecured loan in the principal amount of $1,874,200 from Webster Bank, NA ("Webster") under the Paycheck Protection Program adopted pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Recovery Act, as amended ("CARES Act"). The loan was forgivable if the proceeds were utilized by us for payroll, utilities, and rent expenses. On January 19, 2021 we received confirmation from Webster that the Paycheck Protection Program Loan in the original principal amount of $1,874,200 together with accrued interest of $13,659 was forgiven in full effective as of January 11, 2021. The loan forgiveness of $1,887,859 was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and is reported as a separate component of other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw Loan
On February 5, 2021, we obtained a Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw unsecured loan through Webster in the amount of $1,874,269 in connection with the Paycheck Protection Program pursuant to the CARES Act. The loan is guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration. On September 20, 2021, we received a letter dated September 13, 2021 from Webster Bank, NA confirming that the Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw Loan issued to us pursuant to the CARES Act in the original principal amount of $1,874,269 together with accrued interest of $11,386 was forgiven in full as of September 8, 2021. The loan forgiveness of $1,885,655 was accounted for as debt extinguishment and is reported as a separate component of other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Employee Retention Credit
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law providing numerous tax incentives and other stimulus measures, including an employee retention credit (“ERC”), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended and expanded the availability of the ERC. The ERC was available with respect to periods through October 1, 2021 and was equal to 70% of qualified wages (which includes employer qualified health plan expenses) paid to employees. In addition, the availability of the ERC was permitted to entities that received a Paycheck Protection Loan subject to certain conditions. During each quarter in 2021, a maximum of $10,000 in qualified wages for each employee was eligible for the ERC. Therefore, the maximum tax credit that can be claimed by an eligible employer in 2021 is $7,000 per employee per calendar quarter. Section 2301(c)(2)(B) of the CARES Act permits an employer to use an alternative quarter to calculate gross receipts and the employer may determine if the decline in gross receipts tests is met for a calendar quarter in 2021 by comparing its gross receipts for the immediately preceding calendar quarter with those for the corresponding calendar quarter in 2019. Accordingly, for the first quarter of 2021, we elected to use our gross receipts for the fourth calendar quarter of 2020 compared to our gross receipts for the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. As a result of our election to use an alternative quarter, we qualified for the ERC in the first, second and third quarters of 2021 because our gross receipts decreased by more than 20% from the first, second and third quarters of 2019. As a result of averaging 500 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, all wages paid to employees in the first, second and third quarters of 2021 were eligible for the ERC. Note, wages used towards PPP loan forgiveness can not be used as qualified wages for purposes of the ERC. During the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded ERC benefits of $1,276,021 shown in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and such claimed ERCs are disclosed within accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet.    Air Cooled Chiller Development
In Q3 2021 we began development on a hybrid air-cooled chiller. We recognized that there were many applications where the customer wanted an easy to install roof top chiller. Using the inverter design from our InVerde e+ cogeneration module, we developed the novel concept of a hybrid chiller. This system can simultaneously take two inputs, one from the grid or a renewable energy source and one from our natural gas engine. This allows a customer to have the optimum blend of operational cost savings and greenhouse gas benefits while providing added resiliency from two power sources. We expect to have a prototype operational by Q4 2022 and to see incremental revenue by the early part of 2023. A provisional patent based on this concept has been filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office. 
Energy Sales Agreements
On December 14, 2018, we entered into agreements relating to the sale of two energy purchase agreements and related energy production systems for $2 million and on March 5, 2019 entered into agreements relating to the sale of six energy purchase agreements and related energy production systems for $5 million.  In connection with these sales, we entered into agreements to provide billing and asset management services and operations and maintenance services for agreed fees for the duration of the energy purchase agreements, pursuant to which we guarantee certain minimum collections and are entitled to receive fifty percent of the excess of collections over agreed minimum thresholds. In October 2021 the minimum guarantee with respect to one of the energy purchase agreements was modified by reducing the guaranteed minimum collections by $35,000 per year, the guaranteed minimum collection amount associated with one site that was sold by the customer. 
ADGE Merger
On May 18, 2017, our stockholders approved the acquisition of ADGE in a stock for stock merger together with the issuance of the stock by us in the transaction (“Merger”). As a result of the Merger, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of ADGE and ADGE became our wholly-owned subsidiary. See Note 4. "Acquisition of American DG Energy, Inc." of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Overview of Our Business
Tecogen products offer customers energy savings, resiliency and a cleaner environmental footprint. Our cogeneration, chiller and heat pump systems use an engine to generate electricity or shaft work and recover the waste heat from the engine. Our systems are greater than 88% efficient compared to typical electrical grid efficiencies of 40% to 50%. As a result, our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are typically half that of the electrical grid. Our systems generate electricity and hot water or in the case of our Tecochill product, both chilled water and hot water. Our products are expected to run on Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) as it is introduced into the US gas pipeline infrastructure.
Our natural gas-powered cogeneration systems (also known as combined heat and power or “CHP”) are efficient because they drive electric generators or compressors, which reduce the amount of electricity purchased from the utility while recovering the engine’s waste heat for water heating, space heating, and/or air conditioning at the customer’s building. 
TECOGEN INC.

Our commercial product lines include:
•the InVerde e+® and TecoPower® cogeneration units; these systems supply electricity and hot water;
•Tecochill® air-conditioning and refrigeration chillers; these systems produce chilled water and hot water;
•Tecofrost® gas engine-driven refrigeration compressors; these systems circulate refrigerant and provide hot water as a byproduct;
•Ilios® high-efficiency water heaters; These provide hot water at a significantly higher efficiency than a conventional boiler (250% vs 75%); 
•Ultera® emissions control technology.
Traditional customers for our InVerde and Tecopower products have a simultaneous need for electrical power and hot water. These include hospitals, nursing homes, schools, universities, health clubs, spas, hotels and motels, office and multi-unit residential buildings. Conversely our Tecochill product benefits customers who have a simultaneous need for cooling and hot water which is typical in sites such as hospitals, ice rinks, indoor agriculture and food processing. Our Tecofrost refrigeration compressors are applied primarily to industrial applications that include cold storage, wineries, dairies, ice rinks and food processing. Market drivers include the price of natural gas, local electricity rates, environmental regulations, and governmental energy policies, as well as customers’ desire to become more environmentally responsible.
Our cooling and refrigeration products provide both cooling and high grade waste heat. This is of particular advantage in facilities that control both temperature and humidity. In such facilities, climate control is achieved by cooling the facility to remove humidity and then reheating to the required temperature. Using engine waste heat to perform the reheat while utilizing natural gas to generate the cooling provides significant economic and environmental benefits. As a result our product has significant competitive advantages in applications that operate year round such as controlled environment agriculture, indoor ice rinks, and hospitals.
Through our factory service centers in California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Toronto, Canada, our specialized technical staff maintains our products via long-term service contracts. To date we have shipped over 3,000 units, some of which have been operating for almost 35 years. We established a service center in Toronto, Canada in August 2020 to support our existing population of chillers and cogeneration units including 26 cogeneration units sold in this territory during 2020 to serve public housing facilities. 
In 2009, in response to the changing regulatory requirements for stationary engines, our research team developed an economically feasible process for removing air pollutants from engine exhaust. This technology's U.S. and foreign patents were granted beginning in October 2013 and other domestic and foreign patents granted or applications are pending. Branded Ultera®, the ultra-clean emissions technology repositions our engine driven products in the marketplace, making them comparable environmentally with other technologies such as fuel cells, but at a much lower cost and greater efficiency. In 2018, a group of natural gas engine-generators fitted with the Ultera system were successfully permitted in the Los Angeles region for unrestricted operation, the first natural gas engines to do so without operating time limits or other exemption. These engines were permitted to levels matching the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") stringent 2007 emissions requirements, the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells, and the same emissions levels as a state-of-the-art central power plant. We now offer our Ultera emissions control technology as an option on all our products or as a stand-alone application for retrofitting other rich-burn spark-ignited reciprocating internal combustion engines such as the engine-generators described above.
Our products are designed as compact modular units that are intended to be installed in multiples. This approach has significant advantages over utilizing a single larger cogeneration or chiller unit, allowing placement in constrained urban settings and redundancy to mitigate service outages. Redundancy is particularly relevant in regions where the electric utility has formulated tariff structures that include high “peak demand” charges. Such tariffs are common in many areas of the country, and are applied by such utilities as Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, Consolidated Edison of New York, and National Grid of Massachusetts. Because these tariffs are assessed based on customers’ peak monthly demand charge over a very short interval, typically only 15 minutes, a brief service outage for a system comprised of a single unit can create a high demand charge, and therefore be highly detrimental to the monthly savings of the system. For multiple unit sites, the likelihood of a full system outage that would result in a high demand charge is dramatically reduced, consequently, these customers have a greater probability of capturing peak demand savings. 
TECOGEN INC.

Our products are sold directly to customers by our in-house marketing team, and by established sales agents and representatives.
Our operations are comprised of three business segments. Our Products segment designs, manufactures and sells industrial and commercial cogeneration systems as described above. Our Services segment provides O&M services for our products under long term service contracts. Our Energy Production segment sells energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water and cooling to our customers under long-term sales agreements.
Ultera Low-Emissions Technology
All of our CHP products are available with the patented Ultera® low-emissions technology as an equipment option. This breakthrough technology was developed in 2009 and 2010 as part of a research effort partially funded by the California Energy Commission and Southern California Gas Company.
The chart below compares emission levels of our Ultera technology to other technologies. As of December 31, 2021, our Ultera CHP and fuel cell technologies are the only technologies that we know of which comply with California's air quality standards for CO and NOx, represented in the chart by the colored horizontal lines, shown as the world's strictest air quality standards on the lower right of the chart. We believe that as environmental regulation becomes more stringent in the United States, our emissions technology may be used in markets including generators, fork trucks and biogas engines.

TECOGEN INC.

After successfully developing the Ultera technology for our own equipment, our research and development team began exploring other possible emissions control applications in an effort to expand the market for the ultra-clean emissions system. Retrofit kits were developed in 2014 for other stationary engines and in 2015 the Ultera Retrofit Kit was applied successfully to natural gas stand-by generators from other manufacturers, including Generac and Caterpillar. 
Historically, standby generators have not been subjected to the strict air quality emissions standards of traditional power generation. However, generators which run for more than 200 hours per year or run for non-emergency purposes (other than routine scheduled maintenance) in some territories are subject to compliance with the same stringent regulations applied to a typical electric utility. As demand response programs become more economically attractive and air quality regulations continue to become more stringent, there could be increased demand for retrofitting standby generators with our Ultera® emissions control technology, thus providing a cost-effective solution to keeping the installed base of standby generators operational and in compliance with regulatory requirements. 
In 2017, a group of generators owned by a single customer in Southern California were supplied Ultera kits because of their particular requirement to exceed the 200-hour annual limit. These units are now operational and have been tested by the customer and shown to be compliant with the local pollution limits which we believe to be the strictest anywhere in the United States, and potentially the world. Our CHP products have been permitted to this same standard. However, CHP products are given a heat credit which effectively increases the allowable limit. In 2018, permitting was completed making these certification levels the lowest we have achieved. We believe no other engines have been certified to these levels since the current regulations in the Los Angeles region became effective. 
It is noteworthy that these engine-generators have been used in California to power dispersed loads in a fire-prone area where frequent de-energizing of the electric overhead power lines is required for safety. We believe this application to be a new and significant application for the Ultera technology in light of the widely publicized widespread outages in California in 2019 and 2020.
Biogas
The Ultera emissions control technology developed by our engineering team applies specifically to rich-burn, spark-ignited, internal combustion engines. While originally intended for natural gas-powered engines, we believe that our technology may be adapted for other fuel types as long as the engine meets the rich-burn criteria.
In 2015, the Ultera system was applied to a biogas powered engine operating at the Eastern Municipal Water District’s (EMWD) Moreno Valley Region Water Reclamation Facility in Perris, California. The demonstration project was a result of an ongoing collaboration between Tecogen, the EMWD and various other partners, and successfully applied an Ultera Retrofit Kit to a 50-liter Caterpillar engine fueled by biogas extracted from an anaerobic digester.
Biogas is a significant byproduct of wastewater treatment plants. Considered to be a renewable source of fuel, it is becoming an increasingly important resource for power generation. According to the American Biogas Council, nationwide there are over 1,100 engines fueled by wastewater-derived biogas, over 600 fueled by landfill-generated biogas, and over 100 running on biogas from agricultural waste. This represents a significant potential market for the Ultera Retrofit Kit application as these biogas engines become subject to the same air quality standards as traditional power generation sources.
Fork-Truck Research
In October 2016, we were awarded a Propane Education & Research Council (“PERC”) research grant funding our proposal to develop the Ultera ultra-clean emissions control technology for the propane powered fork truck market.
Electric fork trucks have been making significant in-roads in the fork truck industry, in part, because of their green image and indoor air quality benefit. The primary benefit of the Ultera-equipped ultra-clean propane fork truck will be fuel cell like emissions with a robust indoor air quality advantage without compromising vehicle performance. In 2018, the PERC funded portion of the project concluded successfully. Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift America (“MCFA”), a major supplier in North and South America, provided technical and marketing support and supplied a test truck. In 2019, engineers from MCFA collaborated with our research staff to finalize the engine tuning for optimization of the Ultera process. This work successfully demonstrated highly improved emissions levels for the fork truck.
Services
We provide long-term maintenance contracts, parts sales, and turnkey installation for our products through a network of eleven well-established field service centers in California, the Midwest, the Northeast, the Southeast and in Ontario, Canada. These centers are staffed by our full-time technicians, working from local leased facilities. The facilities provide office and warehouse space for inventory. We encourage our customers to provide internet connections to our units so that we may 
TECOGEN INC.

maintain remote monitoring and communications with the installed equipment. For connected installations, the machines are contacted daily to download their status and provide regular operational reports (daily, monthly, and quarterly) to our service managers. This communications link is used to support the diagnostic efforts of our service staff, and to send messages to pre-programmed phones if a unit has experienced an unscheduled shutdown. In many cases, communications received by service technicians from connected devices allow for proactive maintenance, minimizing equipment downtime and improving operating efficiency for the customer.
The work of our service managers, supervisors, and technicians focuses on our products. Because we manufacture our own equipment, our service technicians bring hands-on experience and competence to their jobs. They are trained at our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Most of our service revenue is in the form of annual service contracts, which are typically of an all-inclusive “bumper-to-bumper” type, with billing amounts proportional to the equipment's achieved operating hours for the period. Customers are thus invoiced in level, predictable amounts without unforeseen add-ons for such items as unscheduled repairs or engine replacements. We strive to maintain these contracts for many years, and work to maintain the integrity and performance of our equipment.
Our products have a long history of reliable operation. Since 1995, we have had a remote monitoring system in place that connects to hundreds of units daily and reports their “availability,” which is the amount of time a unit is running or is ready to run. More than 80% of the units operate above 90% availability, with the average being 93.8%. Our factory service agreements have directly impacted these positive results and represent an important long-term annuity-like stream of revenue for us.
New equipment sold beginning in 2016 and select upgrades to the existing installed equipment fleet include an industrial internet solution which enables Tecogen to collect, analyze, and manage valuable asset data continuously and in real-time. This provides the service team with improved insight into the functionality of our installed CHP fleet. Specifically, it enables the service department to perform remote monitoring and diagnostics and to view system results in real time via a computer, smart phone or tablet. Consequently, we can better utilize monitoring data ensuring customers are capturing maximum possible savings and efficiencies from their cogeneration equipment. 
Energy Production 
Our Energy Production segment sells energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water and cooling to our customers under long-term sales agreements which represented 7.1% and 6.5% our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 17 "Segments" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        
Sales & Distribution
Our products are sold directly to end-users by our sales team and by established sales agents and representatives. We have agreements with manufacturer's representatives and outside sales representatives who are compensated by commissions for designated territories and product lines. During the year ended December 31, 2021 no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020 one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. We typically sell our chiller products through our manufacturing representatives with assistance from our internal sales team. Our combined heat and power products are typically sold direct to end customers by our internal sales team. 
Markets and Customers
Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities (traditional electric utility providers) to back-up generators as small as 2 kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated central utility system utilizing high-temperature steam turbines powered by fossil-fuels. This turbine technology, though steadily refined over the years, reached a maximum efficiency (where efficiency means electrical energy output per unit of fuel energy input) of approximately 40% to 50%. 
A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technological advances have now broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers. Cogeneration, which harnesses waste energy from power generation processes and puts it to work for other uses on-site, can boost the energy conversion efficiency to nearly 90%, a better than two-fold improvement over the average efficiency of a fossil fuel plant. This distributed generation, or power generated on-site at the point of consumption rather than power generated centrally, eliminates the cost, complexity, and inefficiency associated with electric transmission and distribution. The implications of the CHP distributed generation approach are significant. We believe that if cogeneration were applied on a large scale, global fuel usage might be dramatically curtailed and the utility grid made far more resilient. Furthermore, with 
TECOGEN INC.

technology we have introduced, like the Ultera low-emissions technology, our products can now contribute to better air quality at the local level while complying with the strictest air quality regulations in the United States.
Our products can often reduce the customer’s operating costs (for the portion of the facility loads to which they are applied) by approximately 30% to 60% based on our estimates, which provides an excellent rate of return on the equipment’s capital cost in many areas of the country with high electricity rates. Our chillers are especially suited to regions where utilities impose extra charges during times of peak usage, commonly called “demand” charges. In these cases, the gas-fueled chiller reduces the use of electricity during the summer, the costliest time of year.
Decentralizing power generation or reducing energy requirements at a customer's site not only relieves the capacity burden on existing power plants, but also lessens the burden on transmission and distribution lines. This ultimately improves the grid’s reliability and reduces the need for costly upgrades.
Increasingly favorable economic conditions may improve our business prospects domestically and abroad. Specifically, we believe that natural gas prices are expected to increase from their current values, and that electric rates are expected to continue to rise more significantly over the long-term as utilities pay for grid expansion, better emission controls, efficiency improvements, and the integration of renewable power sources.
Most potential new customers in the U.S. require less than 1 MW of electric power and less than 1,200 tons of cooling capacity. We are targeting customers in states with high electricity rates in the commercial sector, such as California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York. Most of these states also have high peak demand rates, which favor utilization of our modular units in groups so as to assure redundancy and peak demand savings. Governmental agencies in some of these regions may also provide generous rebates that can improve the economic viability of our systems. 
We aggressively market to potential customers where utility pricing aligns with our advantages. These areas include regions that have strict emissions regulations, such as California, or those that reward CHP systems that are especially non-polluting, such as New Jersey. Currently, more than 23 states recognize CHP as part of their Renewable Portfolio Standards or Energy Efficiency Resource Standards.
The traditional markets for CHP systems are buildings with long hours of operation and with corresponding demand for electricity or cooling and heat. Traditional customers for our cogeneration systems include controlled environment agriculture, hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, universities, health clubs, spas, hotels, motels, office and retail buildings, food and beverage processors, multi-unit residential buildings, laundries, ice rinks, swimming pools, factories, municipal buildings, and military installations.
Traditional customers for our chillers, refrigeration compressors and heat pumps overlap with those for our cogeneration systems. Engine-driven chillers are often used as replacements for aging electric chillers because they both occupy similar amounts of floor space and require similar maintenance schedules. This is also the case with refrigeration compressors. 
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive, though we believe that we offer customers a suite of premier best-in-class clean energy and thermal solutions. 
InVerde and Tecopower
Our combined heat and power products that produce electricity and hot water compete with the utility grid, existing technologies such as other reciprocating engine and microturbine CHP systems, and other emerging distributed generation technologies including solar power, wind-powered systems, and fuel cells. Our products are highly competitive between 60KW and 1.5MW in electrical generation capacity. In this size range we have other reciprocating engine competitors, although we have strong competitive advantages when it comes to ease of utility interconnection and our microgrid capabilities. We believe that Capstone Turbine Corporation is the only microturbine manufacturer with a commercial presence in CHP. 
Although operating solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions, the main drawbacks to these renewable powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, their reliance on backup utility grid-provided power, and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies. Similarly, while the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of fuel cell companies are focused on markets similar to ours. Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as CHP systems in many territories. We believe that, notwithstanding these higher government incentives, our CHP solutions provide a better value and more robust solution to end users in most applications.
TECOGEN INC.

Additionally, our patents relating to the Ultera ultra-low emissions technology give our products a strong competitive advantage in markets where severe emissions limits are imposed or where very clean power is favored, such as New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts.
Overall, we compete with end users’ other options for electrical power, heating, and cooling on the basis of our technology’s ability to:
•Provide a more efficient solution that provides operational savings for a facility's energy needs including cooling, electricity and hot water;
•Provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service;
•Reduce emissions of criteria pollutants (NOx and CO) to near-zero levels and cut the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide due to increased efficiencies compared to the electric grid;
•Provide reliable on-site power generation, heating and cooling services; and
We believe that no other company has developed a product that provides the features and benefits provided by our inverter-based InVerde e+, which offers UL-certified grid connection and sophisticated off-grid and microgrid capabilities. An inverter-based product with at least some of these features has been introduced by others, but we believe that they face serious challenges in duplicating all the unique features of the InVerde e+. Competitors' product development time and costs could be significant. We have exclusive license rights to Microgrid algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin researchers. We have exclusive rights for engine-driven systems utilizing natural gas or diesel fuel in the application of power generation where the per-unit output is less than 500kW. The software allows our products to be integrated as a Microgrid, where multiple InVerde e+® units can be seamlessly isolated from the main utility grid in the event of an outage and re-connected to it afterward. We expect that our patents and license for Microgrid software will deter others from offering certain important functions. See "Business-Intellectual Property."
Similarly, in the growing Microgrid segment, neither fuel cells nor microturbines can respond to changing energy loads when the system is disconnected from the utility grid. Engines such as those used in our equipment inherently have a fast-dynamic response to step load changes, which is why they are the primary choice for emergency generators. Fuel cells and microturbines require additional energy storage systems to be utilized for time-limited off-grid operation, giving our engine-driven solutions an advantage for Microgrid and resiliency applications. 
Tecochill Chillers
Our Tecochill line of chillers are the only gas-engine-driven chillers available on the market. Natural gas can also fuel absorption chillers, which use fluids to transfer heat without an engine drive. However, engine driven chillers continue to have an efficiency advantage over absorption machines. Tecochill chillers reach efficiencies well above levels achieved by similarly sized absorption systems. Low natural gas prices in the United States improve the economics of natural gas-fueled chillers while their minimal electric demand on backup power systems make them ideal for facilities requiring critical precision climate control. In 2022 we plan to expand our Tecochill range of products to include a hybrid air cooled chiller based on the inverter design used in the InVerde. The hybrid air-cooled chiller will take simultaneous inputs from the electrical grid and the natural gas engine so that it can operate with the lowest cost and/or greenhouse gas footprint at any time based on changing conditions. 
Ilios Heat Pump
A few companies manufacture gas-engine heat pumps, including Yanmar and Tedom that we believe are competitive with our products. The Ilios® water heater and other heat pump products compete in both the high-efficiency water heating market and the CHP market. 
Research & Development 
Our long and rich research and development tradition and sustained programs have allowed us to cultivate deep engineering expertise. We have strong core technical knowledge that is critical to product support and continuous product improvement efforts. Our TecoDrive engine, permanent magnet generator, cogeneration and chiller products, InVerde, Ilios heat pumps, and most recently the Ultera emissions control system were all created and optimized in-house with both public and private funding support.
We continue to seek alliances with utilities, government agencies, universities, research facilities, and manufacturers. We have succeeded in developing new technologies and products in collaboration with several entities, including:
•Sacramento Municipal Utility District has provided test sites to us since 2010.
•Southern California Gas Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company, each a Sempra Energy subsidiary, have granted us research and development contracts since 2004.

We also continue to leverage our resources with government and industry funding, which has yielded a number of successful developments, including the Ultera low-emissions technology, sponsored by the California Energy Commission and Southern California Gas Company. Pursuant to the terms of the grants from the California Energy Commission, the California Energy Commission has a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive license to these technologies for government purposes. 
Our current internal R&D efforts are focused on the hybrid air cooled chiller that utilizes the basic inverter design used in the InVerde e+. Management believes that this chiller will address a significant market segment that is currently unaddressed by our existing Tecochill product. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we spent $542,079 and $767,323, respectively, on research and development activities.
Intellectual Property
Currently, we hold twelve United States patents for our technologies:
•10,774,720: “NOx Reduction Using a Dual-Stage Catalyst System with Intercooling in Vehicle Gasoline Engines under Real Driving Condition.” This patent, granted in September 2020, improves the removal of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) from vehicle emissions. The improved performance, consisting of up to 90% reductions in NMOG and CO results from increased oxidation of NMOG and CO due to a lower temperature environment in the second stage catalyst.
•10,774,724, titled, “Dual Stage Internal Combustion Engine Aftertreatment System Using Exhaust Gas Intercooling and Charger Driven Air Ejector.” This patent, granted in September 2020, relates to the use of turbo compressors and exhaust gas intercoolers in turbocharged engines to reduce the complexity and cost of Ultera emissions reduction systems. 
•9,995,195: “Emissions control systems and methods for vehicles.” This patent, granted in June 2018, is a method for vehicle cold start to enhance the removal of CO and hydrocarbons emissions, which are extremely problematic for cold engines. Air is injected in the exhaust between the engine’s close-coupled catalyst and underbody catalyst. Once the engine is warmed (> 500 F exhaust) this air stream is shut off. This method

•9,651,534: "Assembly and Method for reducing nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon gas in exhausts of internal combustion engines and producing and electrical output." This patent granted in April 25, 2017, is related to the Ultera emission control system applicable to all our products.
•8,578,704: “Assembly and method for reducing nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons in exhausts of internal combustion engines.” This patent, granted in November 2013, is for the Ultera emission control system applicable to all our products.
•7,243,017: “Method for controlling internal combustion engine emissions.” This patent, granted in July 2007, applies to the specific algorithms used in our engine controller for metering fuel usage to obtain the correct combustion mixture and is technology used by most of our engines. 
•7,239,034: “Engine driven power inverter system with cogeneration.” This patent, granted in July 2007, pertains to the utilization of an engine-driven CHP module combined with an inverter and applies to our InVerde product specifically.
Our patents expire between 2022 and 2037.
In addition, we have licensed specific rights to Microgrid software algorithms developed by University of Wisconsin researchers for which we pay royalties to the assignee, The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). The specific patent named in our agreement is “Control of small distributed energy resources” (7,116,010), granted in 2006. Our exclusive rights are for engine-driven systems utilizing natural gas or diesel fuel in the application of power generation where the per-unit output is less than 500 kW. The software allows our products to be integrated as a Microgrid, where multiple InVerde units can be seamlessly isolated from the main utility grid in the event of an outage and re-connected to it afterward. The licensed software allows us to implement such a Microgrid with minimal control devices and associated complexity and cost. We pay WARF a royalty for each cogeneration module sold using the licensed technology. Such royalty payments have been in the range of $5,000 to $13,000 on an annual basis through the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, WARF reserved the right to grant non-profit research institutions and governmental agencies non-exclusive licenses to practice and use, for non-commercial research purposes, the technology developed by us that is based on the licensed software.
We consider our patents and licensed intellectual property to be important in the operation of our business. The expiration, termination, or invalidity of one or more of these patents may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
One other company has developed a product that seeks to compete with our inverter-based InVerde, although it does not offer all of the same benefits and features offered by our InVerde products. We anticipate that an inverter-based product with at least some of the features offered by our InVerde products will be introduced by others, but we believe that our competitors will face serious challenges in duplicating the InVerde. Product development time and costs would likely be significant, and we expect that our patent for the inverter-based CHP system (7,239,034) provides significant protections for key features. We consider the Microgrid software algorithm licensed from WARF to be a key feature of our InVerde product, and one that would be difficult to duplicate outside the patent.
TECOGEN INC.

In 2013, we purchased rights to designs and technologies, including patents granted or pending for our permanent magnet generators. A key component of our InVerde module uses this acquired technology.
Our patents for the Ultera low-emissions control technology applies to all our gas engine-driven products and may have applications to other rich-burn spark-ignited internal combustion engines. We have been granted patents for this technology in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Korea and Singapore.
Copyrights
Our control software is protected by copyright laws or through an exclusive license agreement. 
Trademarks
We have registered the brand names of our equipment and logos used on our equipment. These registered trademarks include Tecogen, Tecochill, Tecopower, Ultera, InVerde, Ilios, InVerde e+ and the associated logos. We will continue to trademark our product names and symbols. 
We rely on treatment of our technology as trade secrets through confidentiality agreements, which our employees and vendors are required to sign. Also, we rely on non-disclosure agreements with others that have or may have access to confidential information to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. 
Sourcing & Manufacturing
We are focused on continuously strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies. Many of the components used in the manufacture of our highly-efficient clean energy equipment are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or are standard available parts sourced from multiple suppliers. We believe that adequate supplies exist to meet our near to medium term manufacturing needs. We have an on-going focus on developing and implementing new systems to simplify our manufacturing processes, product sourcing methods, and our supply chain. 
We have a combined total of approximately 27,000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space running on a single 5-day per week shift at our Waltham, Massachusetts facility. We believe we have sufficient spare capacity to meet near to medium term demand without incurring additional fixed costs although our Waltham lease expires March 31, 2024 and we will need to identify and move to alternate space prior to expiration of the Waltham lease.
Government & Regulation
Several kinds of federal, state and local government regulations affect our products and services, including but not exclusive to:
•product safety certifications and interconnection requirements;
•air pollution regulations which govern the emissions allowed in engine exhaust;
•state and federal incentives for CHP technology; 
•various local building and permitting codes and third-party certifications;
•electric utility pricing and related regulations; and
•federal and state laws regarding the legalization of cannabis for medicinal and recreational use.
Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are impacted not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our products with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation to reduce the electricity they take from the utility and to preserve electric capacity available from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems. This could make our systems less desirable, adversely impacting our revenue and profitability. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive, causing a material adverse effect on our operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
Similarly, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel

efficiency standards. We encourage investors and potential investors to carefully consider the risks described under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" below regarding various aspects of the regulatory environment and other related risks.
Our products are well-suited to meet the needs of the rapidly emerging indoor agriculture market, including cannabis. To date our focus in the indoor agricultural market has primarily involved cannabis, a product with high revenue generating potential. However, we have sold to other indoor agricultural growers, and we believe that the indoor food production market will provide significant opportunities for us. The indoor agriculture market in particular has the potential to be a major driver of growth as states move to legalize the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and recreational use. However, under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I drug, so that cannabis growers continue to face significant uncertainty regarding their ability to conduct business.
First passed by Congress in 2014, the Rohrabcher-Farr Amendment is an amendment to the annual appropriations bill that, among other things, funds the Department of Justice. It prohibits the US Attorney General from using funds to prosecute the medical use of cannabis. It does not address recreational use. On January 4, 2018, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole memo. Written in 2013, the Cole memo had directed US Attorneys not to allocate resources to prosecute "individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws" regarding the cannabis market. As of the date of the filing of this report, we are not aware of any US Attorney who has taken action against participants in the recreational cannabis market operating in accordance with state law. The uncertainty we face regarding the potential for growth from the sales to the cannabis industry is due in part to uncertainty regarding prosecutorial priorities of the current Presidential administration.
Our Energy Production segment is subject to extensive government regulation. We are required to file for local construction permits (electrical, mechanical and the like) and utility interconnects, and are required to make various local and state filings related to environmental emissions. 
In the past, many electric utility companies have raised opposition to distributed generation of energy, a critical element of our business model. Such resistance has generally taken the form of stringent standards for interconnection and the use of target rate structures as disincentives to combined generation of on-site power and heating or cooling services. A distributed generation facility's ability to obtain reliable and affordable back-up power through interconnection with the grid is essential to our business model. Utility policies and regulations in most states often do not accommodate widespread on-site generation. Barriers erected by electric utility companies and unfavorable regulations, where applicable, make our ability to connect to the electric grid at customer sites more difficult or uneconomic and is an impediment to the growth of our business. The development of our business could be adversely affected by any slowdown or reversal in the utility deregulation process or by difficulties in negotiating back-up power supply agreements with electric providers in the areas where we seek to do business. 
Environmental Matters
We are regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and service operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, the necessary research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.
On occasion, we may be engaged in remedial activities at a location, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable, we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material. 
Human Capital Resources
We believe our success in delivering energy efficient, ultra clean cogeneration systems, chillers and energy production services relies on our culture, values, and the creativity and commitment of our people. We strive to maintain healthy, safe, and secure working conditions and a workplace where our employees are treated with respect and dignity. Our vision is to create an inclusive, diverse and authentic community that inspires collaboration, integrity, engagement, and innovation. We are striving to create a world-class employee experience – one that offers opportunity for personal and professional growth, and enables work-life balance that aligns with our core values.
Employee Health and Safety
Employee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business. We have taken a common-sense approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business. Training, risk assessment, safety coaching, and 
TECOGEN INC.

employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility and employee safety. As resources are available, we expect to continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows. 2021 was unique due to the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on organizations, including ours. Our response has consistently evolved to meet the turbulent environment:
• The senior management team implemented regular communication regarding impacts of the
 COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures. 
•    Implementing a hierarchy of controls to address hand washing, social distancing, cleaning areas and frequency, personal protective equipment and resources to stay up to date on the changing conditions.
•    Deployment of face covers across the company for use in areas where they are required and recommended.
•    Limiting domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees.
•    Providing additional days of leave for full- and part-time employees to cope with the illness.
•    Restricting access to our corporate offices.
•    Providing public access by appointment or pickup only in high risk areas.
•    Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure.
•    Working closely with customers to meet their specific COVID-19 requirements and maintain service.
We understand the benefits of employee health and safety and continue to invest in programs, products, and resources. We also understand the environment of trust and fairness that exists when information is openly shared. We also continue to invest in products and services to meet the health and safety needs of our customers and communities.
Talent Acquisition and Development
Our values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership. The ultimate goal is straightforward: find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. Reasons include fair compensation, a complete array of employee benefits to include: health, dental and life insurance; short-term and long-term disability insurance; HSA account funding; generous time off benefits; and the grant of options or awards to purchase shares of our common stock. Recently we instituted web-based training for all of our employees. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 77 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, including 7 sales and marketing personnel, 46 service personnel, 19 manufacturing personnel and 7 finance and administrative personnel. Nine of our New Jersey service employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement which expires on December 31, 2022 and thereafter renews annually unless terminated by either party by written notice within sixty days prior to the expiration date.
