Item 1. | Business

Merger Agreement with Tesla
On February 3, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Maxwell, Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tesla”) and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (“Merger Sub”), which contemplates the acquisition of Maxwell by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement contemplates that Tesla will commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Maxwell (the “Offer”), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into Maxwell pursuant to which Maxwell will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the “Merger”).
In the Offer, each Maxwell stockholder who elects to participate in the Offer will receive a fractional share of common stock of Tesla, $0.001 par value (“Tesla Common Stock”) for each share of Maxwell common stock, par value $0.10 (“Maxwell Common Stock”) exchanged in the Offer. Tesla, through Merger Sub, will commence the Offer to purchase each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell Common Stock for a fraction of a share of Tesla Common Stock, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the volume weighted average closing sale price of one (1) share of Tesla Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day immediately preceding the expiration of the Offer (the “Tesla Trading Price”). However, in the event that the Tesla Trading Price is equal to or less than $245.90, then each share of Maxwell Common Stock shall be exchanged for 0.0193 of a share of Tesla Common Stock. Such shares of Tesla Common Stock, plus any cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Tesla Common Stock, is referred to as the “Offer Consideration”.
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each outstanding option to purchase Maxwell Common Stock that is outstanding, unexercised and unexpired immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Maxwell Option”) shall be automatically assumed by Tesla and converted into and become an option to acquire Tesla Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Maxwell Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to an adjustment for the number of shares and the exercise price pursuant to which such Maxwell Option will be converted into Tesla Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each Maxwell restricted share unit (“Maxwell RSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Tesla and converted automatically into and become a restricted stock unit covering shares of Tesla Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Maxwell RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to an adjustment for the number of shares in which the RSU will be converted into Tesla Common Stock.
The Board of Directors of Maxwell (the “Board”) has unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement, and the Board has resolved to recommend to the stockholders of Maxwell to accept the Offer and tender their shares of Maxwell Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub’s obligation to accept and pay for shares of Maxwell Common Stock that are tendered in the Offer is subject to customary conditions. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of Tesla, Merger Sub and Maxwell that are customary for a transaction of this nature. The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the absence of certain legal impediments, the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under applicable anti-trust laws, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering the Tesla Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, and a minimum condition that at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of Maxwell Common Stock outstanding immediately after the consummation of the Offer are tendered in the Offer. Each of the parties may also terminate the Merger Agreement if the closing of the Offer has not occurred within five (5) months of the signing of the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition.
We have prepared this Form 10-K and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K as if we were going to remain an independent company. If the Offer and Merger are consummated, many of the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K will no longer be applicable.
Overview
Maxwell was incorporated under the name Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. in 1965. The Company made an initial public offering of common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1983, and changed its name to Maxwell Technologies, Inc. in 1996. We are headquartered in San Diego, California, and have design, sales and manufacturing locations in the United States, Germany, China and South Korea. We develop, manufacture and market energy storage and power delivery products for transportation, grid energy storage, industrial and other applications. We are focused on enhancing our technology platforms to achieve sustainable growth in the Automotive, Grid, Rail and Wind markets within Energy Storage, and further advance our Dry Battery Electrode technology to capitalize on what we believe represents an unprecedented long-term growth opportunity.

• | Energy Storage: Our market leading ultracapacitor products are energy storage devices that possess a unique combination of high power density, extremely long operational life and the ability to charge and discharge very rapidly. Our ultracapacitor cells, multi-cell packs, modules and subsystems provide highly reliable energy storage and power delivery solutions for applications in multiple industries, including automotive, grid energy storage, wind, bus, industrial and truck. Our lithium-ion capacitors are energy storage devices with the power characteristics of an ultracapacitor combined with the enhanced energy storage capacity approaching that of a battery and are uniquely designed to address a variety of applications in the rail, grid, and industrial markets where energy density and weight are differentiating factors.


• | Dry Battery Electrode Technology: We have developed and transformed our patented, proprietary and fundamental dry electrode manufacturing technology that we have historically used to make ultracapacitors to create a breakthrough technology that can be applied to the manufacturing of batteries. Using this technology, we believe we can create significant performance and cost benefits as compared to today’s state of the art lithium-ion batteries. Our dry battery electrode technology has the potential to be a groundbreaking technology within the battery industry with a substantial market opportunity, particularly for use in electric vehicles.

During the period covered by this Annual Report, we also owned and operated a high voltage product line via our former Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell Technologies, SA (“Maxwell SA”). High voltage’s CONDIS® capacitor products include grading and coupling capacitors, electric voltage transformers and metering products that are used to ensure the safety and reliability of electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport, distribution and measurement of high-voltage electrical energy. On December 19, 2018, we sold Maxwell SA to RN C Holding SA, a special purpose holding entity and affiliate of Renaissance Investment Foundation, as part of the Company’s strategy. This transaction was intended to enhance our balance sheet and provide additional financial resources to further expedite investments in our core technologies across both energy storage and dry battery electrode technology platforms as well as to enhance our ability to support our customers and the various projects underway and planned. Except as specifically indicated, the description of the Company and our assets and operations excludes the high voltage product line. The high voltage product line has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of operations of the high voltage product line for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been excluded from the our continuing operating results.
Industry Trends
There are three fast approaching, disruptive megatrends which we believe will drive and create unique long-term growth opportunities in our industry. These megatrends include electrification of combustion engine vehicles, the revolution of battery electric vehicles and renewable power generation in the grid.

• | First, as the use of premium features such as e-active suspension, autonomous driving and other power demanding applications continue to penetrate the automotive market, high power and rapid response energy storage and power delivery solutions are increasingly required to address the new technological challenges that these advanced features will create.


• | Second, as global emission policies continue to tighten and the cost for lithium-ion batteries continues to fall, the automotive industry is on the verge of an electric vehicle revolution, which we believe will fundamentally change the industry and how automobiles are made and used. Advanced lithium-ion battery performance and reduced costs are at the center of this fundamental change and we believe that innovation in this area could be a major factor in determining the winners and losers in the future of the highly competitive automotive industry.


• | Third, as costs for renewable power generation continue to decline and converge on those of traditional forms, renewable penetration on the grid is increasing at accelerated rates. This increasing penetration requires advanced energy storage and power delivery technologies for successful integration and to stabilize the grid as this modernization takes effect.

In recent years, we have also experienced a shift in customer demand from cells to sophisticated, complete subsystem solutions, which require increased intelligence and integration with existing networks, particularly in areas such as the automobile drive train and the energy grid. Therefore, in the year ended December 31, 2018, we streamlined operations, divested our high voltage product line and strengthened our balance sheet to transition Maxwell Technologies to a Pure-Play energy storage technology company.

Strategy
Our primary corporate objective is to offer innovative products to our customers to help them achieve their business goals. Further, our strategy is to drive continuous improvements across all facets of operations, enhance our research and development capabilities and diversify our business which we expect will lead to increased revenue, further positioning the Company for accelerated, profitable growth over the long-term to ultimately create sustainable value for our stockholders. Beginning in 2015, we undertook a series of initiatives with the goal of transforming the business to align with our strategy, including organizational restructuring to right size the business and put the cost structure in line with the magnitude of revenue, ramping up our innovation engine in order to provide leading-edge products at a faster rate to our customers and partners, and strengthening of the management team. Additionally, we sought to optimize our portfolio by divesting our Microelectronics product line in 2016, acquiring the core business and operating entities of Nesscap Energy, Inc. in 2017, and divesting our high voltage product line in December 2018. We also strengthened our balance sheet by raising a net $46 million in a convertible debt financing in 2017 and a net $23 million in a public stock offering in August 2018. As a result of these initiatives, we have been able to allocate additional resources to research and development to further build out our technology platform across both energy storage platforms and dry battery electrode technologies. We believe these markets represent the greatest potential for long-term success and that our existing technology and customer footprint provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Our strategy specifically focuses on optimizing and commercializing our two product portfolios:
Energy Storage
The second part of our strategy is to optimize our energy storage portfolio and technology platform to drive business diversification, achieve scale, and to transition our business to higher growth opportunities. The energy storage market is estimated to become a $1.35 billion market by 2023, and projected to grow at approximately 20% on a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”), according to a variety of sources, including Navigant Research, CNEAI production data, internal market research and direct customer feedback. Over the last year, we have made steady progress leveraging our core competencies and diversifying our ultracapacitor products to drive sustainable growth in automotive, grid energy storage, rail and wind. Our cumulative design wins in our target markets have more than tripled over the last three years. In 2017, we acquired the core business and operating entities of Nesscap Energy, Inc. in order to drive customer diversification, achieve scale and position the business to win high growth opportunities. We combined Nesscap’s best-in-class small cell product portfolio with Maxwell’s leadership in large cell solutions to create the most complete portfolio available in the market for our customers and we are leveraging the talent of our newly combined R&D teams and plan to launch several new products in 2019 to meet the needs of our customers. As we move into 2019, we believe that the progress we are making in energy storage has positioned us take advantage of the three megatrends in renewable power generation and vehicle electrification, all of which we expect will accelerate our design in momentum as well as advance our strategy to deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and stockholders. In 2018, we released several new intelligent, application specific, standard subsystem products, including 1) a multi-cell subsystem which combines Maxwell’s ultracapacitors with proprietary, advanced power conversion electronics to supply enhanced performance for a wide variety of demanding automotive applications; 2) two new highly scalable subsystem products to deliver reliable, fast responding, long lifetime storage in grids and microgrids; and 3) a wind pitch retrofit system where ultracapacitors are addressing the cost and battery replacement challenges faced by wind turbines already in operation.
We believe that our automotive business, which has historically contributed a modest, but consistent revenue stream, has the largest growth potential for our Company. As features that demand increased and reliable electrical power grow with the proliferation of hybrid electric vehicles and the advent of autonomous driving, the need for high power and rapid response energy storage and power delivery solutions is becoming increasingly important. Automakers are evaluating new electrification strategies to meet the future CO2 emission standards in vehicles while increasing the level of performance and features. Several of these new technologies will likely be adopted in mild-hybrid vehicles where an electric motor assists the combustion engine, allowing it to turn off for longer periods of time while the car is coasting, as well as during short accelerations or braking. However, there are times when additional power is required, such as when stepping on the gas pedal to accelerate the vehicle, and the combustion engine must be powered back on. In this case, we believe that ultracapacitors fit in particularly well to provide the short-term burst of power needed to turn the combustion engine on while, in parallel, the electric motor is fueling the other power needs of the vehicle. As vehicle electrification continues to accelerate, we continue to see increased interest from key OEMs, especially for our newer, complete subsystem solutions, and particularly for autonomous driving applications. We are encouraged by the continued ramp of eActive Suspension and Back-up and Peak Power applications.

In 2018, we announced a technology partnership with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group (Geely), the parent company of leading brands such as Volvo and Geely Auto, which focuses on the integration of state-of-the-art ultracapacitors and advanced power conversion electronics into Geely’s global automotive vehicle lineup in support of their fleet electrification strategy, beginning with the inclusion of Maxwell’s ultracapacitor-based peak power subsystem in five model year 2020 mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. These vehicles will initially be available in North America and Europe and the production ramp for these models is slated to begin in late 2019. With our game-changing Geely-Volvo solution, we have demonstrated the benefit that ultracapacitor solutions can provide to support the heightened demand of the growing electric functions in vehicles. Further, we have publicly stated that the Geely-Volvo alliance represents greater than a $100 million market opportunity. We have 14 other confirmed automotive design wins at various stages of progress and in several different applications including Start/Stop, eActive Suspension, eTurbo and Back-up Power for Autonomous Driving. We have also discussed several additional larger opportunities that could provide for considerable volume and drive material revenue growth in 2020 and beyond.
In the grid energy storage market, as costs for renewable power generation continue to fall and converge toward those of traditional forms, renewable penetration into the grid is increasing at accelerated rates. Efficient integration of renewable power sources into the existing grid requires advanced energy storage, stabilization, and power delivery technologies. We believe we are making excellent progress as we are experiencing increasing levels of engagement from customers and are moving rapidly from pilot projects to both large utility-scale as well as small to mid-scale commercial projects at the micro-grid level. In 2018, we launched two new grid products, an open cell pack and a subsystem design. These products are configurable from sub-1 megawatt to hundreds of megawatts, directly addressing existing and growing power quality issues facing the grid infrastructure by delivering fast responding power for applications including voltage support, frequency response and renewables power smoothing for utilities, power generators, and commercial and industrial customers across the globe. 
Also in 2018, we announced a subsystem design-in with Siemens Transmission Solutions to deliver economical, fast responding, long life grid voltage and frequency support solutions. Maxwell’s Grid Energy Storage Systems are an integral design element in the Siemens’ SVC PLUS FS that will provide system inertia in the form of fast, active power injection, which bridges the time gap between grid disruption and the activation of secondary power reserves for large utilities. These solutions are intended to stabilize global power grids. Maxwell’s ultracapacitors were selected as the energy storage asset of choice to provide grid frequency and voltage support due to their rapid response time at high power levels, long lifetime and minimal maintenance. 
Due to the high reliability and long life of ultracapacitors, our customers are also requesting these products as support systems to improve the performance and lifetime of batteries that are already installed in the grid. We have spent multiple years developing these products due to the complex nature and increased intelligence desired by our customers. Given the demands from the megatrend of renewables entry into the grid and our new product introductions, which directly address these demands, we have a growing number of project opportunities under development in the United States, Europe, and Australia for applications both in front of and behind the meter and expect to see gradual revenue ramp up in 2019, setting the stage for more meaningful growth in 2020.
We believe the rail market is also poised for future growth, driven by a significant light rail infrastructure build-out in China to support continued urbanization. We have partnered with China Railway Rolling Rock Corporation, or CRRC-SRI, in China to develop lithium-ion capacitor based light rail on-board systems. CRRC-SRI’s full-scale commercial manufacturing facility in China was readied for cell production in late 2018 and we expect production to being a gradual ramp up 2019 and then build thereafter. Maxwell is the exclusive supplier of electrode to CRRC-SRI, thus we expect our top-line revenue to grow proportionately with CRRC-SRI’s cell production ramp up. We are also investing in the advancement of our Generation 2 lithium-ion capacitor technology development and are on track to meet program milestones, including improvement in low temperature capability, lower resistance and increased energy density; we are anticipating we will be production-ready sometime in the third quarter of 2019. We expect that the grid and rail markets could become more significant contributors to our revenue growth in the coming years. Additionally, we are discussing additional development opportunities with our partner for Generation 3 technology, which we believe would further advance power and energy densities, lead to new applications and, ultimately, new revenue and growth opportunities.
The wind market in China continues to be a significant revenue contributor to Maxwell with growth opportunities coming from the ongoing development of offshore wind resources in China and the deployment of our new wind pitch retrofit systems for existing commercial wind farms in North America and Europe. Our retrofit modules are designed to replace existing battery-based emergency pitch control systems for reliable and fail-safe performance, and can considerably reduce the cost of ownership for operating wind energy. Deployment of retrofit modules into commercial wind farms began to ramp up in 2018 and we expect to continue to penetrate the 20,000 turbine opportunity in the U.S. as we grow the number of turbine installations and as we reach more wind farms throughout 2019 and beyond. Overall, we believe Maxwell is well positioned in the wind market and we anticipate the market to moderately grow in the future.

We are constantly working on improving technical performance of our products, such as higher temperature capability, higher voltage levels and higher power density as well as increasing reliability and ruggedness of our products for an extended application lifetime. We are increasing our focus on developing entire system solutions and supporting rapid product implementations in emerging markets and applications. We expect this could lead to higher gross margin opportunities. In order to develop new, innovative solutions and accelerate time-to-market for these solutions, we are focused on developing these capabilities ourselves and on establishing technical and commercial relationships with value-added partners within our target market segments and applications, including value-added distributors, solution level integrators, tier-one suppliers and automotive manufacturers.
Dry Battery Electrode Technology
Our strategy is focused on commercializing our dry battery electrode technology, which we believe is a unique and transformative battery technology that addresses a significantly larger market opportunity, particularly in electric vehicles. A significant megatrend is fast approaching in the automotive industry as emission policies and regulations enacted by global governments continue to tighten. To meet these requirements, electric vehicles are expected to become more heavily adopted, which necessitates that the cost of lithium-ion batteries must continue to fall as well as meet targeted performance requirements. The shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles is accelerating and is likely to fundamentally change the industry, including how automobiles are made and used. Lithium-ion batteries are attracting substantial investment as auto makers drive toward lower cost electric vehicles with longer range between charges. We believe that improved lithium-ion batteries are the key enabling technology for vehicle electrification, and as such, cost reduction and performance improvement have become critical targets for the world’s leading lithium-ion battery manufacturers and automotive OEMs. We believe that our dry battery electrode technology can successfully address the need to improve energy density, extend battery life and improve durability, lead to significant cost reductions and production capacity density increases and address customers’ demands for more environmentally-responsible solutions. Further, we believe that our patent-protected, proprietary manufacturing process, which has been utilized through many years of ultracapacitor production, can be applied to the manufacturing of battery electrode without the use of solvents to produce a highly reliable electrode material with uniform characteristics resulting in enhanced product performance, long-term durability, and lower manufacturing cost. 
By applying our proprietary dry manufacturing process and trade secrets to the production of lithium-ion batteries, we believe that we can create significant performance and cost benefits when compared to today’s state of the art technology. In 2016, we signed a joint development agreement with a leading global automotive OEM and a global tier one automotive supplier on a proof-of-concept basis to validate dry battery electrode performance on a pilot scale. We have completed this proof-of-concept, which we believe has demonstrated the significant performance and cost advantages of our dry electrode manufacturing process compared with wet electrode manufacturing, while providing the required consistency and reproducibility in manufacturing a pilot-scale dry electrode roll. Throughout 2018, following the proof-of-concept, we have continued to make additional technology advances. 
As the trend toward battery electric vehicles continues to increase, efforts are accelerating in the automotive and energy storage industries to prepare for this coming demand. We believe that our dry battery electrode technology could be a central enabling technology for the battery electric vehicle market. We have experienced increasing interest from additional large, brand name, global players in the energy storage and automotive industries regarding future joint development and commercialization efforts and we are currently in deep discussions with potential partners regarding broader collaborations, with the ultimate goal of commercialization, which we believe could unlock significant value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Given the recent successes in the proof-of-concept, the additional technology advancements and the increasing interest from global leaders from automotive and energy storage markets, we have begun to shift more investment towards the development of dry battery electrode technology. Moreover, in 2019 we intend to begin building a state-of-the art pilot-scale manufacturing facility to further prove the benefits and manufacturability of this technology. In addition, we are highly focused on attaining broader, scale-up agreements with our current and prospective partners that could accelerate the commercialization of this breakthrough technology.

General Product Line and Technology Overview
Dry Battery Electrode Technology
Our dry battery electrode technology leverages our core dry electrode process technology currently used to manufacture ultracapacitors. This unique electrode manufacturing process expands our core technology into batteries of varying chemistry with value-added performance features over wet-coated electrode technology at a reduced production cost. The performance differentiators afforded by dry coating technology are higher energy density, longer operating lifetime, high temperature operating robustness and higher charge/discharge rate capability. As a solvent-less process technology, dry electrode manufacturing is less costly and much more environmentally friendly. We believe that the investment in manufacturing equipment for dry processing is significantly less than wet coating technology, with much lower energy consumption as there is no need to use, remove and recapture solvent from electrode during fabrication. In addition to offering benefits over today’s battery chemistries, dry process technology enables electrode production using high energy density, liquid sensitive materials that are more encumbered by wet coating processes. 
Energy Storage
Our energy storage products consist primarily of ultracapacitors. Ultracapacitors enhance the efficiency and reliability of devices or systems that generate or consume electrical energy. They differ from other energy storage and power delivery products by combining rapid charge/discharge capabilities typically associated with film and electrolytic capacitors with energy storage capacity generally associated with batteries. Although batteries store significantly more electrochemical energy than ultracapacitors, they cannot charge and discharge as rapidly and efficiently as ultracapacitors. Conversely, although electrolytic capacitors can deliver bursts of high power very rapidly, they have limited energy storage capacity, and therefore cannot sustain power delivery as long as ultracapacitors. Also, unlike batteries, which store energy by means of a chemical reaction and experience gradual depletion of their energy storage and power delivery capability over hundreds to a few thousand charge/discharge cycles, ultracapacitors’ energy storage and power delivery mechanisms involve minimal chemical reactions, so they can be charged and discharged hundreds of thousands to millions of times in typical operating environments with negligible performance degradation. This ability to store energy, deliver bursts of power and perform reliably for many years, with little or no maintenance, makes ultracapacitors an attractive and efficient energy storage option for a wide range of energy-consuming and generating devices and applications.
The core of our technology for the majority of our ultracapacitor products is a proprietary, solvent-free or dry, electrode manufacturing process. This high throughput roll-to-roll process produces high-reliability electrode material with uniform thickness resulting in enhanced product performance and long-term durability. The process enables a favorable cost position versus competitors. As part of our offerings, we market our dry processed electrode material to other ultracapacitor manufacturers. We have licensed our proprietary cell architecture to manufacturers in China, Taiwan and Korea to expand and accelerate acceptance of ultracapacitor products in large and rapidly growing global markets. In addition to our dry electrode process technology, in 2017, we broadened our technology base and product portfolio through our acquisition of a Korea-based manufacturer specializing in small cell technology utilizing a wet electrode manufacturing process. 
Complementary to our ultracapacitor products, lithium-ion capacitors are energy storage devices, which due to their unique materials and design, have more than three times the energy density, similar power density, and a similarly long cycle life compared with ultracapacitors, as well as very low self-discharge similar to lithium-ion batteries. 
Products and Applications
Our products incorporate our know-how and proprietary energy storage and power delivery technologies at both the component and system levels for specialized, high-value applications that demand “life-of-the-application” reliability.

Dry Battery Electrode
The critical and performance governing components in a given battery are the electrodes. Battery devices are comprised of at least two electrodes, a negative electrode paired with a positive electrode, interposed by an ionically conductive film in between the electrochemical couple and filled with electrolyte in a sealed package. The incumbent wet electrode coating technology is limited by at least one of the following values: cost, electrode architecture, material platform and safety. Solvent used in wet coated electrode manufacturing imparts higher system cost, limits specific energy of the electrode due to thickness barrier, limits liquid sensitive battery material usage and is inherently toxic. As such, our dry battery electrode process technology, a solvent-free manufacturing method, is expected to deliver all the noted values since no solvent and/or liquid is required. Value-added benefits include reduction in system cost by simplifying electrode production, significantly reducing manufacturing facility requirements, enablement of broad-range material use, flexibility in electrode architecture for high specific energy design and accommodation of eco-friendly manufacturing. Our patent portfolio extends to certain of these technologies. Our dry electrode process technology can be used to produce batteries for consumer electronics, healthcare products, industrial goods, grid energy storage systems and automotive applications, which comprise an enormous market potential. In applications that demand high energy density and long runtime, our dry electrode is advantageously positioned as we can furnish electrode architectures that are unmatched by today’s product offering in an economical and socially responsible fashion. The dry electrode can be further applied to advanced battery chemistries, offering well over 300 Wh/kg at the cell level.
Energy Storage
Ultracapacitors, also known as electrochemical double-layer capacitors (“EDLC”) or supercapacitors, store energy electrostatically. Although ultracapacitors are electrochemical devices, minimal chemical reactions are involved in their energy storage mechanism. Their electrostatic energy storage mechanism is fully reversible, allowing ultracapacitors to be rapidly charged and discharged hundreds of thousands to millions of times with minimal performance degradation.
Compared with batteries, which require minutes or hours to fully charge or discharge, ultracapacitors discharge and recharge in as little as fractions of a second. Although ultracapacitors store only about five to ten percent as much electrical energy as a battery of comparable size, they can deliver or absorb electric energy up to 100 times more rapidly than batteries. Because they operate reliably through hundreds of thousands to millions of charge cycles, compared with only hundreds to a few thousand equivalent cycles for batteries, ultracapacitors have significantly higher lifetime energy throughput, which equates to significantly lower cost on a life cycle basis. Our ultracapacitor products have significant advantages over batteries, including:

• | the ability to charge and discharge up to 100 times faster;


• | significantly lower weight per unit of power delivery;


• | higher charge/discharge turnaround efficiency, minimizing energy loss;


• | the ability to operate reliably and continuously in extreme temperatures (-40º C to +65º C);


• | minimal to no maintenance requirements;


• | “life of the application” durability; and


• | minimal environmental issues associated with disposal because they contain no heavy metals.

With no moving parts and negligible chemical reactions involved in their energy storage mechanism, ultracapacitors provide a simple and highly reliable solution to buffer short-term mismatches between power available and power required. Additionally, ultracapacitors offer the advantage of storing energy in the same form in which it is used, as electricity.
Maxwell offers ultracapacitor cells with capacitances ranging from 1 to 3,400 farads. We link our ultracapacitor cells together in multi-cell modules and subsystems to satisfy energy storage and power delivery requirements of specific applications. Applications include peak power assistance and back-up power of mission critical functions in vehicles, stabilization of the grid with incremental use of solar and wind energy, and highly reliable, maintenance-free, energy storage for various types of industrial installations and heavy transportation.

In many applications, power demand varies widely from moment to moment, and peak power demand typically is much greater than the average power requirement. For example, automobiles require 10 times more power to accelerate than to maintain a constant speed, and forklifts require more power to lift a heavy pallet of material than to move from place to place within a warehouse. Engineers historically have addressed transient peak power requirements by over-sizing the engine, battery or other primary energy source to satisfy all of a system’s power demands, including demands that occur infrequently and may last only fractions of a second. Sizing a primary power source to meet brief peak power requirements, rather than for average power requirements, is costly and inefficient. When a primary energy source is coupled with ultracapacitors, which can deliver or absorb brief bursts of high power on demand for periods of time ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes, the primary energy source can be smaller, lighter and less expensive.
To facilitate the adoption of ultracapacitor subsystems, we have developed integration technologies, including proprietary hardware and software solutions supported by robust mechanical designs, with a dedicated team of employee experts who are capable of translating complex customer requirements into application specific standard products. We hold patents for certain of these technologies. Our subsystem products incorporate a range from 6 to 60 of our ultracapacitor cells to provide “plug and play” solutions for applications requiring from 12 to 160 volts, and can intelligently interface with a host controller to enhance the overall performance, reliability and safety of the system. 
Manufacturing
Our internal manufacturing operations are conducted in production facilities located in Peoria, Arizona; and Yongin, South Korea. We have made substantial capital investments to expand our internal production facilities and incorporate mechanization and automation techniques and processes. We have trained our manufacturing personnel in advanced operational techniques, added information technology infrastructure and implemented new business processes and systems to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency, planning and product quality. Our dry-processed ultracapacitor electrode material is currently produced exclusively at our Peoria facility and our wet-processed ultracapacitor electrode material is produced exclusively at our Korean facility. We outsource the assembly of our 60 mm diameter large cell ultracapacitors, and subsequently, assembly of large cell-based multi-cell modules as well as assembly of our mid-size D-cell ultracapacitor products and D-cell-based multi-cell modules to contract manufacturers based in China. Considering our plans to expand our manufacturing facility for certain product lines as further described below, we believe that we have sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand for all of our product lines.
Energy Storage
We produce our dry-processed electrode material for our own ultracapacitor products, and for sale to other ultracapacitor manufacturers such as Yeong-Long Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YEC”) at our Peoria facility. In 2013, we completed a major electrode capacity expansion in our Peoria facility. This facility gives us sufficient capacity to support both our current ultracapacitor production requirements and external electrode demand in the near term. As demand increases, additional increments of electrode production capacity can be added within a year through the utilization of established equipment vendors. Additionally, in our South Korea manufacturing facility, we produce wet-processed ultracapacitor electrode material and assemble this material into small and medium cell ultracapacitors; we made investments in 2018 to expand the capacity of this plant in order to meet projected demand for these products.
As noted above, we have outsourced assembly of all other cell types and multi-cell modules to contract manufacturers in China. 
To increase reliability, reduce cost, simplify assembly and facilitate automation, we have designed our ultracapacitor products to incorporate lower-cost materials and to reduce both the number of parts in a finished cell and the number of manufacturing process steps required to produce them. We intend to continue using outsourced cell and module assembly in countries with cost-efficient value-added services, but plan to continue to produce our proprietary electrode material only in internal production facilities to ensure the continued protection of our intellectual property.
Suppliers
We generally purchase components and materials, such as carbon powder, certain electronic components, dielectric materials, and ceramic insulators from a variety of suppliers. For certain products, we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier for a number of reasons, including notably, the cost-effectiveness of doing business with a single supplier. Although we believe there are alternative sources for some of the components and materials that we currently obtain from a single source, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify alternative suppliers in a timely and cost-effective manner. Therefore, for certain critical components, we utilize mitigation strategies such as, for example, maintaining an inventory of safety stock on site at our respective manufacturing locations in an effort to minimize the impact of an unforeseen disruption in supply from these outside parties.
10

Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our products worldwide through both direct and indirect sales channels for incorporation by integrators and OEM customers into a wide range of end products. Because the introduction of products based on emerging technologies requires customer acceptance of new and unfamiliar technical approaches, and because many OEM customers have rigorous vendor qualification processes, the design-in process and initial sale of our products often take months or even years.
Our principal marketing strategy is to identify applications for which our products and technology offer a compelling value proposition, to become a preferred vendor on the basis of service, value and price, and to negotiate supply agreements that enable us to establish long-term relationships with key OEM and integrator customers. To optimize our go-to-market strategy and tailor our products to end-user application, we organized our marketing team into two specialized ultracapacitor product line teams. One team supports Automotive and Transportation market segments which require highly rugged and robust products with very stringent automotive qualification requirements and solid change management. The other team supports all Green Infrastructure applications such as grid energy storage, wind power and other more stationary applications that require very cost sensitive products with very high service lifetimes and often very complex systems solutions. Our marketing efforts strive to develop application-specific product portfolios and solutions for our Automotive & Transportation and Green Infrastructure market segments. As these design-in sales tend to be technical and engineering-intensive, we organize market-specific teams composed of sales, applications engineering and other technical and operational personnel to work closely with our customers across multiple disciplines to satisfy their requirements for form, fit, function and environmental needs. As time-to-market often is a primary motivation for our customers to use our products, the initial sale and design-in process typically evolve into ongoing account management to ensure on-time delivery, responsive technical support and value-added problem-solving.
We design and conduct discrete marketing programs intended to position and promote each of our product lines. These include trade shows, seminars, advertising, product publicity, distribution of product literature, internet websites and social media. We utilize marketing communications specialists to develop and implement our marketing programs, design and develop marketing materials, negotiate advertising media purchases, write and place product press releases and manage our marketing websites.
We also have an alliance with YEC to assemble and market small cell ultracapacitor products. In addition, we sell electrode material to YEC, both for Maxwell-branded products and for incorporation into YEC’s own ultracapacitor products.
Competition
Each of our product lines has competitors, some of whom have longer operating histories. In some of the target markets for our emerging technologies, we face competition both from products utilizing well-established, existing technologies and other novel or emerging technologies.
Dry Battery Electrode
We have focused our efforts around applying dry battery electrode technology to the production of lithium-ion batteries, which we believe can create significant performance and cost benefits when compared to today’s state of the art lithium-ion batteries that are produced using wet process technology. Our dry battery electrode technology has two types of competitors: current producers of lithium-ion batteries that use wet process technology, which are the standard today in the electric vehicle market, and companies developing new, alternative technologies or processes that could gain broad market acceptance.

Energy Storage
Our ultracapacitor products have two types of competitors: other ultracapacitor suppliers and purveyors of energy storage and power delivery solutions based on batteries or other technologies. Although a number of companies are developing ultracapacitor products and technology, our principal competitors in the supply of ultracapacitor or supercapacitor products are Panasonic, a division of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., LS Mtron, a unit of LS Cable, Supreme Power Solutions Co., Ltd., Vina Technology Company, Ltd., Samxon, a unit of Man Yue Technology Holdings, Ltd., Skeleton Technologies, Yunasko, Ltd., and Ioxus, Inc. The key competitive factors in the ultracapacitor industry are price, performance (energy stored and power delivered per unit volume), durability and reliability, operational lifetime and overall breadth of product offerings. We believe that our ultracapacitor products and electrode material compete favorably with respect to these competitive factors. However, pricing expectations and competition in certain markets, such as auto and wind, places significant pressure on our pricing and margins for our products, and we are continually pursing opportunities to reduce the cost of our product in order to improve our competitive position and product margins. Specifically, the hybrid transit vehicle market for ultracapacitors in China, a region which has historically represented a significant portion of our sales, has become more competitive with respect to pricing and volume requirements due to changes in government subsidy programs which appear to favor battery based energy storage solutions and also place a requirement for local product manufacturing. We performed a very thorough analysis of the current market landscape and decided to very selectively target opportunities in this market in the short-term. At the same time, our partner in China, CRRC-SRI, has completed localization requirements for the manufacturing of our ultracapacitor-based modules, and we are positioned to support customer demand for any opportunities that may meet our minimum return requirements. 
Ultracapacitors also compete with products based on other technologies, including advanced batteries in power quality and peak power applications, as well as with flywheels, thermal storage and batteries in backup energy storage applications. We believe that the durability, long life, performance and value of ultracapacitors gives them a competitive advantage over these alternative choices in many applications. In addition, integration of ultracapacitors with some of these competing products may provide optimized solutions that neither product can provide by itself. For example, tier 1 auto parts supplier Continental AG designed a combined solution incorporating ultracapacitors with a battery for engine starting in a start-stop-idle elimination system for “micro hybrid” autos which was introduced in 2010 and installed in approximately two million cars by French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen and was more recently introduced by General Motors for several models under the Cadillac brand.
Research and Development
We maintain active research and development programs to improve existing products and to develop new products. In general, we focus our research and product development activities on:

• | designing and producing products that perform reliably for the life of the application or systems into which they are integrated;


• | designing efficient manufacturing with low scrap rates to achieve improved profit margins and to enable us to reduce prices to allow our products to penetrate new and price-sensitive applications;


• | designing our products to have superior technical performance;


• | designing our products to be compact and light;


• | designing new products that provide novel solutions to expand our market opportunities; and


• | designing new products that convert customer requirements into fully integrated system solutions with built-in intelligence and interface capabilities.

Our current research, development and engineering activities are focused on:

• | electrode fabrication and material science, including activated carbon, electrolyte, electrically conductive materials, dielectric materials and ceramics to reduce cost and improve performance, reliability and ease of manufacturing;


• | product design and manufacturing processes for high-volume manufacturing; and


• | development of integration technologies, including proprietary hardware and software solutions and robust mechanical designs, that are incorporated into complete “plug and play” system solutions.

Dry Battery Electrode
The principal focus for our dry battery electrode development efforts is to demonstrate the applicability of our high volume, low cost dry electrode fabrication process as it relates to state of the art lithium-ion battery electrode materials. Upon demonstration of this process in large scale, it is expected that our dry electrodes will deliver performance and cost advantages when compared to state of the art lithium-ion battery technology. 
Energy Storage
The principal focus of our ultracapacitor development activities is to increase power and energy density, reduce internal resistance, extend operational life, reduce manufacturing cost and increase integration with host applications. Our ultracapacitor designs focus on low-cost, high-capacity cells in standard sizes ranging from 1 to 3,400 farads, multi-cell modules based on various form factors and complete subsystem solutions using proprietary hardware, software and mechanical designs. Our system designs may be specific to a single customer or be intended for more general use by a variety of customers.
Intellectual Property
We place a strong emphasis on inventing, protecting and exploiting proprietary technologies, processes and designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. We place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection for our products, technologies and other strategic initiatives. Our continued success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing patents and to secure patent protection on developing technologies. As of December 31, 2018, we held 90 issued U.S. patents and 20 published pending U.S. patent applications, all of which relate to our core technologies, processes and designs, including our dry battery electrode and ultracapacitor products and technology.
Our pending and any future patent applications may not survive the challenges of patent prosecution in the jurisdictions in which we file throughout the world; however, our strategy is to focus on countries generating revenue as well as markets which we deem key to our business strategies and objectives. We routinely seek patent protection in the United States and the principal countries of Europe and Asia. At present, we do not rely on licenses from any third parties to produce our products.
Our existing patent portfolios and pending patent applications relate primarily to:
Dry Battery Electrode

• | compositions of the electrode, including its formulation, design and fabrication techniques; and


• | materials science associated with raw material components.

Energy Storage

• | compositions of the electrode, including its formulation, design and fabrication techniques;


• | materials science associated with raw material components;


• | physical cell package designs as well as the affiliated processes used in cell assembly;


• | cell-to-cell and module-to-module interconnect technologies that minimize equivalent series resistance and enhance the functionality, performance and longevity of ultracapacitor products including system level electronics; and


• | module and system designs that facilitate applications of ultracapacitor technology.

While our primary strategy for protecting our proprietary technologies, processes and designs is related to obtaining patents, we also apply for trademark registrations which identify us as the source of the products. Additionally, we promote our technologies, processes and designs in association with these registered trademarks to further distinguish our products from those of our competitors. As of December 31, 2018, we had five formal trademark registrations within the U.S.
Establishing and protecting proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent infringement, misappropriation or another misuse by third parties, or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
13

We use employee and third-party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. We require each of our employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all our proprietary information and, subject to certain exceptions, to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment with us. In addition, we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties, such as potential product development partners and customers, to protect any information disclosed in the pursuit of securing possible fruitful business endeavors.
Backlog
Product backlog as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $15.4 million, compared with $19.1 million as of December 31, 2017. Backlog consists of firm orders for products that will be delivered within 12 months. The actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors including potential cancellations of orders by our customers.
Significant Customers
Two customers, Beijing Etechwin and Continental Automotive, accounted for 12% and 11% of total revenue in 2018, respectively. Three customers, Continental Automotive, Beijing Etechwin and CRRC-SRI, accounted for 15%, 11% and 10% of total revenue in 2017, respectively. 
Government Regulation
Due to the nature of our operations, including, notably, the use of hazardous substances in some of our manufacturing and research and development activities, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing workplace safety and environmental protection. These include the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes. In the course of our historical operations, materials or wastes may have spilled or been released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials and wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties and the materials and wastes spilled, released, or disposed thereon are subject to environmental laws which may impose strict liability, without regard to fault of the original conduct, for remediation of contamination resulting from such releases. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remediate previously spilled, released, or disposed substances or wastes, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations also could result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and even the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our activities. It is also possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot be certain that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to unknown liabilities.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 367 employees in four countries, as follows: 196 full-time, 1 part-time and 2 temporary employees in the U.S.; 132 full-time employees in South Korea; 27 full-time employees in China; and 12 full-time employees in Germany.
