We believe that we have held a dominant market share in U.S. military wheeled vehicle operator driver training simulators since 1999 and that we are currently one of three significant participants in the U.S. municipal wheeled vehicle simulators market.
Air Warfare Simulations
In the area of Air Warfare Simulations, we believe we are a premier developer of validated, high fidelity analytical models and simulations of tactical air and land warfare systems for all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and its related industrial contractors. Our simulations are found in systems ranging from instrumented air combat and maneuver training ranges (such as Top Gun), full task training devices such as the F-18 Weapon Tactics Trainer, and in the on-board computer of many fighter jet aircraft. We supply on-board software to support weapon launch decisions for the F-15, F-16, F-18, F-22 and F-35 aircraft. Two of our key Air Warfare Simulations program areas are the Zone Acquisition Program (ZAP™) and our Combat Training System (CTS) weapon simulation solution. ZAP™ provides aircrew with weapon employment information using highly accurate high-speed weapon simulations embedded in the operational flight programs of all US fighter aircraft. CTS provides validated weapon simulations for use on combat training ranges and third party aircraft simulators. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, our Air Warfare Simulations group accounted for 30%, 38%, and 35%, respectively, of our Training and Simulation Division’s revenues. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Air Warfare Simulations group accounted for 17%, 19%, and 18%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.
Use-of-Force
We are a leading provider of interactive, multimedia, fully digital use-of-force training simulators for law enforcement, security, military and similar applications. With a large customer base spread over twenty countries around the world, we are a leader in the supply of simulation training products to law enforcement, governmental, and commercial clients.

The quality of our customer relationships is illustrated by the multiple program contract awards we have earned from many of our customers.
We also have long term relationships with original equipment manufacturers such as Boeing and Raytheon that result in continued business opportunities.
Competition
Our technical excellence, superior product reliability, high customer satisfaction and warranty services have enabled us to develop market leadership and attractive competitive positions in each of our product areas.
Vehicle Simulators
Several potential competitors in this segment are large, diversified defense and aerospace conglomerates, such as L-3 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) and Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS), who do not focus exclusively on our specific niches. 
5

As such, we are able to compete directly with these organizations based on our strength in developing higher quality software solutions or provide service on certain large military contracts through strategic agreements with these organizations. In municipal market applications, we compete against smaller, less sophisticated companies, such as Raydon Corporation and Doron Precision Systems, Inc., and some startups that rely on a commercial gaming engine as a training solution. Many of our large business competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours.
Air Warfare Simulations
Currently, we believe that no significant competitors participate in the markets we serve around our weapon simulation niche. Our over 45-year history in this space provides us with a library of resources that would require substantial investment by a competitor to offer a comparable product. The companies that have the potential to compete with us are companies that now subcontract this work to us: Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) (“Boeing”), Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) (“Raytheon”), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT).
Use of Force
We compete against a number of established companies that provide similar products and services, some of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. There are also companies whose products do not compete directly, but are sometimes closely related to the products we offer. Cubic Corporation (NYSE: CUB), Meggitt PLC (LSE: MGT), VirTra, Inc. (Nasdaq: VTSI), Ti Training Corp., and Laser Shot, Inc. are our main competitors in this space.
Power Systems Division
Our Power Systems Division develops and provides sophisticated portable power solutions for diverse applications, including military equipment carried by soldiers, hybrid energy generation/storage in austere environments, power management and power distribution, and clean, stable power for tactical vehicles, unmanned vehicles and medical devices, all of which are designed to complex and demanding customer specifications. During 2018, 2017, and 2016, revenues from our Power Systems Division were approximately $39.9 million, $48.5 million, and $46.6 million, respectively.
Electronics Engineering and Design Services for the Military
Introduction
We design, engineer, and manufacture proprietary electronics, spanning components and sub-assemblies, for a broad range of end use systems in multiple markets that include aerospace, defense, industrial and medical. We specialize in electronic/electromechanical systems, subsystems, and component level requirements, which include circuit card assemblies and wire and cable assemblies. Our products range from complex integrated assemblies up through multi-rack functional systems and test equipment.
In addition, we also specialize in core, proprietary engineering capabilities in highly-demanded solution areas, including: (i) hybrid power generation systems, (ii) smart power subsystems for military vehicles and dismounted applications, and (iii) aircraft and missile systems support for cutting-edge weapons and communications technologies. Our unique brand of comprehensive service is highly sought-after by customer agencies such as the Marine Corps Systems Command, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (“SPAWAR”), U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Research & Development Command (“CERDEC”) and Tank Automotive Command, as well as large prime contractors such as Raytheon, Science Applications International Corporation (NYSE: SAIC) (“SAIC”), Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), and BAE Systems plc (LON: BA) (“BAE”). Our key program areas in this field include the following:

• | We supply the United States Marine Corps (“USMC”) with its program of record Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network Systems (“GREENS”), a renewable power generation, intelligent energy storage and distribution system for troops serving in austere environments. GREENS is the only DoD Program of Record for renewable power generation. We also offer a commercial (not ITAR-restricted) version of this product, targeting both domestic and international markets where clean, reliable power in austere, rugged environments is a critical need.


• | We have supplied the USMC with Mobile Hybrid Expeditionary Energy System (“MHEES”), a product that incorporates both solar collection and high density battery technologies to intelligently reduce run time and optimize efficiency of tactical generators. This single system is scalable to 3.5kW, 7kW and 10.5kW output, making it an ideal solution for multiple military missions. During 2017, we delivered to the Marine Corps Systems Command the next-generation of MHEES, known as Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (“MEHPS”). MEHPS is a modular, scalable system capable of delivering clean, reliable three-phase power in a 5kW dismounted configuration as well as a 10kW trailer mounted configuration. UEC supported government testing in 2018.

6


• | We designed a proprietary Distributed Power Control and Management System (DPCMS) that could replace electrical systems on aging tactical vehicles such at the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) and Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV). This power management and distribution system enables vehicles that have already exceeded the OEM’s recommended life to be refurbished and to take advantage of new automotive communication protocol J-1939. These refurbishments could permit aging tactical vehicle fleets to function as a new vehicle, without the cost implications of replacing it with a new vehicle. This system was successfully tested on LAVs and AAVs by the USMC. DPCMS is also being marketed to newer vehicle systems that can benefit from its modular design and combat survivability features.


• | We have developed significant expertise and past performance qualifications in the area of solutions for Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), providing these solutions to, among others, SPAWAR and Raytheon.

Competition
Our main competitors for renewable energy and power management systems and services are ZeroBase Energy, LLC, a provider of hybrid and renewable power systems, and Solar Stik, Inc., a provider of portable and custom power solutions. In the realm of contract design and manufacturing services, we compete with Sechan Electronics Inc., a provider of military electronic systems and subsystems, IEC Electronics Corporation (NYSE: IEC), a provider of electronic contract manufacturing services, Celestica Incorporated (NYSE: CLS), Ducommun Incorporated (NYSE: DCO), Sanmina Corporation (Nasdaq: SANM), and Jabil Incorporated (NYSE: JBL), a supplier of manufacturing services for circuit board assemblies.
We believe the fact that we have full-service engineering coupled with state-of-the-art manufacturing provides us with an advantage over most of our competitors, enabling us to customize solutions for customers, quickly develop prototype and first-article units, and move into full-rate production before many of our competitors are beyond the requirements definition phase. We believe few in the industry have both the agility and capabilities required to offer this advantage. As a manufacturer, we build our own cable harnesses, circuit cards, and integrated complex assemblies, which enables us to control our own supply chain and program schedules. These combined capabilities have resulted in lower costs and shorter lead times, both very important discriminators for our customers in this current fiscal environment.
Marketing and Customers
We market to a diverse array of customers. The renewable and hybrid energy market prior to 2015 had been primarily focused on the U.S. Department of Defense. We believe we have achieved significant success in this market; however, we are modifying our products to better meet commercial/industrial demands. In addition, we are refocusing marketing efforts internationally on the heels of our GREENS and MHEES programs. Specific efforts include exhibiting at international trade shows like DSEI and Eurosatory, establishing international sales channels, establishing networks within U.S. commercial markets, and an increase in outbound marketing efforts designed to drive potential customers to our solutions.
Over 90% of revenues are attributed to existing customers with new requirements or referrals of new customers from our existing customer base. This customer loyalty is closely tied to our technical solutions, our on-time delivery and quality of product metrics (consistently 90% or greater).
Manufacturing
Our three AS9100 and ISO 9001 registered facilities are located in the tri-county area of Charleston, South Carolina. All facilities are well equipped with state of the art design tools and automated manufacturing equipment to support our customers’ design, testing, and production needs.
Lithium Batteries and Charging Systems for Military, Industrial and Medical Markets
We sell lithium batteries and charging systems, including the SWIPES™ power hubs that we produce for the Army’s Soldier Warrior program, to the military, industrial and medical markets.
We develop and produce high-end lithium batteries, both primary (disposable) and secondary (rechargeable), “smart” chargers for the rechargeable batteries, electronic sub-assemblies and back up batteries for a range of “Smart City” applications (such as cellular switches and security towers). Battery offerings include a growing line of standard products (such as the BB-2590, ELI-152, 6T NATO, and 12V/24V lead-acid replacement batteries) as well as high-end custom products. 
We market to the military, medical and industrial markets. We believe we are among the few companies in the world with the capability to develop, manufacture and test complex portable power sources needed by high-end portable applications. We perform the development and manufacturing in-house with the exception of the electrochemical cells, which we purchase from suppliers. We have also begun to penetrate the “special” batteries market, meaning large format batteries (such as those used to power submarines) and high power batteries (such as those used in missile launchers and battle tank emergency startup units).
7

We have experience in working with government agencies, the military and large corporations. Our technical team has significant expertise in the fields of electrochemistry, electronics, software and battery design, production, packaging and testing. We also specialize in custom products that must meet the highest possible military, industrial and medical specifications.
Our SWIPES™ power hub utilizes the MOLLE (Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) vest and integrates force protection electronics and communications equipment with an advanced battery. The system utilizes a modular power distribution system that is powered by a conformal wearable battery allowing for extended mission times without the burden of power source swaps or charging due to the conformal battery’s high energy density. It also reduces the battery weight soldiers carry by up to 30%. The batteries continuously charge the secondary batteries inside various devices, such as two way radios, GPS units and shot detection systems. 
Customers
The principal customers for our lithium batteries during 2018 were the Israel Ministry of Defense, Elbit Systems Ltd. (Nasdaq: ESLT), Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. (TASE: ARSP), and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. The principal customer for our soldier power systems in 2018 was the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, with interest also shown from the U.K. Ministry of Defence and the Polish Territorial Defence Force.

Backlog
We generally sell our products under standard purchase orders. Orders constituting our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and are typically cancelable by our customers until a specified time prior to the scheduled delivery date. Accordingly, our backlog is not necessarily an accurate indication of future sales. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our funded backlog was approximately $64.8 million, $61.1 million, and $55.4 million, respectively, divided between our divisions as follows:

Division | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Training and Simulation Division | $ | 47,291,000 | | | $ | 38,752,000 | | $ | 18,790,000
Power Systems Division | 17,554,000 | | | 22,349,000 | | | 36,584,000
TOTAL: | $ | 64,845,000 | | | $ | 61,101,000 | | $ | 55,374,000

Major Customers
During 2018, 2017, and 2016, including both of our divisions, various branches of the United States military accounted for approximately 35%, 33%, and 41%, respectively, of our revenues. See Part I - Item 1A. “Risk Factors” titled “Risks Related to Government Contracts,” below.
Patents and Trade Secrets
We rely on certain proprietary technology and seek to protect our interests through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and security measures, including confidentiality agreements. Our policy generally is to secure protection for significant innovations to the fullest extent practicable. Further, we seek to expand and improve the technological base and individual features of our products through ongoing research and development programs.
Our intellectual property portfolio includes five issued U.S. patents, which expire between 2019 and 2037. We also have various patent applications pending for examination in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
We rely on the laws of unfair competition and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other security measures. However, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Effective trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the United States. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
Research and Development
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our research and product development expenses were approximately $3.0 million, $3.0 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. Not included in these figures are any research and development where the costs were underwritten by customers or charged directly to projects as non-recovered engineering costs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 472 total employees worldwide, substantially all of whom were full-time employees. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees.
With respect to those of our employees who are Israeli residents, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment without due cause. We currently partially fund our ongoing severance obligations by making monthly payments to approved severance funds or insurance policies.
Raw Materials
We are dependent on the availability of raw materials from our suppliers. The most important raw materials are lithium cells and zinc for our batteries. We purchase these raw materials from various suppliers. We believe alternative sources generally exist for the raw materials used for our batteries.

Regulatory Matters
Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including, but not limited to, branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. We are also subject to export regulations. For additional information related to export regulations, see Part I - Item 1A. “Risk Factors” entitled “We may not be able to receive or retain the necessary licenses or authorizations required for us to export or re-export….”
Government Contracts
The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.
On October 3, 2018, our U.S. Power Systems Division subsidiary was informed by its customer, Science Applications International Corporation (“SAIC”), that the United States Marines Corps terminated for its convenience its efforts to modernize the Assault Amphibious Vehicle fleet that was undergoing survivability and electrical upgrades under a prime contract with SAIC. As a result of this termination for the USMC’s convenience, we presented our costs related to this program for reimbursement by SAIC and the USMC in December 2018. The amount of reimbursement and time frame for resolution have not yet been determined.
For additional information related to government contracts, see Part I - Item 1A. “Risk Factors” “Risks Related to Government Contracts.”
Environmental
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
