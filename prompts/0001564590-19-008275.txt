ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 Approach Resources Inc. is an independent energy company focused on the exploration, development, production and acquisition of unconventional oil and gas reserves in the Midland Basin of the greater Permian Basin in West Texas, where we lease approximately 150,000 net acres as of December 31, 2018. We believe our concentrated acreage position and extensive, integrated field infrastructure system provide us an opportunity to achieve cost, operating and recovery efficiencies in the development of our drilling inventory. Our long-term business strategy is to develop resource potential from the Wolfcamp shale oil formation and pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. See “— Our Business Strategy” below. Additional drilling targets could include the Clearfork, Canyon Sands, Strawn and Ellenburger zones. We sometimes refer to our development project in the Permian Basin as “Project Pangea,” which includes “Pangea West.” Our management and technical team have a proven track record of finding and developing reserves through advanced drilling and completion techniques. As the operator of all of our estimated proved reserves and production, we have a high degree of control over capital expenditures and other operating matters.
 At December 31, 2018, our estimated proved reserves were 180.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”). Substantially all of our proved reserves are located in Crockett and Schleicher Counties, Texas. The following are important characteristics of our proved reserves at December 31, 2018:
  
• | 29% oil, 31% NGLs and 40% natural gas;
--+---------------------------------------


• | 37% proved developed;
--+----------------------


• | 100% operated;
--+---------------


• | Reserve life of approximately 44 years based on 2018 production of 4.1 MMBoe;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (“standardized measure”) of $660 million; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PV-10 (non-GAAP) of $761.8 million.
--+------------------------------------

 PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates for future income taxes. Estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their present value. PV-10 is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), and generally differs from the standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future cash flows. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure, as computed under GAAP. See Item 2. “Properties — Proved Oil and Gas Reserves” for a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure.
 At December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 813 producing oil and gas wells in the Permian Basin. During 2018, we produced 4.1 MMBoe, or 11.2 MBoe/d. Production for 2018 was 26% oil, 36% NGLs and 38% natural gas.

Our Business Strategy
Our long-term business strategy is to create value by growing reserves and production in a cost efficient manner and at attractive rates of return by pursuing the strategies discussed below. However, the rate of growth of our reserves and production, as well as achievable rates of return, depend on commodity prices and the availability of capital. 
 In response to deteriorating and volatile commodity prices, we substantially reduced our drilling activity beginning in 2015, which has led to a natural decline in production. Commodity prices have continued to remain volatile and have drastically fallen again in 2018, which has resulted in unanticipated delays in our ability to resume and accelerate our drilling activity over the last several years. In order to address the effect of the sustained commodity price volatility and deterioration on our business strategy and financial metrics, we have pursued, and currently are pursuing or considering, a number of alternatives to strengthen our balance sheet and resume production growth. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding our plans to improve our leverage and our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. 
 In order to improve our leverage position to meet upcoming financial covenants under the revolving credit facility, we have been, and currently are, pursuing or considering a number of deleveraging and strategic actions, which in certain cases may require the consent of current lenders, stockholders or bond holders. On April 12, 2018, our largest shareholder, Wilks Brothers, LLC, and its affiliate SDW Investments, LLC (collectively, “Wilks”), disclosed on Schedule 13D/A that they intended to engage in discussions with the Company regarding their investment in the Company, including the possible acquisition of additional shares of common stock through the exchange of approximately $60 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Senior Notes”) currently held by Wilks (the “Exchange Transaction”). In April 2018, our board of directors formed a committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to evaluate a potential Exchange Transaction as well as other strategic alternatives. The Special Committee hired financial and legal advisors to advise the Special Committee on these matters.  The Special Committee engaged in discussions with Wilks regarding an Exchange Transaction in 2018, but in mid-2018 the Wilks and the Committee deferred further discussions regarding a stand-alone Exchange Transaction pending resolution of the Company’s discussions regarding the potential transaction described in the following paragraph. 
 
In addition, management has reviewed numerous cash flow producing properties for potential acquisition over the last several years in order to grow our production base and reduce our leverage ratio to a sustainable level and one that is in compliance with our financial covenants.  In early 2018, we retained a financial advisor, separate from the Special Committee’s advisor, and began discussions with a potential seller and multiple financing counterparties for the purchase of a set of substantial cash flow producing properties.  Despite a deteriorating commodity price market, discussions with both the seller and financing parties progressed throughout 2018.  However, no definitive agreements ultimately were executed, and the negotiations currently are not active.
 In March 2019, our board of directors expanded the scope of the Special Committee to explore, in addition to an Exchange Transaction, other financing alternatives and deleveraging transactions, including without lim
itation (i) amendments or waivers to the covenants or other provisions of our revolving credit facility, (ii) raising new capital in private or public markets and (iii) restructuring our balance sheet either in court or through an out of court agreement with creditors. We are also considering operational matters such as adjusting our capital budget and improving cash flows from operations by continuing to reduce costs, and intend to continue to pursue and consider other strategic alternatives, including: (i) acquiring assets with existing production and cash flows by issuing preferred and common equity to finance such acquisitions; (ii) selling existing producing or midstream assets; (iii) merging with a strategic partner. The Special Committee has re-commenced discussions with the Wilks regarding an Exchange Transaction and intends to continue those discussions as part of its review of financing alternatives and deleveraging transactions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement any of these plans successfully, or that such plans, if executed, will result in compliance with our credit facility covenants.
 We also continue to position ourselves to increase our drilling activity at a measured and disciplined pace, and resume production growth in the event of a continued and sustained commodity price recovery, by focusing on the following strategies:
  
• | Strengthen our balance sheet and financial flexibility. We intend to continue to explore a broad range of deleveraging alternatives as discussed above.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2
 

 
• | Acquire strategic and complementary assets. We continually review opportunities to acquire producing properties, undeveloped acreage and drilling prospects. We focus particularly on opportunities where we believe our operational efficiency, reservoir management and geological expertise in unconventional oil and gas properties will enhance value and performance. We remain focused on unconventional resource opportunities, but we will also consider conventional opportunities based on individual project economics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop our Wolfcamp shale oil resource play. We believe our current acreage position provides us the long-term ability to increase reserves and production at competitive costs and at attractive rates of return when commodity prices improve. During 2018, we drilled six, and completed nine, horizontal Wolfcamp wells, and entered 2019 with an inventory of seven drilled horizontal wells waiting on completion. With our 2019 drilling plan, we expect to continue to develop our core properties in Project Pangea, subject to commodity prices. Focusing on the Wolfcamp shale oil play allows us to use our operating, technical and regional expertise important to interpreting geological and operating trends, enhancing production rates and maximizing well recovery. In addition, our inventory of drilled wells waiting on completion allows us to increase production with lower marginal capital expenditures.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operate our properties as a low-cost producer. We believe our concentrated acreage position in the Midland Basin enables us to capture economies of scale and operating efficiencies. Through our investment in extensive integrated field infrastructure, including water transportation and recycling systems, centralized production facilities, gas lift lines and saltwater disposal wells, we have significantly reduced drilling and completion costs, per-unit lease operating expenses and our fresh water use over the last three years. In addition, because we operate 100% of our reserve base, we are able to better manage timing and scope of capital expenditures and control costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operate our business at or near cash-flow breakeven. In 2019, we have set our expected capital expenditure budget to a range of $30 million to $60 million. We believe that over the long term we will be able to maintain and grow production substantially out of operating cash flow. We have the operational flexibility to adjust our capital spending upward in response to a commodity price recovery. Operating our business at or near operating cash flow allows us to preserve liquidity so that we will be able to accelerate execution of our long-term strategy should commodity prices further recover. Because we operate 100% of our reserve base, we also have the flexibility to adjust our capital budget downward in response to commodity price decreases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mitigate commodity price volatility. We enter into commodity derivative contracts to partially mitigate the risk of commodity price volatility. For 2018, we hedged approximately 57%, 61% and 63% of our natural gas, NGLs and oil production, respectively. For 2019, we currently have 182,500 Bbls of oil hedged at a floor price of $65.00 per Bbl and a ceiling price of $71.00 per Bbl and 239,575 Bbls of NGLs hedged at weighted average prices of $14.12 per Bbl (C2-ethane), $36.54 per Bbl (C3-propane), $38.63 per Bbl (NC4-butane) and $65.21 per Bbl (C5 – Pentane).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 We have a number of competitive strengths, which we believe will help us to successfully execute our business strategies:
  
• | Lower-risk, liquids-rich asset base. We have assembled a strong asset base within the Midland Basin, where we have a long history of operating. We have drilled more than 800 wells in the area since 2004. Our acreage position of 150,000 net, primarily contiguous acres in the Midland Basin provides us with a multi-year inventory of repeatable, horizontal and vertical drilling locations that we believe create the opportunity for us to deliver long-term reserve, production and cash flow growth. Production for 2018 was 62% liquids (26% oil and 36% NGLs) and 38% natural gas. With a liquids-rich but diverse production base, we are able to capture the upside of improvement in commodity prices in any one of our three production streams. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Installation of field infrastructure and water handling systems. Our large, mostly contiguous acreage position and our success in the Wolfcamp shale oil play led us to invest over $125 million in building field infrastructure since 2012. We have an extensive network of centralized production facilities, water transportation, handling and recycling systems, gas lift lines and saltwater disposal wells. In addition,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3
 

 
we believe the infrastructure reduces the need for trucks, reduces fresh water usage, improves drilling and completion efficiencies and drives down drilling and completion and operating costs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High degree of operational control. We operate 100% of our estimated proved reserves, and we have approximately 98.5% working interest in Project Pangea. This allows us to more effectively manage and control the timing of capital spending on our development activities, as well as maximize benefits from operating cost efficiencies and field infrastructure systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proactive financial management. In 2018, we executed a disciplined capital expenditure program, spending 22% less than the midpoint of our annual budget. As of December 31, 2018, we had liquidity of approximately $23.2 million. In 2017, we completed a debt-for-equity exchange which reduced the outstanding principal of our long-term debt by $145.1 million, extended the term on our revolving credit facility by one year to May 7, 2020, and completed an acquisition of producing Wolfcamp shale assets adjacent to our Project Pangea acreage. Currently, we are continuing to evaluate a broad range of transactions to reduce our leverage. We also enter into commodity derivative contracts to partially mitigate the risk of commodity price volatility. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced management team with track record of growth. Our management team has extensive industry experience, including significant technical and exploration expertise. Our management team has specific expertise in the Permian Basin and in successfully executing multi-year development drilling programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2018 Activity
 Our 2018 activity focused on executing a disciplined capital budget in connection with slowly recovering commodity prices, strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining a competitive operating cost structure. We drilled six, and completed nine, horizontal wells in 2018 in the Wolfcamp shale oil resource play in the Midland Basin. We plan to continue to develop the Wolfcamp shale in Project Pangea in 2019, at a measured pace subject to commodity prices, capital availability and leverage restrictions. Our 2018 activities included:

• | Executed a disciplined capital budget and managed production decline. In 2018, we incurred capital expenditures of $46.8 million, spending 22% less than the midpoint of our annual budget, and we deferred well completions scheduled in the fourth quarter due to the sharp decrease in commodity prices. During 2018, we drilled six, and completed nine, horizontal Wolfcamp wells, and entered 2019 with an inventory of seven drilled horizontal wells waiting on completion. Production for 2018 totaled 4.1 MMBoe (11.2 MBoe/d) compared to 4.2 MMBoe (11.6 MBoe/d) in 2017, a decrease of 4%. Production for 2018 was 26% oil, 36% NGLs and 38% natural gas.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintained competitive operating cost structure. Utilizing our infrastructure and field-level expertise, we maintained an industry leading average drilling and completion cost of $4.6 million per horizontal well and lease operating expense per Boe of $5.18. Additionally, in 2018, we reduced general and administrative expenses by $3.4 million, or 14%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delineation of the multi-zone potential of the Wolfcamp shale. The Wolfcamp shale has a gross pay thickness of approximately 1,000 to 1,200 feet, which allows for stacked wellbores targeting three different zones that we call “benches.” We believe effectively developing the Wolfcamp shale may involve up to three lateral wellbores, each targeting a different bench, which we refer to as the Wolfcamp A, B and C. As of December 31, 2018, we had drilled and completed a total of 25 wells targeting the Wolfcamp A bench, 115 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B bench and 56 wells targeting the Wolfcamp C bench. We have successful wells targeting each of the Wolfcamp benches, and we continued development of the Wolfcamp shale in 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Plans for 2019
 For 2019, we have set our capital expenditure budget to a range of $30 million to $60 million, compared to $46.8 million of capital expenditures in 2018. We plan to operate one rig on an intermittent basis during the year in Project Pangea. Our 2019 capital budget excludes acquisitions and lease extensions and renewals and is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, results of horizontal drilling and completions, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, the 
 4
 

availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms. The eventual results of our strategic and deleveraging efforts may have a substantial impact on the Company’s capital expenditure budget. Although the impact of changes in these collective factors in the current commodity price environment is difficult to estimate, we currently expect to execute our development plan based on current conditions. To the extent there is a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices in the future or a change to our capital structure, we will assess the impact on our development plan at that time, and we may respond to such changes by altering our capital budget or our development plan.
 Markets and Customers
 The revenues generated by our operations are highly dependent upon the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities, and therefore, we receive market-based pricing. The price we receive for our oil, NGLs and natural gas production depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including supply and demand for oil, NGLs and gas, seasonality, the condition of the domestic and global economies, particularly in the manufacturing sectors, political conditions in other oil and gas producing countries, the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, NGLs and gas, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of federal, state and local regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to American Midstream, LP (“AMID”) and DCP Midstream, LP (“DCP”) accounted for approximately 56% and 41%, respectively, of our total sales. As of December 31, 2018, we had dedicated the majority of our oil production from northern Project Pangea and Pangea West through September 2022 to AMID. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had dedicated the majority of our NGLs and natural gas production from Project Pangea to DCP through August 2023.
 Commodity Derivative Activity
 We enter into commodity swap and collar contracts to mitigate portions of the risk of market price fluctuations related to future oil, NGLs and gas production. Our derivative contracts are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value on our balance sheet, and the change in a derivative contract’s fair value is recognized as current income or expense on our consolidated statements of operations.
 In 2018, we recognized a commodity derivative loss of $0.3 million, and the estimated fair value of our derivatives contracts at December 31, 2018, was a net asset of $5.9 million. For 2019, we currently have 182,500 Bbls of oil hedged at a floor price of $65.00 per Bbl and a ceiling price of $71.00 per Bbl and 239,575 Bbls of NGLs hedged at weighted average prices of $14.12 per Bbl (C2-ethane), $36.54 per Bbl (C3-propane), $38.63 per Bbl (NC4-butane) and $65.21 per Bbl (C5 – Pentane).
 Title to Properties
 Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business.
 We believe that we generally have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we make a general investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties. We receive title opinions of counsel before we commence drilling operations. We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets. Although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases, we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business.
 5
 

Oil and Gas Leases
 The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGLs and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 80% to 75%.
Seasonality
 Demand for NGLs and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations.
Competition
 The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete for personnel, prospective properties, producing properties and services with a substantial number of other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and gas, carry on refining operations and market the end products on a worldwide basis. We also face competition from alternative fuel sources, including coal, heating oil, imported LNG, nuclear and other nonrenewable fuel sources, and renewable fuel sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and biomass. Competitive conditions may also be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time-to-time by the United States government. It is not possible to predict whether such legislation or regulation may ultimately be adopted or its precise effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil, NGLs and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of our operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important process in oil and gas production and has been commonly used in the completion of unconventional oil and gas wells in shale and tight sand formations since the 1950s. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and gas production. It is important to us because it provides access to oil and gas reserves that previously were uneconomical to produce.
 We have used hydraulic fracturing to complete both horizontal and vertical wells in the Permian Basin. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing services to us for completion of these wells. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will be required in the future to develop the proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. All of our proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling will require hydraulic fracturing.
 We believe we have followed, and intend to continue to follow, applicable industry standard practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations. These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water zones as determined by applicable state regulatory agencies and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This aspect of well design is intended to prevent contact between the fracturing fluid and any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure-tested before perforating the new completion interval.
 Injection rates and pressures are monitored at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. We believe we have adequate procedures in place to address abrupt changes to the injection pressure or annular pressure.
 6
 

Texas regulations currently require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. More than 99% (by mass) of the ingredients we use in hydraulic fracturing are water and sand. The remainder of the ingredients are chemical additives that are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements in Texas.
 Hydraulic fracturing requires the use of a significant amount of water. Currently our primary sources of water in Project Pangea are the nonpotable Santa Rosa and potable Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers. We use water from on-lease water wells that we have drilled, and we purchase water from off-lease water wells. We have historically reused and recycled flowback and produced water and intend to do so in the future.  Any flowback water that is not recycled in a way that we believe minimizes the impact to nearby surface water is disposed into approved disposal facilities or injection wells.
 For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please read “Business — Regulation — Environmental Laws and Regulation.” For related risks to our stockholders, please read “Risk Factors — Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives and private litigation relating to hydraulic fracturing could stop or delay our development project and result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions;” “—  Our operations substantially depend on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or recycle water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely or cost-effective manner”; “— Climate change legislation or regulations regulating emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce”; and “—Environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.”
 Regulation
 The oil and gas industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the federal level, various federal rules, regulations and procedures apply, including those issued by the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) (Office of Pipeline Safety), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). At the state and local level, various agencies and commissions regulate drilling, production and midstream activities. These federal, state and local authorities have various permitting, licensing and bonding requirements. Various remedies are available for enforcement of these federal, state and local rules, regulations and procedures, including fines, penalties, revocation of permits and licenses, actions affecting the value of leases, wells or other assets, suspension of production, and, in certain cases, criminal prosecution. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not incur liability for fines, penalties or other remedies that are available to these federal, state and local authorities. However, we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with federal, state and local rules and regulations, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
 Transportation and Sale of Oil
 Sales of crude oil and condensate are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission (“FERC”) pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct 1992”), and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products, be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates, terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC.
 Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are also subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. As effective interstate and intrastate rates apply equally to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
 7
 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
 The transportation of oil by truck is also subject to federal, state and local rules and regulations, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Regulations under these statutes cover the security and transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the DOT.
 Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas and NGLs
 FERC regulates interstate gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC also regulates interstate NGLs pipelines under various federal laws and regulations. Although FERC does not regulate oil and gas producers such as Approach, FERC’s actions are intended to facilitate increased competition within all phases of the oil and gas industry and its regulation of third-party pipelines and facilities could indirectly affect our ability to transport or market our production. To date, FERC’s policies have not materially affected our business or operations.
 Regulation of Production
 Oil, NGLs and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations, as well as under requirements of local governmental authorities. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state in which we operate, Texas, has regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, Texas imposes a severance tax on production and sales of oil, NGLs and gas within its jurisdiction. In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, local land use restrictions could restrict or prohibit the location and/or performance of well drilling. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties, delays in operations, and increased costs of operations. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 In the United States, the exploration for and development of oil and gas and the drilling and operation of wells, fields and gathering systems are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and the release of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits or authorizations before drilling and production begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require the installation of expensive pollution controls or emissions monitoring equipment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.

Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with environmental laws, regulations and permits, and violations are subject to injunction, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. The effects of existing and future laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The historical trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretations of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly permitting, reporting, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, accidental releases or spills and ground water or surface water contamination may occur in the course of our operations, and we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases, spills or contamination, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future.
 The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business operations. The outcome of the Trump administration’s actions related to the rollback or modification of some of these laws, rules and regulations remains unclear due to ongoing litigation and rulemaking. 
 Hazardous Substance Release
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources and certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment as a result of oil and gas operations. Crude oil and fractions of crude oil are excluded from regulation under CERCLA (often referred to as the “petroleum exclusion”). Nevertheless, many chemicals commonly used at oil and gas production facilities fall outside of CERCLA’s petroleum exclusion. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received notification that we may be responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.
Waste Handling
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the authorization and oversight of the EPA, individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. The EPA also retains enforcement authority in any state-administered RCRA programs.  Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now regulated as non-hazardous could be regulated under RCRA as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could increase our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We currently own or lease properties that for many years have been used for oil and gas exploration, production and development activities. Although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials 
 9
 

disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws or other laws that regulate releases or waste from oil and gas operations. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or contamination, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
 Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions, permitting programs and other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions at specified sources. For example, under the EPA’s New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) regulations, since January 1, 2015, owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use so-called “green completion” technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented.  In 2016, the EPA issued additional rules known as NSPS Subpart OOOOa for the oil and gas industry to reduce emissions of methane, VOCs and other compounds.  These rules apply to certain sources of air emissions that were constructed, reconstructed, or modified after September 18, 2015.  Among other things, the new rules impose green completion requirements on new hydraulically fractured or re-fractured oil wells and leak detection and repair requirements at well sites, although in October 2018, the EPA released proposed revisions to some of those NSPS Subpart OOOOa requirements, including reducing the required frequency of fugitive emissions monitoring at well sites and compressor stations, creating uncertainty as to the future and scope of these rules.  Regardless, we do not expect that the currently applicable NSPS or NESHAP requirements will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permitting requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with existing or new requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
 While Congress has, from time-to-time, considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal legislation, a number of states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs or other mechanisms. Most cap-and-trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Many states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal CAA. The EPA has adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA, one of which purports to regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other of which would regulate emissions of GHGs from large stationary sources of emissions, such as power plants or industrial facilities. The motor vehicle rule was finalized in 2010 and became effective in 2011, but it did not require immediate reductions in GHG emissions. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to limit carbon emissions from new power plants and simultaneously released a final rule to limit carbon emissions from existing power plants (the latter rule is also known as the “Clean Power Plan”). The Clean Power Plan has been heavily litigated since its promulgation, and the decision by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2018 to continue to hold a number of consolidated Clean Power Plan cases in abeyance without yet ruling on the merits of the Clean Power Plan has contributed to the current uncertainty as to the Clean Power Plan’s future.  Further, the EPA under the Trump 
 10
 

administration proposed in October 2017 to repeal the Clean Power Plan and in August 2018 to replace it with the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) Rule.  The regulatory procedures required to complete the repeal of the Clean Power Plan and/or to finalize the ACE Rule may take years, however.  If the Clean Power Plan regulations ultimately are upheld or replaced, it could have a significant impact on the electrical generation industry and may favor the use of natural gas over other fossil fuels such as coal in new plants.  In the past, the EPA has also indicated that it will propose new GHG emissions standards for refineries, but we do not know when the agency will issue specific regulations.
 In 2010, the EPA enacted final rules on mandatory reporting of GHGs. The EPA has also subsequently issued amendments to the rules containing technical and clarifying changes to certain GHG reporting requirements. Under the GHG reporting rules, certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities are required to report their GHG emissions on an annual basis. Our operations in the Permian Basin are subject to the EPA’s mandatory GHG reporting rules, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such rules. We do not expect that the EPA’s mandatory GHG reporting requirements, as currently promulgated, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The adoption of additional legislation or regulatory programs to monitor, permit, or reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs to comply with those requirements, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or obtain permits. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Water Discharges
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure regulations promulgated under the CWA impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) Plans. Where applicable to our operations, we prepare and implement SPCC Plans to prevent releases of oil from our facilities or, if a release occurs, to mitigate the consequences of such release. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
 In 2016, the EPA issued a final rule banning the disposal of wastewater from unconventional oil and gas wells to public wastewater and sewage treatment plants. Produced and other flowback water from our current operations in the Permian Basin is typically not discharged to wastewater treatment plants but is either re-injected into underground formations that do not contain potable water or recycled for reuse in our hydraulic fracturing operations. 
 The Safe Drinking Water Act, Groundwater Protection and the Underground Injection Control Program
 Fluids associated with oil and gas production result from operations on the Company’s properties and may be disposed by injection in underground disposal wells. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control program (the “UIC program”) promulgated under the SDWA and state programs regulate the drilling and operation of saltwater disposal wells. The EPA has delegated administration of the UIC program for Class II injection wells (including saltwater disposal wells) in Texas to the Railroad Commission of Texas (“RRC”). Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking saltwater to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and gas drilling, production and related operations may result in fines, penalties and remediation 
 11
 

costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third-party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and bodily injury.
 In addition, several cases have recently spotlighted the issue of whether injection wells may be regulated under the CWA if a direct hydrological connection to jurisdictional surface water can be established. The split among federal circuit courts of appeals that decided these cases engendered two petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court in August 2018, one of which was granted in February 2019. Those petitions are currently pending. The EPA has also brought attention to the reach of the CWA’s jurisdiction in such instances by issuing a request for comment in February 2018 regarding the applicability of the CWA permitting program to discharges into groundwater with a direct hydrological connection to jurisdictional surface water, which hydrological connections should be considered “direct,” and whether such discharges would be better addressed through other federal or state programs. To date, no further action has been taken by the EPA with respect to the issue, but should CWA permitting be required for saltwater injections wells, the costs of permitting and compliance for our operations could increase.
 Currently, the Company believes that disposal well operations on its properties substantially comply with all applicable requirements under the SDWA and RRC rules. However, a change in the regulations or in how courts or governmental agencies interpret existing laws or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the Company’s ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of the Company’s operations. For example, there exists a growing concern that the injection of saltwater and other fluids into underground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including in some parts of Texas. In response to these concerns, in 2014, the RRC published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the RRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. These recent seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells impose more stringent permitting requirements and are likely to result in added costs to comply or perhaps may require alternative methods of disposing of saltwater and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is the subject of significant focus among some environmentalists, regulators and the general public. Concerns over potential hazards associated with the use of hydraulic fracturing and its impact on the environment have been raised at all levels, including federal, state and local, as well as internationally. There have been claims that hydraulic fracturing may contaminate groundwater, reduce air quality or cause earthquakes. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use and disposal of water, and public concern has been growing over the adequacy of the water supply.
 The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempts hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the SDWA, prohibits the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing process without a UIC permit. In the past, legislation has been introduced in, but not passed by, Congress that would amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption. For example, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act (“FRAC Act”) has been introduced in each chamber of Congress since 2009 and the Fracking Disclosure and Safety Act was introduced in the current term of Congress, which commenced in January 2019, to accomplish this purposes. If legislation repealing the exemption were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements beyond those currently required by state regulatory agencies.
 12
 

In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC program by posting a requirement on its website that requires facilities to obtain permits to use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations. Following a legal challenge by industry groups and a subsequent settlement, in 2014, the EPA issued revised guidance on the use of diesel in hydraulic fracturing operations. Under the guidance, EPA broadly defined “diesel” to include fuels such as kerosene that have not traditionally been considered diesel. The EPA’s continued assertion of its regulatory authority under the SDWA could result in extensive requirements that could cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process.
 In addition to the above actions of the EPA, certain members of Congress have, in the past, called upon government agencies to investigate various aspects of hydraulic fracturing. Federal agencies that have been involved in hydraulic fracturing research include the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior and the Energy Information Administration. The EPA has also studied the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water resources, publishing a final report in 2016. These and future investigations and studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could facilitate initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
 Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in 2011, the RRC enacted a rule requiring disclosure to the RRC and the public of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In 2015, the Texas Legislature enacted House Bill 40, which prohibits local governments from prohibiting hydraulic fracturing but allows for commercially reasonable regulations of certain activities associated with oil and gas development. If future laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or that allow greater local government regulation of hydraulic fracturing are adopted, it could become more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce oil and gas from shale and tight sands formations and become easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and higher costs. These new laws or regulations could cause us to incur substantial delays or suspensions of operations and increased compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Threatened and Endangered Species, Migratory Birds and Natural Resources
 Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds and their habitat, wetlands and other natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the CWA and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of, or harm to, species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to restrict or prevent oil and gas exploration or production activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or production activities, including, for example, for releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and may seek natural resources damages and, in some cases, criminal penalties.
 OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal OSHA and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the general duty clause and Risk Management Planning regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the CAA, and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed in our operations. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of pollutants. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.
 13
 

Compliance
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations that apply to our current operations and that our ongoing compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We did not incur any material expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital or operating expenditures during 2019. However, the passage of additional or more stringent laws or regulations in the future could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to develop our undeveloped acreage.
Employees
 As of February 19, 2019, we had 99 full-time employees, 61 of whom are field personnel. We regularly use independent contractors and consultants to perform various field and other services. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are excellent.
Insurance Matters
 As is common in the oil and gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
