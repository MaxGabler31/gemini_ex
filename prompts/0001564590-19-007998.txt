Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview
 Select Interior Concepts, Inc. (collectively with all of its subsidiaries, “SIC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is an installer and nationwide distributor of interior building products with market positions in residential interior design services. 
 Through our Residential Design Services (which we refer to as “RDS”) operating segment, we serve national and regional homebuilders by providing an integrated, outsourced solution for the design, consultation, sourcing, distribution and installation needs of their homebuyer customers. Through our 21 design centers, our consultants work closely with homebuyers in the selection of a broad array of interior products and finishes, including flooring, cabinets, countertops, wall tile, finish carpentry, shower enclosures and mirrors, and related interior items, primarily for newly constructed homes. We then coordinate the ordering, fulfillment and installation of many of these interior products to provide a streamlined experience for the homebuyer. With our design centers and our product sourcing and installation capabilities, we enable our homebuilder customers to outsource critical aspects of their business to us, thereby increasing their sales, profitability, and return on capital.  
 We also have leading market positions in the selection and importation of natural and engineered stone slabs for kitchen and bathroom countertops and specialty tiles through our Architectural Surfaces Group (which we refer to as “ASG”) operating segment. ASG sources natural and engineered stone from a global supply base, and markets these materials through a national network of distribution centers and showrooms at 23 different locations. In addition to serving the new residential and commercial construction markets with these materials, we also distribute them to the repair and remodel (which we refer to as “R&R”) market.
 Our History
 The SIC platform originated in September 2014, when affiliates of Trive Capital Management LLC (which we refer to as “Trive Capital”) acquired RDS, which in turn acquired the assets of PT Tile Holdings, LP (which we refer to as “Pinnacle”) in February 2015, and 100% of the equity interests in Greencraft Holdings, LLC (which we refer to as “Greencraft”) in December 2017. In 2018, RDS then acquired the assets of Summit Stoneworks, LLC (which we refer to as “Summit”) in August 2018, and 100% of the equity interests in T.A.C. Ceramic Tile Co. (which we refer to as “TAC”) in December 2018. 
 Affiliates of Trive Capital also formed a consolidation platform in the stone countertop market by acquiring 100% of the equity interests in Architectural Granite & Marble, LLC in June 2015, which in turn acquired the assets of Bermuda Import-Export, Inc. (which we refer to as “Modul”) in July 2016, 100% of the equity interests in Pental Granite and Marble, LLC (which we refer to as “Pental”) in February 2017, and the assets of Cosmic Stone & Tile Distributors, Inc. (which we refer to as “Cosmic”) in October 2017, and these acquired businesses were combined to form ASG. ASG then acquired the assets of Elegant Home Design, LLC (which we refer to as “Bedrock”) in January 2018, the assets of NSI, LLC (which we refer to as “NSI”) in March 2018, and the assets of The Tuscany Collection, LLC (which we refer to as “Tuscany”) in August 2018.  
 November 2017 Restructuring Transactions
 In November 2017, Select Interior Concepts, Inc. and the former equity holders of RDS and ASG completed a series of restructuring transactions (collectively, the “November 2017 restructuring transactions”) pursuant to which Select Interior Concepts, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in each of RDS and ASG, including all of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Following the November 2017 restructuring transactions, Select Interior Concepts, Inc. became a holding company that wholly owns RDS and ASG.

Listing of our Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market
 On August 13, 2018, our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”), and on August 16, 2018 our Class A Common Stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SIC.”
Residential Design Services
 RDS enters into exclusive service agreements with homebuilders at the beginning of certain new community development projects to provide them with a single-source solution for the design center operations, consultation, sourcing, fulfillment, and installation phases of the homebuilding process. At our design centers, our design staff work directly with homebuyers to help them achieve their design, styling, and product needs, leveraging our web-based preference analysis and proprietary software system to enable real-time pricing of interior options.  
 During the initial design phase of a new residential development, RDS often assists builders with upfront planning of design elements and interior options. These alternatives then become the standard packages and design options which are the basis from which the new homebuyer makes upgrade selections. During the initial construction phase, RDS offers a full suite of interior customization options to homebuyers in its design centers, providing the opportunity to upgrade to higher priced options that are not part of the homebuilder’s standard package. These upgrades result in higher revenue and profitability for both RDS and the homebuilder, who shares in the incremental revenue from any upgrades. RDS also provides installation services, ensuring that the finished product meets the homebuyer’s specifications.
 RDS’ collection of design options enables homebuyers to customize their homes with high quality interior finishes and provides homebuilders with a single partner to handle the majority of the interior design elements in a new home. RDS offers numerous interior surface categories which includes flooring, cabinets, countertops and wall tile, finish carpentry and shower enclosures and mirrors.
 Architectural Surfaces Group
 Our ASG segment imports and distributes natural and engineered stone slabs, as well as tile, through 23 strategically positioned warehouse locations across the United States. Our stone slabs include marble, granite, and quartz, for use as kitchen and bathroom countertops, and our tiles consist of ceramic and porcelain for flooring, backsplash, and wall tile applications. We maintain a broad domestic footprint of showrooms and distribution centers, serving markets in the Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Mountain West, and West Coast regions of the United States and offer a targeted merchandising strategy, including displaying our products in customer-oriented showrooms that cater to professional interior designers and architects as well as homeowners. We carry product lines of natural and engineered stone slabs and tile products that are tailored to the specific geographic regions that we serve.
 We have relationships with a wide array of stone slab quarries, manufacturers and distributors around the world and offer our customers a broad and consistent selection of high-quality stone slabs from a global supply chain. We have successfully secured exclusive rights to leading materials that are marketed under ASG’s MetroQuartz ® and PentalQuartz ® brands.
 Competition
 Our markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We face competition from large home improvement stores, national and regional interior surface retailers and distributors, and independent design centers. Some of our competitors are organizations that are larger, are better capitalized, have operated longer, have product offerings that extend beyond our product suite, and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel, and other resources than we have. In addition, while we believe that there is a relatively low threat of new internet-only entrants due to the nature of our products, the growth opportunities presented by e-commerce could outweigh these challenges and result in increased competition.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of approximately 1,360 employees. None of these employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to our businesses generally in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to employment, import and export, public health and safety, work place safety, product safety, transportation, zoning, and the environment. We operate our businesses in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations.
Insurance and Risk Management
 We use a combination of insurance policies specific to particular purposes to provide us with protection against potential liability for workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, employer’s liability, property damage, auto liability, and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in workers’ compensation and general liability premiums and deductibles, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of these matters are generally not presently determinable, we do not believe that any of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Intellectual Property
 We possess proprietary knowledge and software programs, as well as registered trademarks that are important to our businesses. We make, and will continue to make, efforts to protect our intellectual property rights; however, the actions taken by us may be inadequate to prevent others from using similar intellectual property.
