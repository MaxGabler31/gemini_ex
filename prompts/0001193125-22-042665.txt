Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 On November 19, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 23,000,000 units (the “units”), including the issuance of 3,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230 million. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the “private placement”) of an aggregate of 9,650,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to Zanite Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating proceeds to the Company of $9,650,000. 
 Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on August 7, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares (the “founder shares”) of our Class B common stock (the “Class B common stock”) to our Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On October 15, 2020, our Sponsor transferred 250,000 founder shares to Ronald D. Sugar, our senior advisor, and 150,000 founder shares to each of John B. Veihmeyer, Larry R. Flynn and Gerard J. DeMuro, our then directors, resulting in our Sponsor holding 5,050,000 founder shares. 
 A total of $232,300,000, comprised of $222,650,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $8,050,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $9,650,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. 
 The funds held in the trust account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below. 
 On May 18, 2021 and November 16, 2021, we completed the sale of total of 4,600,000 private placement warrants , 2,300,000 and 2,300,000, respectively, to our Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $4,600,000, to extend the period of time we will have to consummate our initial business combination by 12 months from the deadline of May 19, 2021 until May 19, 2022 (the “completion window”). The private placement warrants were identical to the private placement warrants sold to our Sponsor in connection with our initial public offering.
 As of December 31, 2021, there was $236,926,076 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes interest income available to us for franchise and income tax obligations of approximately $23,403, and $475,339 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2021, we have withdrawn $0 of interest earned from the trust account to pay taxes. 
 On December 21, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Embraer S.A., a Brazilian corporation (sociedade anônima) (“Embraer”), Embraer Aircraft Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Embraer (“EAH”), and EVE UAM, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of EAH (“Eve”) that was formed for purposes of conducting all activities by or on behalf of Embraer or its subsidiaries related to research, design, development, testing, engineering, licensing, certification, manufacturing, procurement, assembling, packaging, sales support and after-sales support of, marketing, promotion, advertising, qualification, distribution, importation, fulfillment, offering, sale, deployment delivery, provision, exploitation, configuration, installation, integration, analysis, support, maintenance, repair, service, and other commercialization of or provision of services with respect to Eve’s passenger or cargo aircrafts with hybrid/electric propulsion with vertical take-off and landing capabilities (“eVTOL”) and related products and services and the collection of systems and services (including organizations, airspace structures and procedures, environment and technologies) that support the integrated operation of UAM (as defined below) vehicles in low level airspace, which systems and services are directed to supporting UAM operations and enhancing the performance of UAM and low-level air travel, which for avoidance of doubt does not include general air traffic management systems (“UATM”) for the market of a system for commercial or non-commercial passenger or cargo air travel or transportation services, in each case, which involves an eVTOL vehicle and onboard/ground-piloted or autonomous piloting or operations (“UAM”) , in each case, excluding any of the following applications or uses whether or not in connection with eVTOL: crop dusting, defense or security businesses (the “UAM Business”).

  Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, a series of related transactions occurred, or will occur, including the following (the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement): (x) pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2021, by and among Embraer, EAH, and Eve, (i) Embraer transferred certain assets and liabilities relating to the UAM Business to Eve or to EVE Soluções de Mobilidade Aérea Urbana Ltda., a Brazilian limited liability company (sociedade limitada) and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Eve (the “Brazilian Subsidiary”), in exchange for the issuance of a number of limited liability company interests of Eve (the “Eve Interests”) as specified in the Contribution Agreement to Embraer (such issued Eve Interests, together with the Eve Interests that Embraer owned immediately prior to such issuance, together representing 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Eve at the time of such issuance, the “Transferred Eve Interests”), and (ii) Embraer then transferred the Transferred Eve Interests to EAH in exchange for the issuance of such number of shares of common stock and shares of non-voting preferred stock of EAH as set forth in the Contribution Agreement; (y) entered into a binding agreement with, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, sold and transferred to KPI Jet, LLC (the “Unaffiliated Investor”) such shares of non-voting preferred stock of EAH (the “Preferred Stock Sale”); and (z) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, EAH, as the sole beneficial and record holder of all of the Transferred Eve Interests (being all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Eve at such time), will contribute and transfer to Zanite, and Zanite will receive from EAH, all of the Transferred Eve Interests, as consideration and in exchange for the issuance and transfer by Zanite to EAH of 220,000,000 shares of common stock of Zanite, at the closing of our initial business combination. 
 The Business Combination Agreement provides that Eve’s, Embraer’s and EAH’s obligations to consummate our initial business combination are conditioned on, among other things, the Company having available cash of at least $350,000,000 from (i) the trust account (after deducting any amounts required to pay holders (“public stockholders”) who have elected to redeem their shares of Class A common stock included in the units sold by the Company in the initial public offering (the “public shares”) but prior to the payment of any transaction expenses or deferred compensation owed to the underwriters of the initial public offering) and (ii) the PIPE Investment (as defined below). Our initial business combination is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other closing conditions (including, without limitation, certain conditions precedent to the consummation of our initial business combination) as described in the preliminary proxy statement. If these conditions are not met, and such conditions are not waived, then the Business Combination Agreement could terminate and the proposed business combination may not be consummated. There can be no assurance that the parties to the Business Combination Agreement would waive any such provision of the Business Combination Agreement. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. 
 In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, we have entered into subscription agreements dated December 21, 2021 and December 24, 2021 (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors, including certain strategic investors, Sponsor and EAH (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”) pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of our initial business combination, an aggregate of 31,500,000 shares of Class A common stock of Zanite, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock” and, together with the “Class B common stock”, the “common stock”), at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $315,000,000, which includes the commitment of our Sponsor to purchase 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock for a purchase price of $25,000,000 and the commitment of EAH to purchase 17,500,000 shares of Class A common stock for a purchase price of $175,000,000 (collectively, the “PIPE Investment”). In connection with the PIPE Investment, EAH has entered into arrangements with certain of such Strategic PIPE Investors to provide them with price protections in the amount of up to their $30 million aggregate commitments in the form of credits for parts and services or cash in exchange for the transfer of their shares to EAH following the closing of our initial business combination. The obligations of each party to consummate the PIPE Investment are conditioned upon, among other things, customary closing conditions and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. 
 In addition, we have also entered into warrant agreements (collectively, the “Strategic Warrant Agreements”) with certain of the Strategic PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of each applicable warrant agreement, we have agreed to issue to the Strategic PIPE Investors warrants to purchase an aggregate amount of (i) 14,500,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.01 per share, (ii) 12,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $15.00 per share and (iii) 5,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Strategic Warrant Agreements provide for the issuance of such warrants upon the closing of our initial business combination and achievement of certain UAM Business milestones. In connection with the PIPE Investment, EAH has entered into arrangements with certain of such Strategic PIPE Investors to provide them with price protections in the amount of up to their $30 million aggregate commitments in the form of credits for parts and services or cash in exchange for the transfer of their shares to EAH following the closing of our initial business combination.

  On December 30, 2021, we filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC setting forth all of the above information and inviting the Zanite stockholders to attend the special meeting in lieu of the 2022 annual meeting of the stockholders (the “special meeting”) to approve, among other things, the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. 
 On February 3, 2022, the Sponsor issued another unsecured promissory note to the Company (the “New Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000. The New Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022 or (ii) the consummation of our initial business combination. The outstanding balance under the New Promissory Note is $0. 
 For more information regarding Eve, the Business Combination Agreement and our initial business combination, see the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus we filed on December 30, 2021. 
 Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of our initial business combination. 
 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the trust account, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of the Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 
 While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and manage a business in the Aviation, Aerospace & Defense, Urban Mobility and Emerging Technology industries that can benefit from our differentiated and proprietary deal flow, leading brand name and global network. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended on November 16, 2020, our “amended and restated certificate of incorporation”) prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. As described above, we have entered into the Business Combination Agreement. 
 Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders’ own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all the target businesses.

  In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or appraisal firm that our initial business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view. 
 Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is approximately $10.30 per public share as of December 31, 2021. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
 Submission of our initial business combination to a stockholder vote 
 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of our initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of our initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 
7 

  The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of our initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of our initial business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of the Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
 Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 
 We will have until May 19, 2022 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. 
Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess similar or greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

  Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers: Steven H. Rosen, Kenneth C. Ricci and Michael A. Rossi. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of our initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
