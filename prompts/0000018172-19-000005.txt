Company Overview
A.M. Castle & Co. (the "Company") is a global distributor of specialty metals and supply chain services, principally serving the producer durable equipment, commercial aircraft, heavy equipment, industrial goods, construction equipment, and retail sectors of the global economy. Its customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium- and smaller-sized firms spread across a variety of industries. Particular focus is placed on the aerospace and defense, power generation, mining, heavy industrial equipment, and general manufacturing industries, as well as general engineering applications. 
On August 31, 2017, the Company emerged from its chapter 11 cases and its Amended Prepackaged Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization became effective (the "Effective Date"). References to “Successor” refer to the Company on or after the Effective Date. References to “Predecessor” refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date.

The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. As of December 31, 2018, the Company operates out of 21 service centers located throughout North America (17), Europe (2) and Asia (2). The Company's service centers hold inventory and process and distribute products to both local and export markets.
Industry and Markets
Service centers act as supply chain intermediaries between primary producers, which deal in bulk quantities in order to achieve economies of scale, and end-users in a variety of industries that require specialized products in significantly smaller quantities and forms. Service centers also manage the differences in lead times that exist in the supply chain. While original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and other customers often demand delivery within hours, the lead time required by primary producers can be as long as several months. Service centers provide value to customers by

aggregating purchasing, providing warehousing and distribution services to meet specific customer needs, including demanding delivery times and precise metal specifications, and by providing value-added metals processing services.
The principal markets served by the Company are highly competitive. The Company is principally focused on two key markets, aerospace and industrial. Competition within these markets is based on service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability, timely delivery, ability to provide supply chain solutions and price. The Company competes in a highly fragmented industry. Competition in the various markets in which the Company participates comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which have greater financial resources and some of which have more established brand names in the local, regional and global markets served by the Company.
The Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to larger customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal.
In order to capture scale efficiencies and remain competitive, many primary metal producers are consolidating their operations and focusing on their core production activities. These producers have increasingly outsourced metals distribution, inventory management and value-added metals processing services to metals service centers. This process of outsourcing allows them to work with a relatively small number of intermediaries rather than many end customers. As a result, metals service centers, including the Company, are now providing a range of services for their customers, including metal purchasing, processing and supply chain solutions.
The Company’s marketing strategy focuses on distributing highly engineered specialty grades and alloys of metals as well as providing specialized processing services designed to meet very precise specifications. Core products include alloy and stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminum, titanium, and carbon. Inventories of these products assume many forms such as plate, sheet, extrusions, round bar, hexagon bar, square and flat bar, tubing and coil. Depending on the size of the facility and the nature of the markets it serves, the Company's service centers are equipped as needed with bar saws, plate saws, oxygen and plasma arc flame cutting machinery, trepanning machinery, boring machinery, honing equipment, water-jet cutting equipment, stress relieving and annealing furnaces, surface grinding equipment, CNC machinery and sheet shearing equipment. Various specialized fabrications are also performed for customers through pre-qualified subcontractors that thermally process, turn, polish, cut-to-length and straighten alloy and carbon bar. 
Procurement
The Company purchases metals from many producers. Material is purchased in large lots and stocked at its service centers until sold, usually in smaller quantities and typically with some value-added processing services performed. The Company’s ability to provide quick delivery of a wide variety of specialty metals products, along with its processing capabilities and supply chain management solutions, allows customers to lower their own inventory investment by reducing their need to order the large quantities required by producers and their need to perform additional material processing services. Some of the Company’s purchases are covered by long-term contracts and commitments, which generally have corresponding customer sales agreements.
Thousands of customers from a wide array of industries are serviced primarily through the Company’s own sales organization. Orders are primarily filled with materials shipped from Company stock. The materials required to fill the balance of sales are obtained from other sources, such as purchases from other distributors or direct mill shipments to customers. Deliveries are made principally by third party logistics providers using their fleets, which display Company-branding. Otherwise, common carrier delivery is used in areas not serviced directly by such third party logistics providers. The Company’s broad network of locations provides same or next-day delivery to most of their markets, and two-day delivery to substantially all of the remaining markets.
Customers
The Company’s customer base is well diversified and therefore, the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer, or a few customers. The customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium- and smaller-sized firms.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 979 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 135 were represented by the United Steelworkers of America under collective bargaining agreements. Effective May 15, 2018, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 106 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland, Ohio. Approximately 29 employees at our Hammond, Indiana facility are covered

by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1, 2016 and expires on August 31, 2020. The Company believes its relationships with its employees are good.
