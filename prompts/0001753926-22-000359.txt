Dividends will accumulate whether or not the Company has earnings or whether funds are legally available or declared by the Board, and no interest will be payable on any dividends which may be in arrears. Each share of RCPS shall be convertible into one share of common stock of the Company, upon the Board approving the initiation of the listing process to list the shares of the Company on any stock exchange, or upon the written approval of the Company. The Company may also, at its option, redeem the RCPS for cash at a redemption price of $1.00 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. Notwithstanding, all outstanding RCPS shall be redeemable by the Company on the second anniversary of the issuance date thereof.
 
To date no shares of RCPS have been issued.

The Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose the effective date of the Name Change and trading symbol change upon receipt of the notification from FINRA. The new CUSIP number for the Company’s Common Stock post-Reverse Stock Split is 92849Y 206.
 
Impact of Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
 
As many parts of the world is currently under lockdown or restrictive movement orders due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that all companies related to the travel, entertainment and lifestyle industry have been negatively impacted. Our Company is not spared either. We do not foresee any income contribution from this business until the destination areas (in particular South-East Asia and Europe) reopen their countries to allow foreign visitors again.
 
Our multi-level marketing (“MLM”) business is negatively impacted due to the fact that being a business built on fostering personal relationship and expanding new contacts, most distributors are unable to carry out the more important aspects of regular face to face visits and appointments, promotional events and direct coaching to continuously improve their team’s skills, motivation and knowledge of our products. Fortunately, we are still able to connect to our leaders via calls, emails and backoffice announcements and other form of online communication such as Skype and Zoom to keep the leaders and members abreast with our status and development. As such, our MLM operation is still ongoing amid slower than usual.
 
In the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed on March 30, 2021, we announced that the Malaysian government extended the Recovery Movement Control Order (“RMCO”) to last till December 31, 2020. Despite subsequently, the Malaysian Government extended RMCO to last until March 31,2021, due to the increasing infection of the pandemic, the Malaysian Government revised the Movement Control Order (“MCO) of each states in Malaysia for the period starting January 11,2021 till May 31, 2021. However, such control orders was insufficient to deal with the increasing infection, Malaysia has gone into total lockdown from June 1, 2021 until June 28, 2021. Thereafter, the Malaysian Government issue a National Recovery Plan, to cater for both the pandemic period and post-pandemic period. The National Recovery Plan, which basically spell out 4 different phases of control order, are still in effect until to date of this report; Phase 4 are no longer having all states under lockdown and that all business and social activities within the country are permitted to operate.
 
We hope that in the middle of 2022, there will be improvement towards the restriction caused by the pandemic, hence enabling more merchants to sign up with us, and that our members will be more encouraged and enthusiastic to promote our e-commerce website to their family, friends and prospects.

Our Company
 
HWGC Holdings Limited is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Nevada. Through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely Vitaxel and Vionmall incorporated under the laws of the Country of Malaysia, we run and operate the e-commerce business. Vitaxel was organized and commenced business operations in 2014 and Vionmall was organized and commenced business operations in 2015.
 
Vitaxel is a global direct selling, multi-level marketing company offering travel, entertainment, lifestyle and other products and services principally through electronic commerce commonly referred to as e-commerce.
 
Vionmall is involved in e-commerce business, through its platforms: Vionmarket, VTrips and VMall. Vionmarket is a rebate website that provide retail sales direct to consumers. However, Vionmarket do not develop or manufacture the products and services. VTrips is a platform that provides concessionary and travel packages to the public and members of Vitaxel. VMall is a newly launched e-commerce platform during current year first quarter.
 
We generate revenues through sales of our products on our e-commerce platforms. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $3,124 and $18,872, respectively, in revenues, of which Vitaxel accounted for 1% and Vionmall accounted for 99%, of our revenues. 
 
As a multi-level marketing company, a significant part of our platform involves recruiting members that sell our goods and services and that assist in recruiting other members. Our members can also promote and sell their own products and services through our Vionmall subsidiary.
 
Our operations, including sales transactions, are primarily based in Malaysia. We presently have approximately 5,700 members. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 62% of our members reside in Malaysia, 29% of our members reside in Singapore, 4% members reside in China, approximately 3% members reside in Hong Kong and approximately 2% members reside in other countries. We provide our members from time-to-time with training which includes prospecting and closing skills, plan orientation, back-office training, network management, personal and leadership development and team-building activities.
 
Unlike the traditional MLM business model where most of the business model concentrates on particular products and/or services, our business model allows our members to own a sub-domain through Vionmall where they can promote their own products and services (separate from our products and services).
 
We strive to differentiate ourselves through innovation in both our product and service offerings and our sales channels. Consumers can purchase our products and services either directly from our members or directly from our online platform. Our products and services are listed on our website and customers can easily purchase them online. Our members need not carry our products physically to their customers, they only need to promote our products through word of mouth or show prospective customers our list of products online through computers or smart-phones. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were primarily attributable to sales in VionMall.

Our Vitaxel packages include product points (which are exchangeable for tour and travel products or travel kits). Since we are relatively new to the market, our initial strategy has been to promote our brand awareness by encouraging more people to become members. In furtherance thereof, to date all membership fees have been waived. Persons that purchase our product packages will automatically become members.
 
We acquire the products and services which we offer and sell from third parties. Although, we initially intend to primarily offer and sell products related to travel, entertainment and lifestyle, we are not limited to those areas and may sell unrelated products and services as long as these products and services will benefit our members and customers in a manner consistent with our objectives and mission.
 
In addition to discounted prices, members can earn income from several sources. Members may earn income by selling our products and services and their own products and services. The allocation of proceeds from the sales of members’ products and services is similar to the allocation process for independent suppliers of products and services. Suppliers determine the minimum amount they wish to receive. The retail price to consumers is then negotiated between us and the supplier and we retain the difference as profit. In addition, members who sponsor other members may earn commissions and bonuses based upon their sponsored members’ performance. 
 
We intend to continue to engage team leaders within each country in Asia in which we offer and sell our products to lead and promote our products. Since we have already established our name in certain of the Asian counties, we will continue to expand in those countries by providing more benefits to the team leaders, more attractive products through our Vionmall’s portals, further training and motivation talks, better information technology structure and enhance support systems.
 
To become a member, a person must purchase a member package. Member packages include products and points that carry a value that approximates the package price. The packages do not come with a membership fees, which was originally proposed to be exempted for the first year from the date of purchase of the package and to be charged at certain rate commending from the first day of the second year, but are currently still waived for all members as of the date of this Annual Report. Each member package is available in English and Chinese and typically includes booklets describing us, our compensation plan and rules of member conduct, various training and promotional materials, member applications and a product and services catalog. The price of a member package varies by package type and provides a low-cost entry for incoming members.
 
The vacation business is seasonal as it depends on the holidays in the countries that the members reside.
 
History
 
Our publicly traded parent company was incorporated as Albero, Corp. in Nevada on November 19, 2013. Prior to the Share Exchange and Split-Off (each as defined below), we were engaged in the horse breading business. This business however was spun off contemporaneous with our acquisition of Vitaxel and Vionmall.
 
On January 8, 2016, (i) we changed our name to Vitaxel Group Limited, and (ii) we increased our authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, to 7,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.000001 (the “Common Stock”), and 100,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.000001.
 
On January 18, 2016, we completed a share exchange (the “Share Exchange”) under a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) of the same date among us, Vitaxel SDN BHD, a Malaysian corporation (“Vitaxel”), the shareholders of Vitaxel, Vitaxel Online Mall SBN BHD, a Malaysian corporation (“Vionmall”) and the shareholders of Vionmall pursuant to which Vitaxel and Vionmall each became wholly owned subsidiaries of ours. In the Share Exchange, all of the outstanding shares of Vitaxel and Vionmall were converted into shares of our Common Stock, resulting in those operating companies becoming our wholly owned subsidiaries.

In connection with the Share Exchange and pursuant to a Split-Off Agreement (defined below), we transferred our pre-Share Exchange assets and liabilities to our pre-Share Exchange majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender by him and cancellation of 3,000,000 shares of our Common Stock.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Share Exchange business and acquired the businesses of Vitaxel and Vionmall, and will continue the existing business operations of Vitaxel and Vionmall as a publicly-traded company under the name Vitaxel Group Limited.
 
On May 25, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized and approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which authorized a one hundred-to-one reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.000001 per share, with a record date of June 12, 2017 (the “Record Date”). 
 
On May 30, 2017, the Board of Directors of Vitaxel authorized and approved a related increase in the par value of the Vitaxel common stock from $0.000001 to $0.0001.
 
On June 12, 2017, we effectuated a 1:100 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) whereby our authorized shares of capital stock was reduced in proportion to the Reverse Split ratio. Accordingly, our 7,000,000,000 shares of authorized common stock became 70,000,000 shares of authorized common stock and our 100,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock became 1,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock. Additionally, as part of the Reverse Split, the par value of both our common stock and our preferred stock was proportionately increased from $0.000001 per share to $0.0001 per share, as reflected in the Certificate of Amendment. Under Nevada law, the Reverse Split and corresponding reduction in authorized common stock and preferred stock, and increase in par value of both classes of our stock, did not require shareholder approval.
 
On June 13, 2017 we received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to effectuate the Reverse Split at the open of business on June 15, 2017. When the reverse stock split became effective, every one hundred shares of our pre-split issued and outstanding common stock, par value 0.000001 per share, automatically converted into one post-split share of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, rounded up to the nearest share, and with a corresponding reduction of the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue and increase in par value. The new CUSIP number for our common stock following effectiveness of the reverse stock split was 92849Y206.
 
On March 2, 2022, the Company filed an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which (i) changed the name of the Company (the “Name Change”) from “Vitaxel Group Limited” to “HWGC Holdings Limited” (ii) reduced the number of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) by effecting a reverse stock split in the split ratio of 1-for-10 (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and (iii) increased the authorized share capital of the Company from 71,000,000 shares, consisting of 70,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Preferred Stock”), to 425,000,000, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
 
In connection with the Name Change and Reverse Stock Split, the Company submitted to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) a voluntary request for a change of the Company’s trading symbol. The Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split will become effective for trading purposes when approval of said corporate actions is approved by FINRA. The Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose the effective date of the Name Change and trading symbol change upon receipt of the notification from FINRA. The new CUSIP number for the Company’s Common Stock post-Reverse Stock Split is 92849Y 206.
 
On March 10, 2022, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation of the Relative Rights and Preferences of The Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock of HWGC Holdings Limited (the “Certificate of Designation”). Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the creation 25,000,000 shares of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “RCPS”). The RCPS is ranked senior to all classes or series of the Company’s common stock and does not have any voting rights. However, the holders of the RCPS are entitled to receive, when declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6% per annum on each $1.00 per RCPS. Commencing on the date of issuance, the dividends on the RCPS shall accrue and be cumulative, payable annually in arrears on the 30th business day on each anniversary of the issue date. Dividends will accumulate whether or not the Company has earnings or whether funds are legally available or declared by the Board, and no interest will be payable on any dividends which may be in arrears. Each share of RCPS shall be convertible into one share of common stock of the Company, upon the Board approving the initiation of the listing process to list the shares of the Company on any stock exchange, or upon the written approval of the Company. The Company may also, at its option, redeem the RCPS for cash at a redemption price of $1.00 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. Notwithstanding, all outstanding RCPS shall be redeemable by the Company on the second anniversary of the issuance date thereof.
 
To date no shares of RCPS have been issued.
 
Competition
 
The goods and services we sell that are most vulnerable to competition are those categories that relate to travel, entertainment and lifestyle products and services. These services are available through many channels including those of direct selling and the Internet. We try to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our member focus on the consultative and educational nature of the sales process and the contact that our members have with their customers.
 
We are subject to competition for the recruitment of members from other network marketing organizations, including those that market similar products and services as well as other types of products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on having relevant products that meet consumer needs, a rewarding compensation plan, and a financially viable company.
 
Management believes that the direct selling channel is an effective way to sell our products and services. We believe that the direct-selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products and services because demand for travel, entertainment and lifestyle products and services is strengthened by ongoing personal contact and education between members and their customers. In addition, our members consume our products and services themselves, and therefore can provide first-hand testimonials about our products and services, which can serve as a powerful sales tool.

We believe our business model enables us to grow our business with moderate investment in our infrastructure and fixed costs. We incur no direct incremental cost to add a new member in our existing markets or add additional products and services to our product and service mix, and our member compensation varies directly with sales. Furthermore, we can readily increase production and distribution of our products and services as a result of having access to numerous third-party relationships.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
Many countries have either implemented new laws or, made revisions to existing laws on direct selling and multilevel marketing in the last decade. Both developed and developing economies have realized the potential of the direct selling industry in light of the positive socio-economic impact of this sector – both directly and indirectly.
 
Along with the primary objective of regulating various fraudulent schemes, these countries have also enacted specific legislation largely self-monitored by local associations. Globally, these regulations relating to direct selling industry vary from country to country. Certain countries, including Malaysia, have enacted specific anti-pyramid laws to deal with frauds and abusive schemes, however, through specific regulations, they distinguish permissible multi-level marketing (“MLM”) operations by direct selling companies. On the other hand, some countries primarily focus on consumer protection and strive to identify fraudulent schemes.
 
The substantive provisions governing direct selling businesses in various countries are founded on similar principles such as drafting a precise definition of direct selling business, pre-licensing of direct selling company, registration of direct sellers, stipulations governing activities and rewards/bonuses received by direct sellers, bans on entry fees, extensive buy-back policies and related matters.
 
In addition, the direct sales/MLM industry has some level of self-regulation and standards established by recognized trade organizations. The direct selling industry self –regulates itself to maintain high levels of probity, integrity, corporate governance and consumer protection standards. Multiple direct selling companies from across the world have also joined forces to form direct selling associations which promote ethical business practices and prescribe a detailed code of ethics for the members, its sales representatives and customers. The code of conduct is a self –regulatory standard which regulates the varying interactions across the spectrum of direct sales that often exceeds local legal requirements.
 
The World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (“WFDSA”) is a non-governmental, voluntary organization globally representing the direct selling industry as a Federation of 60 national Direct Selling Associations (“DSA’s”) and one regional DSA – Federation of European DSA (Seldia). The “World Selling Code of Conduct” (the “DSA Code”) was published by the WFDSA for National DSA members. This DSA Code establishes a standard framework for interaction between direct selling member companies, their direct sellers and consumers. The DSA Code is a constantly evolving cornerstone of the direct selling industry’s commitment to ethical business practices and customer service. It is a mechanism that helps ensure that independent salespeople and customers are treated fairly and respectfully.
 
 10

 

In order for a DSA to become a member of WFDSA, it must adopt the minimum standards set forth by the Code to the extent the requirements are consistent with the law in each particular country. These Code of Ethics are enforced by an independent code administrator who is not connected with any member company. As a condition to membership in the DSA, all member companies agree to honor the administrator’s decisions. Broadly, the Code seeks to capture various aspects of a direct selling business which need to be regulated including use of misleading testimonials, misrepresentation of actual or potential earning claims or use of any exploitative and deceptive recruitment practices.
 
The Code has been classified into three sections containing regulations in respect of:
 

● | Conduct for the Protection of Consumers 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Conduct Between Companies and Direct Sellers 
● | Conduct Between Companies. 

 
Further, to help ensure legal compliance, the Code provides that new memberships should not be subject to significant monetary commitment either by way of entrance fees, training fees, purchases of sales kits or inventory loading. The companies take responsibility for consumer protection through provision of accurate information, product warranty and buyback offer. It ensures that member companies implement adequate mechanisms to address customer complaints with respect to their products and/or its sales representatives.
 
The Code is a self-regulation and not a law, therefore, does not restate all legal obligations. Compliance with local laws pertaining to direct selling by National DSA’s is a condition of acceptance by or continuance of membership in DSA. The Code also has a provision for an extra-territorial effect wherein every national DSA pledges that it will require each member to comply with the WFDSA World Codes of Conduct for Direct Selling with regard to direct selling activities outside of its home country, unless those activities are under the jurisdiction of Codes of Conduct of another country’s DSA to which the member also belongs.
 
Malaysia is a member of the WFDSA and has drafted a standard code of ethics for companies engaged in direct selling activities. 
 
While the Company does not necessarily “commit” to the worldwide industry standards it does endeavor to maintain those standards as a minimum. 
 
Regulations in Malaysia
 
The rise of the number of direct selling companies in Malaysia was accompanied by the rise of fraudulent activities such as pyramid and Ponzi schemes. In 2011, Malaysia amended its previously existing statute to rename it the Direct Sales and Anti-Pyramid Scheme Act (the “DSAPSA”). The key objectives of DSAPSA were to incorporate specific provisions governing sales achieved through electronic medium and regulations on legitimate multilevel marketing.
 
The DSAPSA provides for:
 

● | Licensing of direct sales activities for the protection of the consumer’s rights and interest; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promotion and regulation of the growth and development of ethical direct sales activities; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 11

 


● | Prohibition of all activities involving pyramid schemes, chain distribution schemes or other similar schemes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All door-to door sales and mail order selling (including selling by telephone) in Malaysia are subject to the DSAPSA which sets forth the conditions under which business may be conducted, defines requirements of direct sales contracts, identifies conditions under which licenses may not be granted or revoked and the punishment for fraud. The DSAPSA also provides for a cooling-off period of 10 days after the date of making a direct sales contract. The regulating authority is the ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs.
 
The DSAPSA also stipulates that any person negotiating a door-to door sale will have to produce an identification card and authority card. This protects consumers from fraudulent schemes. In Malaysia, direct sellers are treated as independent contractors. The following types of marketing plans are presently covered under the provisions of the DSAPSA:
 

● | Door-to-door sales (Multilevel marketing plan/ Single marketing plan) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mail Order sales
--+-----------------


● | Sales through electronic transactions.
--+---------------------------------------

 
There is no prohibition on the sales of specific products. However, direct selling companies wanting to introduce new products must seek prior approval from the relevant authority before distributing the products. Also, all health products must be registered with the Drug Control Authority, Ministry of Health, before they can be sold through this mode. The Company is not involved in either door-to-door sales or mail order sales.  
 
The Direct Selling Association of Malaysia (“DSAM”)
 
The DSAM functions at the societal level to create and maintain an environment that is conductive to the growth and stability of the direct selling industry in Malaysia. Established in 1978 as a national trade association, it is led by a President and Vice-President and 7 committee members, all of whom are elected by member companies. In addition to the cooperation extended by member companies, the DSAM works closely with the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives & Consumerism, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, other government bodies and trade associations to achieve common goals. The DSAM Code of Conduct is an example of self-regulation. It is a strict and effective code of conduct implemented worldwide, and endorsed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives& Consumerism.
Research and Development Activities
 
Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date.
