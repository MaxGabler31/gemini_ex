Item 1. Business
 
We have been engaged in the business of developing and marketing products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle since 2017. Our initial business plan was to build a family waterpark in a state-of-the-art designed aquatic center in several locations throughout the Hawaiian Islands. We were not able to develop this business and we did not generate any revenues in this business. Following a change of control on January 30, 2017, resulting from the sale by the then principal stockholder of 36,000,000 shares of common stock, constituting all of his stock and 76.3% of the then outstanding common stock, we discontinued our efforts to develop aquatic centers. Our business to date has involved purchase products from two suppliers and selling these products to two unrelated customers.
 
Our first sale was made in September 2017. All of our sales to date have been sales of cordyceps related products and, commencing in the second quarter of the year ended September 30, 2018, metallothionein MT-3 elizer. We may also seek to market other products which we see as complimentary to our present products.
 
Cordyceps is a fungus that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis has been described as a medicine in old Chinese medical books and Tibetan medicine. It is a rare combination of a caterpillar and a fungus and found at altitudes above 4500m in Sikkim. According to the Journal of Ayuveda and Integrative Medicine, the fungus is parasitic in nature. The base of the mushroom first originates from an insect larval host and ends at the club-like cap, including the stipe and stroma. The fruit body is dark brown to black, and the root of organism, the larval body pervaded by the mycelium, is yellowish to brown color. The immature larvae (host) on which cordyceps grows usually lies about 6 inches below the surface of the ground. As the fungus approaches maturity, it consumes more than 90% of the infected insect effectively mummifying its host. Local folk practitioners use the product alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs to treat various diseases. However, the effectiveness of Cordyceps sinensis, either alone or with other medicinal herbs, has not been shown as effective in double blind tests, and it has not been subject to the type of testing that would be required for prescription medication. As a result, in the United States we cannot make any claims as to specific health benefits.
 
Metallothionein MT-3 elizer is a protein that, in powder form, is used in health supplements. The encoded protein in metallothionein MT-3 is a growth inhibitory factor, and reduced levels of the protein are observed in the brains of individuals with some metal-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.
 
We first sold products during the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2017. In the year ended September 30, 2017, we generated revenues of $510,000 during the fourth quarter from the sale of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder one customer, and all of our purchases were from one supplier. During the year ended September 30, 2018, we sold Cordycepin and cordyceps powder and metallothionein MT-3 elizer to two customers. We purchased all of our Cordycepin and cordyceps powder from one supplier and all of our metallothionein MT-3 elizer from a second supplier. Our sales are sales of our product in bulk to companies who use our products as ingredients in their products. We do not sell products in a form for use by consumers although we may, in the future, develop products for use by consumers.

Our address is 12175 Visionary Way, Suite 1160, Fishers, Indiana 46038, telephone (317) 286-6788. Our corporate website is http://acrobiomedicalco.com. Information on or derived from our website or any other website is not part of this annual report.
Stock Distribution
 
On May 18, 2017, we effected a three-for-one stock distribution pursuant to which we issued two shares of common stock for each share of common stock outstanding on the record date, May 18, 2017. All share and per share information in this annual report retroactively reflect this stock distribution.
Source of Supply
 
We purchased all of our Cordycepin and cordyceps powder from one supplier, Aublog Inc., a Taiwan-based company, and we purchase all of our metallothionein MT-3 elizer from Taiwan Master Foods Co., Ltd., a Taiwan-based company. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with either supplier, as a result of which our suppliers have no obligation to sell products to us. The following table sets forth our purchases from these suppliers for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------------------------+--------------------------+----------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Aublog Inc. | $ | 5,827,700 | | $ | 459,000
Taiwan Master Foods Co. Ltd. | | 2,500,000 | | | - 
 | $ | 8,327,700 | | $ | 459,000

 
Our inventory at September 30, 2018 of $1,146,600 consisted of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder which we purchased from Aublog.
 
We do not plan to establish manufacturing facilities. We have engaged in initial discussions with potential contract manufacturers in Taiwan. If we can negotiate acceptable terms for a contract manufacturer to manufacture our products, we would source the raw materials and have the raw materials shipped to the manufacturer who would them customize the product to meet our specifications. However, the product may bear the brand names of the manufacturer rather than our brand name. If we are not able to negotiate an agreement with a contract manufacturer, we may continue to buy finished products from a manufacturer, which we anticipate would have the manufacturer’s brand names. Even if we engage a contract manufacturer, we may still buy a manufacturer’s brand products either from our contract manufacturer or another supplier. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary relationships with suppliers or contract manufacturers on reasonable terms.

All of our marketing and sales activities have been conducted by our chief executive officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who is our only employee and who provides his services on a part-time basis. All sales to date were made by our chief executive officer.

Government Regulations
 
In the event that we seek to market and sell our products in the United States, we will be subject to various laws and regulations. The United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a dietary ingredient as a vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, amino acid, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases, which means that supplements cannot make claims as to health benefits. Claims like these can only legitimately be made for drugs, not dietary supplements. Dietary supplements include such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes. Dietary supplements are marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, powders, and liquids. Cordyseps is considered a dietary supplement.
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering “conventional” foods and drug products. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, (i) manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. That means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and FDA regulations. The FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market.
 
The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. However, the reporting of an event is not an admission that the product caused the adverse event.
 
If we engage in business in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of other regulations, including those relating to health, safety, bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and environmental. These regulations may require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will able to be in compliance.
 
We do not sell products for retail sale to consumers although we may, in the future, develop products which are designed and packaged for consumer use. Our customers purchase our products in bulk and use our products as ingredients in their products. Countries into which our products are sold have regulations relating to the marketing, labeling and claims for dietary supplements. Since we do not sell products in form for use by consumers, our customers must comply with applicable government regulations. Our present customers are located in Hong Kong, which has laws concerning the ingredients in products sold for consumption, including the purity of the ingredients. If products which include our products as ingredients are sold in Hong Kong or any other country, the products may be subject to the food and supplement regulations of the country. We do not make any of the products we sell. To the extent a claim arises either as a result of the use by a consumer of products which contain our ingredients or a government agency raises questions about the purity of ingredients purchased from us, we may incur liability for any adverse reactions to the products purchased by consumers or failures of our products to conform to the stated purity of our products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to claim over against our supplier. If we sell products that are designed and packaged for use by consumers, we may be subject to laws relating to such products, including the purity and labeling of the products and any other regulations that may be applicable.
 
Research and Development
 
We plan to conduct research and development with respect to our own proprietary products. Our research and development activities may relate to cordyceps products to be sold in the United States. However, to date we have not commenced research and development operations with respect to any products, and we cannot assure you that we commence such activities in the near future, if at all, or that we will be able to develop proprietary products. We may engage third parties to perform the research and development, and the third parties may be related to our chief executive officer.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
We do not have any patent or other intellectual property rights with respect to any products.
 
Competition
 
A number of companies market and sell cordyceps products in the United States, including Real Mushrooms, Bulk Supplements, Terrasoul SuperFoods; Mental Refreshment Nutrition, NOW Foods, Aloha Medicinals, Natures Elements and Swanson Premium. These products include cordyceps extract as well as products that include cordyceps along with other ingredients. Many, if not all, of these companies are better known and better capitalized than we are, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other existing suppliers of cordyceps.
Employees
 
We have one employee, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who works for us on a part-time basis.
