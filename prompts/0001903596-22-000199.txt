Overview
--------

 
Kaya Holdings is a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise that produces, distributes, and/or sells a full range of premium cannabis products including flower, oils, vape cartridges and cannabis infused confections, baked goods and beverages through a fully integrated group of subsidiaries and companies supporting highly distinctive brands.


KAYS is a veteran of the global legal cannabis industry, with more than six years of operational experience. KAYS is the first U.S. publicly traded company to operate a legal marijuana dispensary, as well as the first to vertically integrate by adding cultivation and manufacturing.
 
The Company’s business strategy seeks to achieve four fundamental objectives:
 

· | maintaining direct access to customers (to own the relationship with end-users); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | effecting vertical integration to control the supply chain (to control cost, selection and quality); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | introducing strong brands in tradition and innovative categories (to control asset development); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creating the capacity to expand nationally and internationally as regulations and opportunities permit. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Kaya Holdings currently operates three majority-owned subsidiaries, each responding to various demands and opportunities in the cannabis industry, to aid in the execution of these objectives:
 
Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc.
 
 Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc. (“MJAI”), incorporated in 2014, operates the Company’s U.S. based cannabis operations including its Kaya Shack™ retail brand and the Kaya Farms™ cultivation brand.
 
After an evaluation of several factors including reputation for cannabis excellence, costs of entry, learning opportunity, and ease of regulatory structure, the Company selected Oregon as its point-of-entry into the legal cannabis sector where it commenced operations in Oregon in July 2014. Oregon is universally recognized for its excellence in cannabis cultivation and is part of the famed “Green Triangle” of expert cannabis cultivation that also includes Northern California. Having Oregon as the Company’s learning ground has allowed the Company to combine “traditional” methods of cannabis cultivation with modern agriculture techniques.
 
The Company’s US operations are currently focused in Oregon, where all of the Company’s operations are licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (the “OLCC’), which has jurisdiction over legal medical and recreational cannabis grow, production and retail operations. The Company has two active OLCC Marijuana Retailer Licenses, each of which allow for one brick-and-mortar physical dispensary location as well as unlimited delivery operations tied to the geographic location of the fixed based licensed operations. KAYS currently operates two Kaya Shack™ retail outlets (one in South Salem and one in Portland).
 
The Company has developed its own proprietary Kaya Farms™ strains of cannabis, which it has grown and produced at the various medical and recreational grows that the Company has operated and maintained over the past seven years in Oregon.
 The Company owns a 26-acre farm in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon, on which it is in process of constructing an 85,000-square foot Kaya Farms™ Greenhouse Grow and Production Facility. The Company has received county zoning approvals for the complex, and has been notified by the OLCC that they are ready to proceed with KAYS Production (Grow) Licensing for the Linn County Facility pending completion of initial construction.

Kaya Brands USA
 
Kaya Brands USA, Inc. (“KBUS”) is being incorporated to manage and leverage the intellectual property associated with the Kaya family of brands and seek out US based projects and ventures to enhance stockholder value associated with their development.
 
KBUS presently manages 18 proprietary brands formulated and developed by the Company which includes the Kaya Shack™ retail brand, the Kaya Farms™ cultivation brand, and the Kaya Gear™ apparel brand, as well as a host of carefully developed cannabis and CBD products that include cannabis extracts and concentrates, vape cartridges, chocolates, gummies and chews, topicals and creams, beverages, foods, and cannaceuticals.
 

Kaya Brands International and International Plans for Expansion
 
Kaya has implemented a strategic shift away from the U.S. cannabis market, its initial intended focus, placing current expansion emphasis on international opportunities and brand extensions. While the US Cannabis markets initially received a strong tail wind from the 2021 change in administration and the fact that US Cannabis Banking and Taxation Laws and Regulations are forecast to become more industry friendly, KAYS believes that it will still be some years until such time that the Federal Laws allow for Interstate Cannabis Commerce and true economies of scale to develop within the emerging U.S. Cannabis Markets. Thus, KAYS has developed an exciting international growth program with the potential for strategic position and growth, all the while remaining prepared for the eventuality of a more inviting U.S. market.
 
Kaya Brands International, Inc. (“KBI”) was incorporated in late 2019 to serve as the Company’s vehicle for expansion into worldwide cannabis markets. KBI is seeking to leverage the other product brands for development of the Kaya Shack™ retail and Kaya Farms™ brands in Europe and elsewhere as opportunities permit. Projects currently under development include licensing of the Kaya Farms™ brand to develop cultivation projects in Greece, Israel and other potential locations.
 
This segregation of US and foreign based activities would allow for KAYS to eventually have KBI listed on a recognized securities exchange such as the OTCQX, NASDAQ or NYSE in the US, the Canadian Securities Exchange or “CSE” in Canada (a Canadian Exchange that has proven to be an excellent source of new institutional and retail investment capital and liquidity for both Canadian and U.S.-based OTC cannabis stocks) or other such international exchange that would allow KBI to access additional capital not currently available through US over-the counter (“OTC”) markets.
 
KAYS intends to maintain a majority ownership of KBI, but is also working on plans to issue a dividend of common stock in KBI to stockholders of record at a date to be determined by the Board of Directors of KAYS.
 
Additionally, KAYS intends to structure KBI’s participation in projects that would lead to these projects eventually seeking their own public company status and corresponding issuance of securities which could potentially significantly enhance the value of KAYS/KBI’s investment and possibly lead to dividends for KAYS/KBI’s stockholders. There can be no assurance given as to whether or when KAYS will be able to do so, or it would ultimately be successful in increasing stockholder value. 
 
Recent Developments
 
Kaya Farms Greece
 
On January 11, 2021, KAYS/KBI, through a majority owned subsidiary of KBI (Kaya Farms Greece or “KFG") and Greekkannabis (“GKC", an Athens based Cannabis Company that is licensed to build ) executed an agreement for
 
On January 11, 2021, KAYS/KBI, through a majority owned subsidiary of KBI (Kaya Farms Greece or “KFG") and Greekkannabis (“GKC", an Athens based Cannabis Company that is licensed to build ) executed an agreement for KBI to acquire 50% of GKC. The first 25% was acquired in January, 2021 and the remaining 25% was acquired in July, 2021.
 
GKC’s projects include two medical cannabis cultivation and processing projects in Greece- one in Epidaurus, Greece and the other in Thebes, Greece.


The Epidaurus Project consists of 2 connected industrial buildings (already constructed, approximately 50,000 square feet in total under-air space) situated on 2.8 acres of land, with its own independent industrial electrical power center and ample water supply to service the needs of the facility. The Epidaurus Project will include 25,000 square feet of indoor cannabis cultivation, a 15,000 square foot EU-GMP extraction and processing facility, and a 10,000 square foot EU-GMP packing area. There is ample room for expansion with room to construct an additional 15,000 square feet on site. The joint venture is awaiting project financing and final license approval from Greek government authorities.
 
The Epidaurus Project is smaller in scale than the Company's 15-acre project in Thebes, Greece, allowing KAYS to fast-track cultivation and processing of its proprietary branded cannabis products for distribution in legal EU markets while awaiting greater legal cannabis demand to emerge prior to developing a large-scale capacity in Thebes.
 
The Thebes Project has a development license from the Greek authorities and a purchase option on 15 acres in Thebes, Greece. The farm has large-scale cultivation capacities and the company expects to develop the site once legal cannabis demand warrants an increase in capacity.

Kaya Farms Israel
 

On March 30, 2021 the Company confirmed that its Israeli subsidiary, Kaya Shalvah has been awarded its initial permit from the "YAKAR", the Department for Medical Cannabis in the Israeli Ministry of Health, to develop an Israeli cannabis cultivation and processing facility. This initial permit grants Kaya Shalvah permission to proceed with its plans to develop commercial scale cannabis cultivation and processing in Israel.
 
We have chosen to become active in the Israeli cannabis market because of this position as global center of cannabis science, where technologies are specifically developed to enhance cannabis cultivation processes and yields, and innovative consumer products are emerging that have potential interest for both the medical and recreational markets throughout the world.
 

Kaya Shalvah is currently focused on two separate paths of development to launch its Israel Operations- the first being through participation in the government sponsored Greenegev Cannabis Ecosystem in Yerucham, Israel and the second path being through potentially acquiring an interest in currently licensed medical cannabis production and processing facilities that are already operating in Israel.


In July 2021, KAYS concluded a settlement with Sunstone Capital Partners, LLC, Sunstone Marketing Partners LLC and Bruce Burwick, the principal of Sunstone and a director of Kays, regarding the failure to deliver to KAYS the Oregon Cannabis Production and Processing Licenses that were part of a warehouse purchase transaction in August 2018.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, Bruce Burwick surrendered to KAYS 1,006,671 shares of our common stock issued to him in connection with the transaction (800,003 shares which were issued for the facility purchase, 166,667 shares which were issued for $250,000 in cash and 40,001 shares which were issued as annual compensation for Burwick serving as a director of KAYS). The shares have been cancelled. In addition, the Company received clear title to the warehouse facility. As part of the settlement, Burwick received $160,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the facility’s grow license to an unrelated third party, resigned from the Company’s board of directors and agreed to work as a non-exclusive consultant to the Company for the next four years for a yearly fee of $35,000.00
 In October 2021, KAYS sold the Eugene, Oregon cannabis facility for gross proceeds of $1,325,000. The funds received from the sale have been and are being used to repay certain debt and strengthen its balance sheet, as well as providing the initial stage capital for some of the Company’s U.S. and global expansion activities, including its cultivation sites in Greece and Israel.

The Global Cannabis Industry
 
The global cannabis market is being driven by the increasing number of countries passing legislation to decriminalize the use of cannabis and legalize cannabis for medicinal use. This change in legislation is the result of an increase in public awareness to the medicinal benefits of cannabis and greater social acceptance of cannabis use.
 According to New Frontier Data, more than 260 million adults globally consumed cannabis at least once annually in 2018 – placing global spending on cannabis (legal & illicit) at $344 billion USD annually.
 The Insight Partners, another research group, in their 2019 Global Cannabis Market report projects the global cannabis market to reach $153,689,900,000 in 2027, which represents a CAGR of 34% from 2019-2027.
 Prohibition Partners, expects the North American market to remain the world’s largest until 2023, when they expect North American ($17.7 billion) to outpace Europe ($16.8 billion). By 2024, with a forecasted global market of $103.9 billion, Europe is expected to outperform North America $39.1 billion to $37.9 billion.
 Of the $103.9 billion global cannabis market forecasted by Prohibition Partners, $62.7 billion is expected to be medical cannabis driven. Of this $62.7 billion, Europe is expected to be the largest market, with $22.3 billion, followed by North America with $20.2 billion. 
 
North America
 North America, according to New Frontier Data, represents a total cannabis demand (legal & illicit) valued at $86 billion USD.
 The United States and Canada have been leading the global legal cannabis movement, which in turn impacts the way governments worldwide are structuring the regulation of legal cannabis in their own countries.
Canada
 Canada legalized medical cannabis in 2001 and in October 2017 the Federal Cannabis Act came into effect, making Canada the first G7 nation to legalize recreational cannabis. The legal structure has given rise to large Canadian cannabis companies that have achieved high valuations, which they have leveraged to purchase supply chain companies and invest in overseas infrastructure projects to produce cannabis at costs lower than those in Canada. Increasing competition from U.S. and European countries and investor frustration has seen some decline of valuation and some Canadian companies have been forced to shrink operations and lessen their developing global footprint.
 Canadian cannabis companies currently export to more than twenty countries. Up until 2020, most exports of cannabis from Canada had been sent to European Countries. Exports of oil and flowers from Canada to Europe increased from 2019-2020 by 28% in terms of weight, but have declined, with most flowers being exported to Israel and the majority of oil being exported to Australia.
 The United States
 
The United States has been the global leader in cannabis innovation; including new genetics, cultivation techniques, derivative products, and delivery methods.
 Cannabis remains federally illegal in the United States, with the interstate transport and sale of cannabis prohibited. Nonetheless, support for legal recreational cannabis remains above 60% in most reputable polls, and 48 U.S. states have some form of legal medical or recreational cannabis (including hemp/CBD). Only Idaho and Nebraska prohibit all forms of cannabinoids.
 States with some type of legal medical cannabis includes Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
 States permitted the sales of recreational, or “adult-use” cannabis are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. The District of Colombia (Washington D.C.) also permits adult-use cannabis.
 Despite the number of individual states permitting the cultivation and distribution of cannabis (including hemp), in 2021 the U.S. Senate failed to pass a bill that would reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, which would have allowed cannabis companies access to banking and relief from punitive IRS rules.

Europe
  Some key points about the European medical cannabis market are:
 

§ | New Frontier Data estimates the European cannabis market (legal & illicit) generates $69 billion USD annually.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Prohibition Partners Europe forecasts Europe to be the largest legal cannabis market worldwide by 2024, with a total value of $39.1 billion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | The Insight Partners estimates the European cannabis market will be worth $474 million by the end of 2021. They estimate the market to grow with a CAGR of 67.4% from 2021 to reach $3.75 billion by 2025.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Europe is projected to surpass North America (currently the largest medical cannabis market) in 2024, with a market value of $39.1 billion to North America’s $37.9 billion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | In Europe Germany continues to be largest and fastest growing medical cannabis market. Sales of insurance covered cannabis grew to 67% in 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Total European market sales, including isolated cannabinoids, finished pharmaceutical products, cannabis flower and full spectrum cannabis products exceeded $295 million in 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Germany has by far the largest number of medical cannabis patients as of 2021. By 2025, it is expected that countries like France and the United Kingdom will have developed their patient access considerably, growing to represent a significant share of the European market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Israel and Greece
 In June 2017, the Greek government announced it would be legalizing medical cannabis, and less than a year later Greek leaders approved Law 4523 and Joint Ministerial Decision No. 51483, which permitted farming and production of medical cannabis. In 2020 the Greek Parliament passed legislation that further relaxed cannabis export regulations, now permitting the bulk export of cannabis flower.
 Israel is currently the largest importer of medical cannabis in the world. By June 2020 Israel had imported more than six tonnes of cannabis. The strong medical cannabis program stems from traditionally progressive cannabis policies and strong cultural acceptance of cannabis medicinal uses.
 The Israeli cannabis sector has been slowed by regulations, which have hindered Israeli cannabis exports and complicated domestic distribution. There is currently no mutual recognition agreement between local Medical Cannabis GMP and EU-GMP, denying many Israeli firms the qualifications necessary to export to Europe.
 In February 2021, Israeli cannabis company Panaxia was chosen to supply medical cannabis to Cyprus and France as part of new government programs. IM Cannabis exports cannabis to Germany by purchasing EU-GMP flower and selling the product to German wholesalers.

The Kaya Shack™ Brand
 

Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Shack™ brand of legal medical and recreational retail marijuana retail stores. Kaya Holdings operates two recreational marijuana retail outlets and medical marijuana dispensaries in Oregon under the Kaya Shack™ brand.
 
Dubbed by the mainstream press as the “Starbucks of Marijuana” after our first outlet opened in July 2014, our operating concept is simple: to deliver a consistent customer experience (quality products, fair prices and superior customer service) to a broad and diverse base of customers. Kaya Shack™ meets the quality needs of the “marijuana enthusiast”, the comfort and atmosphere of all including “soccer moms” and the price sensitivities of casual smokers.
 
The Kaya Shack™ brand communicates positive thinking and joy, with signs adorning the walls that read “It’s a Good Day to have a Good Day,” “Some of our Happiest Days Haven’t Even Happened Yet,” and our signature “Be Kind.”
 
Kaya Shack™ retail outlets are open 7 days a week- Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm, and Sunday 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Operations follow an operational manual that details procedures for 18 areas of operation including safety, compliance, store opening, store closing, merchandising, handling of cash, inventory control, product intake, store appearance and employee conduct.
 
In compliance with regulations, all marijuana and marijuana infused products sold through our stores are quality tested by independent labs to assure adherence to strict quality and OLCC regulations.
 
The Company is exploring opportunities to expand its operations beyond Oregon by replicating its Kaya Shack™ brand retail outlets through franchising in other states where medial and or recreational cannabis use is legal or expected to become legal in the near term, as well as in Canada, Greece and Israel, as part of KAYS International Expansion Plans. KAYS also is targeting opening corporate owned marijuana production and processing facilities to support the envisioned franchised outlets, and to both maintain quality control and offer customers a consistent customer experience while reducing costs of goods to franchisees.

Kaya Shack™ Retail Outlets
 

All stores feature a check-out stand wrapped to feature the Company’s proprietary brand of pre-rolls, Kaya Buddies. The Buddies program is an exciting and popular pre-roll offering, featuring a wide selection (20-30 strains of pre-rolls) and featuring our special Kaya Saying in each Buddies tube. A glass display case showcases at least 25 strains of marijuana flower, which the stores serve to customers “deli style”, weighing straight from the jar to the customer’s take-out tube. An additional display case with a varied selection of oils, concentrates and topicals rounds out the cannabis product display.

Kaya Farms™
 

The Company has developed its own proprietary Kaya Farms™ strains of cannabis, which it has grown and produced at the various medical and recreational grows that the Company has operated and maintained over the past seven years in Oregon. Additionally, KAYS has produced a full line of cannabis concentrates and extracts which it has initially produced through third party manufacturers and marketed at the Kaya Shack Stores, along with the very popular Kaya Buddies line of strain specific cannabis cigarettes.
 
Please see the following pages for an overview of our current operations in Oregon.

Kaya Farms™
 

Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex
 


In early 2015, KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own a majority interest in a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. Since that time KAYS has operated various grow facilities to feed the Kaya Shack Supply Chain, and in August 2017, KAYS acquired its first property for a large scale facility- a 26-acre parcel in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon, where we intend to develop an 85,000-square foot Kaya Farms™ facility.

15
--

 


We filed for zoning and land use approval in early 2018, and after numerous regulatory challenges and delays, we finally received zoning and land use approval in early 2019 to build on the property. We have been notified by the OLCC that they are ready to proceed with KAYS Production (Grow) Licensing for the Linn County Facility pending completion of final construction.



Management believes that the development of the property will position the Company for future growth and expansion, including increased Marijuana Canopy production to the maximum extent allowed by law through use of both greenhouse and outdoor grows.
 
Under present laws the property can easily deliver 6-8,000 pounds of cannabis each year; if future regulations permit this capacity could easily be increased to over 100,000 pounds of cannabis per year.
 
When Federal Prohibition of marijuana ends and national and international cannabis trade can begin, we believe that Oregon is uniquely positioned to become America’s “pot basket” due to its superior climate and state history involving generations of Oregonian Cannabis Growers; ideal weather + extensive generational knowledge = superior, lower cost cannabis products for export.

   Kaya Buddie™ Strain Specific Cannabis Cigarettes
 



In 2016 the Company introduced a signature line of strain-specific connoisseur-grade, pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes branded as “Kaya Buddies™”. Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes have been very well received by medical patients and recreational users, with the Company selling over 100,000 Kaya Buddies™ since launching the brand in January 2016. The brand, marketed under the tagline “Buds with Benefits”, features over 50 different strains of connoisseur-grade, high quality cannabis and proprietary specialty blends. Many cannabis retailers produce prerolls, but none that we know of offer strain specific prerolls made from the buds of the flower.

Kaya Brands International
 


After over five years of conducting “touch the plant” U.S. cannabis operations inside the strict regulatory confines of a public company, KAYS has formed Kaya Brands International, Inc. (“Kaya International” or “KBI”), to leverage its experience and expand into worldwide cannabis markets. KBI’s current operations and initiatives include Canada Greece, and Israel, with additional areas under consideration for Mexico, Uruguay and Zimbabwe.
Canada
 





Canadian Franchising:  KAYS has endeavored to launch its franchise program and growth strategy in Canada. To this end, the Company has retained the Toronto based law firm of Garfinkle Biderman LLP to prepare the legal infrastructure required to enable the Company to sell Kaya Shack™ franchises in Canada.
 
Garfinkle Biderman has since completed the necessary legal work and the Company is currently in negotiations with different potential development partners to launch franchised operations in Canada and hopes to establish up to 100 franchised locations there over the next five years.

Greece


Kaya Kannabis is a joint venture project cultivation-for-export cannabis-farming and processing project of Athens based Greekkannabis PC (“GKC”) and KBI. GKC is an Athens, Greece based cannabis company with deep ties in the Greek business community and a strong presence in the academic and agricultural communities. The alliance is designed to combine the business acumen and extensive European network of GKC with the broad cannabis industry and cannabis cultivation experience of Kaya Holdings.
 
We have selected Greece as the center of our European market activity because of its amenable cannabis regulations, favorable climate, affordable, capable workforce, and the country’s position as a major pharmaceutical center in Europe. As an EU nation Greece opens up the entire European market (where legal) to KAYS flower and oils, and as permitted, the KAYS portfolio of brands.
 
On January 11, 2021, KAYS/KBI, through a majority owned subsidiary of KBI (Kaya Farms Greece or “KFG”) and Greekkannabis (“GKC”, an Athens based Cannabis Company) executed an agreement for KBI to acquire 50% of GKC. The first 25% was acquired in January, 2021 and the remaining 25% was acquired in July, 2021. GKC’s projects include two medical cannabis cultivation and processing projects in Greece- one in Epidaurus, Greece and the other in Thebes, Greece.

Interior View- KAYS’ newest project with 50K square feet of already constructed buildings is designed to 
 fast-track sales of KAYS proprietary branded cannabis products to the EU.
 
The Epidaurus Project consists of 2 connected industrial buildings (already constructed, approximately 50,000 square feet in total under-air space) situated on 2.8 acres of land, with its own independent industrial electrical power center and ample water supply to service the needs of the facility. The Epidaurus Project will include 25,000 square feet of indoor cannabis cultivation, a 15,000 square foot EU-GMP extraction and processing facility, and a 10,000 square foot EU-GMP packing area. There is ample room for expansion with room to construct an additional 15,000 square feet on site. The joint venture is awaiting project financing and final license approval from Greek government authorities.
 
The Epidaurus project is smaller in scale than the Company’s 15-acre project in Thebes, Greece, allowing KAYS to fast-track cultivation and processing of its proprietary branded cannabis products for distribution in legal EU markets while awaiting greater legal cannabis demand to emerge prior to developing a large-scale capacity in Thebes.

Kaya Kannabis- Thebes, Greece Project
 


Kaya Kannabis Medical Cannabis Production Facility in Thebes, Greece (Project Design Rendering)

The Thebes Project, as currently envisaged by management consists of up to 20,000 sq. meters of light deprivation greenhouses and 60,000 square feet of structure to be used for storage, laboratory, processing, manufacturing, logistics, and support/administrative space. The Thebes Project has already obtained the initial cannabis construction license approvals from Greek government authorities and is awaiting project financing.
 

Situated on 15 acres of land which GKC has contracted to purchase, the Thebes Project is much larger than the Epidaurus Project and allows the Company “Room to Grow” should the legal circumstances in a country or region suddenly permit (i.e., German legalization of recreational cannabis and the subsequent rapid rise in demand). Thebes, with large scale production and processing capabilities provides KAYS the operational flexibility needed to secure and maintain market position in a rapidly evolving market arena once legal cannabis demand warrants an increase in capacity.

Israel





Kaya Shalvah Cannabis Production Facility (Project Design Rendering). 
 
Israel has been a pioneer in cannabis R&D for several decades, and is often referred to as the “Silicon Valley” of the Global Medical Cannabis Industry. Israel currently has the world’s largest medical marijuana program and is the largest importer of cannabis.
 
There is legislation under Knesset review to permit adult-use cannabis, making the domestic Israeli market an attractive opportunity. Upon legalization of adult use cannabis in Israel, KAYS expects to sell flower and oils, and as permitted, the KAYS portfolio of brands in Israel, leveraging its adult use market experience and Kaya Shack™ retail shops (through a local franchisee) to serve the domestic Israeli market, and has begun to target distribution agreements with the Israeli Pharmaceutical Industry.
 
We have chosen to become active in the Israeli cannabis market because of this position as global center of cannabis science, where technologies are specifically developed to enhance cannabis cultivation processes and yields, and innovative consumer products are emerging that have potential interest for both the medical and recreational markets throughout the world.
 
On March 30, 2021 the Company confirmed that its Israeli subsidiary, Kaya Shalvah has been awarded its initial permit from the “YAKAR”, the Department for Medical Cannabis in the Israeli Ministry of Health, to develop an Israeli cannabis cultivation and processing facility.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance.

Our foreign operations will also be subject to comparable government regulation in Greece, Israel and any other various foreign jurisdictions in which KAYS intends to operate.
 Competition
 
The legal marijuana sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of retail outlets, MMDs and grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan.
Employees
 
As of the date as of this Report, our Oregon operations have a total of 12-15 part-time store employees including budtenders, trimmers, growers, and 4 full-time employees, consisting of the Senior Vice President of Cannabis Operations, the Vice President of Marketing and Brand development, and 2 store managers. Additionally, we engage several consultants to assist with daily duties and business plan implementation and execution. Additional employees will be hired and other consultants engaged in the future as our business expands.
 

Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
 
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and overseas could adversely affect the Company’s customers and suppliers as a result of quarantines, facility closures and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak. More broadly, the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products and services, slow our international expansion plans, harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company cannot accurately predict the effect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.
