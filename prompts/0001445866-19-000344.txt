Overview
 
We are a California-based, vertically integrated holding company. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we are currently positioning ourselves to cultivate, manufacture, and distribute medical and recreational cannabis in California. Through a series of recent acquisitions, we currently operate an integrated portfolio of California cannabis and hemp companies. Our structure includes cannabis cultivation, manufacture, distribution, online education and consulting services. We believe that by focusing on industry best practices, standardization, compliance and corporate governance, NewBridge will be positioned for rapid growth in the legalized California cannabis and industrial hemp industries. 
Corporate History
 
NewBridge Global Ventures, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in May 1983 in the State of Colorado and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2008.  On November 30, 2015, we consummated the transaction evidenced by an Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange dated October 8, 2015 by and among NABUFIT Global and NABUFIT Denmark, pursuant to which NABUFIT Global acquired from the stockholders of NABUFIT Denmark all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of NABUFIT Denmark. Effective August 30, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement on Transfer of Shares (“Transfer Agreement”) whereby it sold all of the interest held in its operating subsidiaries NABUFIT Denmark, NABUFIT China, and NABUFIT IP (“Operating Subsidiaries”) and consequently ceased its prior operations (“Operations Sale”).
 
On October 19, 2017, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation effecting a change of the Company’s name from Nabufit Global, Inc. to NewBridge Global Ventures, Inc. to more accurately reflect its business objectives. The name change was effective as of December 12, 2017 and the Company’s new symbol is 

4

“NBGV”. On February 14, 2018, the Company elected to form Elevated Education, Inc. (“Elevated”) as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 19, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with Elevated Portfolio Holdings, LLC (“Elevated Portfolio”), whereby Elevated agreed to purchase the assets of Elevated Portfolio.
 
On July 14, 2018, the Company acquired the following assets in an effort to expand its operations in the legal cannabis industry: 725 E 11th, LLC, a California limited liability company; Mad Creek Farm, LLC, a California limited liability company; Timothy Lane, LLC, a California limited liability company; 5Leaf, LLC, a California limited liability company; GLML, LLC, a California limited liability company and Roots Nursery, Inc., a California corporation (the “Acquired Entities”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Acquired Entities (the “Acquired Interests”) from the equity holders of those companies (the “Sellers”) in exchange for an aggregate of 31,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Exchange”). The closing of the Share Exchange took place on July 14, 2018. Upon the closing of the Share Exchange, the Company became the sole owner of the Acquired Entities and, immediately following the Share Exchange, the Sellers owned approximately 76% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock immediately thereafter. 
 
On September 28, 2018, the Company was assigned 100% interest in The Bay Clonery, LLC (“The Bay Clonery”) and Green Thumb Distributors, Inc. (“Green Thumb”), both newly formed entities by a related party. On October 5, 2018, NewBridge transferred 50% interest in Green Thumb to Eric Tran a Director of NewBridge.
 
 On September 12, 2018, NewBridge provided Roots notice of termination of the Roots Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01 of the Roots Nursery, Inc. Share Exchange and Purchase Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), effective immediately. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company cancelled a total of 9,850,000 shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the July 14 Closing. On the same day, the Company issued a total of 9,850,000 shares to acquire East 10th Street LLC, a California limited liability real estate company, for 2,925,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and the rights to certain trademarks, logos, business operating procedures, marketing material and future plans for a tissue culture lab and cloning operations for 6,925,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. These assets were acquired from Sam Mac and Eric Tran, respectively, both directors and principal shareholders in the Company.
 
On September 17, 2018, the Company formed Roots of Caly, LLC (“Roots”) and Mad Creek, LLC, (“Mad Creek, LLC”) both California Limited liability companies.
 
Our Present Business
 
Through our subsidiaries, we are currently positioning ourselves to cultivate, manufacture and distribute medical and recreational cannabis in California. 
 
Our Operating Subsidiaries (wholly owned unless otherwise noted)
 
Roots of Caly, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Roots”), is building-out a 6,000 square-foot state-of-the-art facility on Company-owned property located in the “green zone” of Oakland, California. Once operational, we believe that Roots will have the capacity to produce more than 65,000 clones each month. A well-known industry brand, Roots expects to produce clones from mother plants, supplying high-quality genetics to our own cultivation operations and other cultivators located throughout California. Roots of Caly was formed September 17, 2018.
 
The Bay Clonery, LLC, a California limited liability company (“The Bay Clonery”), is building-out 5,000 square feet of a 11,500 square-foot warehouse and an additional 16 clean rooms for clone storage all located on a 1.41-acre Company-owned property located in Santa Rosa, California. The Company anticipates that The Bay Clonery will operate as an indoor nursery and tissue culture lab, which will have the capacity to produce and sell more than 100,000 clones per month. By preserving genetics of proprietary cannabis strains, The Bay Clonery plans to collaborate with breeders and seed banks to archive a genetic library. This will allow us to test the genetic makeup of various strains that show promise. By identifying strains that show higher percentages of specific compounds, we believe, although there can be no assurance, that we can produce new products that may prove of significant potential for the medical community. The Bay Clonery was formed by a related party on May 21, 2018 and assigned to NewBridge on July 23, 2018 for nominal consideration. There was no activity in this entity through June 30, 2018.

5Leaf, LLC, a California limited liability company (“5Leaf”), is positioning itself to be a leading cannabis and industrial hemp processor and manufacturer of Full Spectrum Oils (“FSO”), distillate and isolate for local craft cannabis cultivators and other health and wellness brands. 5Leaf plans to operate in two separate facilities, both of which are currently under construction. One facility is a 10,500 square-foot, Company-owned, extraction facility in Oakland, California. 5Leaf will also utilize an additional 6,500 square-feet of the 11,500 square-foot, Company-owned facility located on a 1.41-acre property in Santa Rosa, California with The Bay Clonery. Upon completion, 5Leaf expects to have the capacity to process more than 2,000 lbs. of biomass per day, yielding an estimated 200 lbs. of FSO.
 
Genus Management Group, LLC (formerly GLML, LLC), a California limited liability company (“Genus”), is an Oakland-based services company that is integral in the operations of 5Leaf, Roots, and The Bay Clonery. With over 45 years of collective experience building successful and compliant California cannabis companies, we believe that Genus is uniquely positioned to provide consulting services to cultivators, processors, and retail brands. Its services include compliance, licensing, permitting, budgeting, brand/product development, and business development 
 
Mad Creek, LLC, a California limited liability company, was formed to manage operations on Mad Creek Farm, LLC, which are expected to begin during 2019. There was no activity in this entity through December 31, 2018.
 
Green Thumb Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“Green Thumb”), intends to become a licensed distribution company in the State of California. However, there can be no assurance that Green Thumb will be issued such license. Upon approval of its license application, Green Thumb intends to package, label, and distribute various products to cultivators, manufacturers and retailers throughout California requiring third-party distribution services. The Company is currently leasing a 5,000 square-foot facility located in the “green zone” of Oakland, California. Green Thumb was formed by a related party on June 8, 2018 and assigned to NewBridge on July 23, 2018 for nominal consideration. On October 5, 2018 NewBridge transferred 50% interest in Green Thumb to Eric Tran a Director of NewBridge. There was no activity in this entity through December 31, 2018.
 
Elevated Education, Inc, a Delaware corporation (“Elevated Education”). By educating physicians, clinicians, healthcare insurers, public servants, educators and cannabis industry professionals on proper, safe and effective applications for medical cannabis, Elevated Education empowers practitioners, through online educational modules, with the competence and confidence to educate their patients and students with healthier, more-effective treatments using CBD, hemp and cannabis derivatives
Wholly-Owned Real Estate Holding Companies
 
Mad Creek Farm, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Mad Creek”), is a real estate holding company that owns a 27-acre farm consisting of two parcels of land (+/- 5 and 22-acre tracts), where the Company intends to grow world-renowned, Emerald Triangle, California cannabis. We anticipate being able to construct two state-of-the-art greenhouse facilities totaling 15,000 square feet. As of the date of this Annual Report, our Mad Creek property is subject to an outstanding mortgage debt obligation of approximately $351,000. 
 
East 10th Street, LLC, a California limited liability company (“East 10th St.”), is a real estate holding company which owns 6,000 square feet of commercial warehouse space in the “Green Zone” of Oakland, California.

Joint Venture
 
On February 14, 2019, the Company and EcoXtraction LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company (“EcoXtraction”) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “EcoXtraction Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company issued to 

6

EcoXtraction an aggregate of 2,350,000 shares of the Company’s common stock par value $0.0001 per share (the “EcoXtraction Shares”), and EcoXtraction sold to the Company certain equipment and other tangible property. EcoXtraction and the Company also took steps to create a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”). In connection with the Joint Venture, on February 14, 2019, the Company and EcoXtraction entered into a license agreement, pursuant to which EcoXtraction sub-licensed to the Company certain intellectual property, and further, the Company and EcoXtraction created CleanWave Labs, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“CleanWave”) with each of the Company and EcoXtraction as members of CleanWave. The Company shall own 50% of the member equity interests and 50% of the member profit interests of CleanWave. CleanWave was created primarily for the purpose of (i) exploiting certain proprietary technologies being assigned and licensed to the Company by EcoXtraction designed to extract CBD, THC, as well as additional compounds from cannabis and hemp plants and (ii) manufacture and market equipment derived from that technology for use in extracting CBD, THC and additional compounds. The foregoing is merely a summary of the Joint Venture, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 21, 2019 and the exhibits attached thereto.
 
Competition 
 
There are many businesses which provide consulting and other ancillary services to businesses within the medical and recreational cannabis industry. There can be no assurance that other parties will not seek to emulate our business methods and practices. Many of those companies can be expected to have greater financial and management expertise than the Company. If such competitors arise, it could have a serious adverse effect on the Company.
Reliance on Third Party Suppliers and Distributors
 
Since we are fully vertically integrated, we will have substantial control over the seed-to-sale process of much of our product, which we plan to grow, extract, package, distribute, and deliver. We will be reliant upon third-party laboratories for testing as as required by state regulations. We will also source much of our packaging materials from third parties. Reliance upon suppliers for packaging supplies is standard in this industry; however, we are working to develop a partnership with a wholesale supplier of cannabis packaging products. 
 
All distribution and testing will be arranged by Green Thumb Distributors and as such we will not require a third-party distributor. 
 
5Leaf has significant processing potential beyond the internally generated supply. We will source additional biomass to process in our extraction facilities. As such we will be reliant on third-party these third-party biomass suppliers. 
 
Significant Customers
 
No significant customers yet.
    Distribution Methods 
 
All distribution activities will be performed by Green Thumb Distributors, Inc. a California Corporation licensed by the Bureau of Cannabis Control to distribute, package, and grow cannabis. We will use Green Thumb Distributors to move cannabis goods from manufacturers and cultivators to retailers. 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We have strain IP, but due to the nascent nature of the industry and the illegality of the product on the federal level, no patents for the product itself. 
Government and Industry Regulation
 
Federal Regulation and Our Business
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance and is therefore illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized, its use, possession, or cultivation remains a violation of federal laws. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of 

7

safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of the date of this report, 30 states and the District of Columbia allow their residents to use medical cannabis. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. However, recent statements by the Trump administration, in particular by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions, indicate that this policy may be under review. In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate proposing to change federal law such that states could regulate medical use of cannabis without risk of prosecution. A key component of the proposed Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) is to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. There is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. We intend to harvest, distribute and sell cannabis, and we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government.
 
Section 537 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 prohibits the expenditure by the Department of Justice of any funds to prevent the implementation of medical marijuana laws by any state or the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico. In United States v McIntosh, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the operators and growers had standing to challenge federal indictments for violations of the Controlled Substances Act. It is unknown whether future appropriations acts will include similar provisions or whether other circuits will follow the lead of the 9th Circuit.
 
DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states. In January 2018, former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo. However, the federal government, to date, has not determined to devote federal government resources to companies operating in states which have passed laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana use whose businesses are operating in conformity with the provisions of the Cole Memo.
 
We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see “The Cole Memo”), however, we cannot provide assurance that the Company is in full compliance with the laws since the repeal of the Cole Memo or with the Cole Memo itself or any other federal laws or regulations. The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”): (a) preventing distribution of cannabis to minors; (b) preventing revenue from cannabis from going to gangs, cartels and other illegal participants; (c) preventing the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is illegal; (d) preventing state-authorized cannabis activity from being a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs; (e) preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; (f) preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; and (g) preventing the growing of cannabis on public lands and its use or possession on Federal property.
 
The DOJ may issue in the future supplemental guidance directing that prosecutors also consider the Enforcement Priorities with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money transmitter, and BSA offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA.

State Regulation of Our Business
 
Regulation of cannabis and cannabinoids varies by state. Our operations are conducted primarily in California and as such we are subject to California cannabis regulations.
 
The California Medical and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which became effective January 1, 2018, is the governing law for both medical and adult use of cannabis in California. The rules are complex.
Regulatory Agencies
 
The Bureau of Cannabis Control (“Bureau”) oversees cannabis transportation, storage, distribution, sales, and testing. The Department of Food and Agriculture, through its CalCannabis Cultivation licensing program, oversees cannabis cultivation, issues plant tags, and is developing and implementing the track and trace program. The State Department of Public Health, through its Office of Manufactured Cannabis Safety (“OMCS”), oversees cannabis manufacturers. Finally, there are additional state agencies with smaller roles, such as the Department of Pesticides, the California State Board of Equalization, the State Water Resources Control Board, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Justice, and state law enforcement. These State agencies promulgated emergency regulations effective through June 30, 2018 which were extended as amended through December 31, 2018. On January 16, 2019, the Office of Administrative Law (“OAL”) approved the California Department of Good and Agriculture’s cannabis cultivation regulations and the regulations went into effect immediately. The emergency regulations are no longer in effect, now that the new regulations have been adopted by OAL. 
 The transition period in the licensing authorities’ regulations allowing exceptions from specific regulatory provisions ended on June 30, 2018. Beginning July 1, 2018, cannabis goods must meet all statutory and regulatory requirements. Cannabis goods that do not meet all statutory and regulatory requirements must be destroyed in accordance with the rules pertaining to destruction.
 
Laboratory Testing Requirements
 
Beginning July 1, 2018, a licensee may only sell cannabis goods that have been tested and passed all testing requirements in effect at the time of testing. Untested cannabis goods cannot be sold by a retailer and must be destroyed. A retailer may not send cannabis goods to a distributor for testing. Untested cannabis goods manufactured or harvested before January 1, 2018, in possession of a distributor that are owned by the distributor must be destroyed.
 
Untested cannabis goods manufactured or harvested before January 1, 2018, in the possession of a distributor owned by a manufacturer or cultivator may be returned to the licensee who owns the cannabis goods. If a cultivator or manufacturer chooses to sell the returned cannabis goods, the cannabis goods must be sent to a distributor for testing and must meet all of the testing requirements in effect at the time of testing before transported to a retailer for sale.
 
Packaging and Labeling Requirements
 
Beginning July 1, 2018, all packaging and labeling must be performed prior to cannabis goods being transported to a retailer. A retailer shall not accept cannabis goods that are not properly packaged and labeled. A retailer shall not package or label cannabis goods, even if the cannabis goods were in inventory before July 1, 2018. However, for medicinal sales, retailers will place a sticker on cannabis goods stating, “FOR MEDICAL USE ONLY” upon sale to a qualified medicinal consumer, unless the statement is already printed on the package. A retailer may not send unpackaged cannabis goods to another licensee for packaging or labeling. Cannabis goods in possession of a retailer that do not meet packaging and labeling requirements must be destroyed. Exit packaging is not required to be child-resistant and can no longer be used to satisfy the child-resistant packaging requirements. All cannabis goods must be in child-resistant packaging prior to delivery to a retailer.
 
THC Limits
 
Beginning January 1, 2019, edible cannabis goods may not exceed 10 milligrams of THC per serving and may not exceed 100 milligrams of THC per package. Non-edible cannabis products must meet package THC restrictions and shall not contain more than 1,000 milligrams of THC per package if intended for sale only in the adult-use market. Non-edible cannabis products shall not contain more than 2,000 milligrams of THC per package if intended for sale only in the medicinal market.
 
9

Ingredients and Appearance of Cannabis
 
Beginning July 1, 2018, a retailer may only sell cannabis products that meet the requirements set by the California Department of Public Health for ingredients or appearance.
 
Additional Important State Law Provisions
 
Obtaining a state license requires a local jurisdiction permit to operate. Local jurisdictions are not required to permit cannabis businesses. While there is no residency requirement to own or operate a medicinal or adult-use cannabis business at the state level, local jurisdictions may attempt to impose residency restrictions. Colocation of medical and adult-use/means are permitted.
 
Vertical integration is permitted and there are no limitations on how many licenses a person may hold, except testing labs must remain separate from all other license types. Local governments may attempt to impose their own limits on how many licenses someone can own. The holder of any license type, other than a testing licensee, may hold a distributor license. Ownership is defined as any person or entity owning a twenty percent or greater stake, or any person with the power to control management decisions. Owners are subject to background investigation. Additional financial interests, as defined, must be disclosed.
 
Licensees may also seek issuance of a temporary event license to operate at a county fair or district agricultural association event, which would permit on-site cannabis consumption, provided there is no local jurisdictional ban and the licensee complies with certain other requirements (i.e., no alcohol or tobacco consumption would be allowed on premises, customers must be over twenty-one, etc.). Retailers must separately report on state designated fairground sales beginning July 1, 2018.
 
California requires testing of cannabis for pesticides, mold, mildew, and other contaminants and explicitly prohibits the use of banned pesticides and sets standards for certification of organic cannabis. Cannabis and cannabis products must be packaged in opaque packaging and identify infused edibles with a created universal symbol.
 
Cultivators must identify their water source and obtain all necessary state and local permits for water usage. The Department of Food and Agriculture has the authority to limit the issuance of unique identifying tags (required for all legally grown plants) if there are adverse impacts to the environment caused by the cultivation. Growing or processing cannabis where these activities result in a violation of specified laws relating to the unlawful taking of fish and wildlife is a felony.
 
Priority Grant of Licenses
 
Businesses that were operating in compliance with state law before September 1, 2016, will have priority during licensing. Cannabis businesses that were lawfully operating under California state law and with relevant local licensing before January 1, 2018, may continue operating while their applications are reviewed. The Bureau will determine whether an applicant was lawfully operating by reviewing the date on which the applicant began actively conducting the same commercial cannabis activity as the license type for which the applicant is applying, and evidence to prove compliant operations.
 
Medicinal cannabis businesses who opt not to apply for a state license on or before January 1, 2018, will continue to receive protections from criminal prosecution provided by state law for one year after the first state licenses are issued. However, criminal defenses do not provide protections from state regulatory enforcement beginning January 1, 2018, thereby exposing businesses operating under the prior collective or cooperative model to the risks of civil or regulatory enforcement if they continue to operate without a state or local license after January 1, 2018. In the spring of 2019, operators without a license will likely no longer be able to assert defenses to criminal prosecution under the collective or cooperative model.
 
10



Prior law required that cannabis operations be solely operated under a non-profit model. There are numerous hurdles for businesses operating under the prior law to transition to a fully regulated for profit model. Transition to a for-profit model is complex. Competent California counsel should be consulted with a deep knowledge of the industry and regulatory scheme.
 The following table outlines the Company’s subsidiaries status of the permitting and licensing at the local and state levels:
