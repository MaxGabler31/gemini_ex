Corporate History
 
Orient Paper, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 9, 2005, under the name “Carlateral, Inc.” Through the steps described immediately below, we became the holding company for Hebei Baoding Orient Paper Milling Company Limited (“Orient Paper HB”), a producer and distributor of paper products in China, on October 29, 2007, and effective December 21, 2007, we changed our name to “Orient Paper, Inc.” to more accurately describe our business.
 
On October 29, 2007, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), the Company acquired Dongfang Zhiye Holding Limited (“Dongfang Holding”), a corporation formed on November 13, 2006 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and issued the shareholders of Dongfang Holding an aggregate of 7,450,497 (as adjusted for a four-for-one reverse stock split effected in November 2009) shares of our common stock, which shares were distributed pro-rata to the shareholders of Dongfang Holding in accordance with their respective ownership interests in Dongfang Holding. At the time of the Merger Agreement, Dongfang Holding owned all of the issued and outstanding stock and ownership of Orient Paper HB and such shares of Orient Paper HB were held in trust with Zhenyong Liu, Xiaodong Liu and Shuangxi Zhao, for Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhao (the original shareholders of Orient Paper HB) to exercise control over the disposition of Dongfang Holding’s shares in Orient Paper HB on Dongfang Holding’s behalf, until Dongfang Holding successfully completed the change in registration of Orient Paper HB’s capital with the relevant PRC Administration of Industry and Commerce as the 100% owner of Orient Paper HB’s shares. As a result of the merger transaction, Dongfang Holding became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Dongfang Holding’s wholly owned subsidiary, Orient Paper HB, became an indirectly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Dongfang Holding, as the 100% owner of Orient Paper HB, was unable to complete the registration of Orient Paper HB’s capital under its name within the required time limits set forth under PRC law. In connection with the consummation of the restructuring transactions described below, Dongfang Holding directed the trustees to return the shares of Orient Paper HB to the original shareholders of Orient paper HB, and the original shareholders entered into certain agreements with Baoding Shengde Paper Co., Ltd. (“Orient Paper Shengde”) to transfer the control of Orient Paper HB to Orient Paper Shengde.

On June 24, 2009, the Company consummated a number of restructuring transactions pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Shengde Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation. Shengde Holdings Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 25, 2009, and holds a wholly-owned subsidiary, Orient Paper Shengde, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC on June 1, 2009. Because Orient Paper Shengde is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shengde Holdings Inc., it is regarded as a wholly foreign-owned entity under PRC law.
 
Effective June 24, 2009, Orient Paper Shengde, Orient Paper HB and the original shareholders of Orient Paper HB entered into a number of contractual arrangements, as subsequently amended on February 10, 2010, pursuant to which Orient Paper Shengde acts as the management company for Orient Paper HB, and Orient Paper HB conducts the principal operations of the business. The contractual arrangements, as amended, effectively transferred the preponderance of the economic benefits of Orient Paper HB to Orient Paper Shengde, and Orient Paper Shengde assumed effective control and management over Orient Paper HB. The contractual arrangements, as amended, include the following:
 

(i) | Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement

Specifically, Orient Paper Shengde is entitled to dispose of the pledged equity interests in the event that the Orient Paper HB shareholders or Orient Paper HB fails to pay the service fees to Orient Paper Shengde pursuant to the exclusive technical service and business consulting agreement or fails to perform their other obligations under the other management agreement. The agreement contains covenants from Orient Paper HB’s shareholders that they will refrain from taking certain actions without Orient Paper Shengde’s prior written consent, such as transferring or assigning their equity interests, or creating or permitting the creation of any pledges which may have an adverse effect on the rights or benefits of Orient Paper Shengde under the agreement. The Orient Paper HB shareholders also promise to comply with the laws and regulations relevant to the pledges under the agreement and to facilitate in good faith the protection of the ability of Orient Paper Shengde to exercise its rights under the agreement. The terms of the share pledge agreement remains in effect until all the obligations under the other management agreements have been fulfilled, whether or not the terms of the other management agreements have expired.
 

(iv) | Proxy Agreement
-----+----------------

 
The proxy agreement, entered into by and between Orient Paper Shengde, Orient Paper HB and the shareholders of Orient Paper HB, provides that the Orient Paper HB shareholders shall irrevocably entrust a designee of Orient Paper Shengde with such shareholder’s voting rights and the right to represent such shareholder to exercise his or her rights at any shareholder’s meeting of Orient Paper HB or with respect to any shareholder action to be taken in accordance with the laws and Orient Paper HB’s Articles of Association. The terms of the agreement are binding on the parties for as long as the Orient Paper HB shareholders continue to hold any equity interest in Orient Paper HB. An Orient Paper HB shareholder will cease to be a party to the agreement once it transfers its equity interests with the prior approval of Orient Paper Shengde.
 
On June 24, 2009, Zhao Tianqing, the sole shareholder of Shengde Holdings Inc., assigned to Orient Paper, for good and valuable consideration, 100 shares representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Shengde Holdings Inc. As a result of this assignment and the restructuring transactions described above, Shengde Holdings Inc., Orient Paper Shengde, and Orient Paper HB became directly and indirectly controlled by Orient Paper, and Orient Paper HB continued to function as the Company’s operating entity.

In addition to controlling the operations and beneficial ownership of Orient Paper HB, Orient Paper Shengde also acquired a digital photo paper production line (including two photo paper coating lines and ancillary equipment) in an asset acquisition transaction on November 25, 2009 and began directly conducting business in the PRC. We suspended production of photo paper in June 2016 and now are upgrading the production line to produce more competitive photo paper products. We expect to resume our digital photo paper production in the near future.
 
An agreement was entered into among Orient Paper Shengde, Orient Paper HB and the shareholders of Orient Paper HB on December 31, 2010, reiterating that Orient Paper Shengde is entitled to the distributable profit of Orient Paper HB, pursuant to the above mentioned Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement. In addition, Orient Paper HB and the shareholders of Orient Paper HB agreed that they would not declare any of Orient Paper HB’s unappropriated earnings, including any earnings of Orient Paper HB from its establishment to 2010 and thereafter, as dividend.

Our Business
 
We engage in production and distribution of three categories of paper products: corrugating medium paper, offset printing paper and tissue paper products.
 
In late January, 2018, the company temporarily suspended its production due to a government-mandated restriction on the natural gas supply, which is the energy resource we need for production. As of March 14, 2018, the company resumed production at its manufacturing facilities.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at Science Park, Juli Road, Xushui District, Baoding City, Hebei Province, People’s Republic of China. Our telephone number is (86) 312-869-8215. Our website is located at http://www.orientpaperinc.com
 
Manufacturing Process
 
Corrugating Medium Paper and Offset Printing Paper
 
Our current products (excluding tissue paper products) generally undergo two stages of manufacturing: (1) creating pulp from recycled paper products, and (2) treating the pulp and molding it into the desired types of paper products.  A brief overview of the pulp and papermaking process is provided below.
Pulping
 
The recycled waste paper is first sorted by machine, and then broken down and beaten or smashed into small pieces using water and mechanical energy. It is then put through a course screening drum, followed by a fine screening drum to separate different grades of pulp, a process that we refer as “concentration”. In order to purify the pulp further, an approach flow system is used to filter out any impurities or inconsistencies, such as sand, in the pulp.
Paper Making
 
The pulp is sieved to remove the excess water and molded into a specific size. The moisture content is further reduced by applying hydraulic pressure to the pulp.  The pulp then enters the drying section where it is rolled over by heated cylinders. The dried paper is then coated with a mixture of clay, white pigment and binder to produce a surface on which ink can sit without being fully absorbed, enabling crisper, more consistent print quality.

The paper goes through a process called calendaring, which flattens and smoothens the paper into long sheets. The paper is then wound onto a reel that is mounted in a roll-slitting machine for rewinding, during which cutters are used to cut the paper into the desired widths. Upon completion, the rolls are fitted with sleeves and labeled, and then sent to quality control before shipment or storage.
 


Base Tissue Paper
 
While we make tissue paper products, we currently do not manufacture base tissue paper.
 
Products
 
Corrugating medium paper
 
Corrugating medium paper, or CMP is used in the manufacturing of cardboard. Since the launch of our new Paper Machine (“PM6”) production line in December 2011, corrugating medium paper has become a major product of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2017, corrugating medium paper comprised approximately 87.9% of our total paper production quantities and roughly 82.02% of our total revenue.  Raw materials used in the production of corrugating medium paper include recycled paper board (or Old Corrugating Cardboard or “OCC,” as it is commonly referred to in the United States) and certain supplementary agents. In January 2013, we suspended the operation of our PM1 production line for renovation, which was then used to produce corrugating medium paper. In May 2014, we launched the commercial production of the newly renovated PM1 production line. The new PM1 production line produces light-weight corrugating medium paper with a specification of 40 to 80 grams per square meter (“g/s/m”). PM1’s light-weight corrugating medium paper products have a wide range of commercial applications. For example, they can be used as a construction material for wall and floor insulation or to manufacture moisture-proof packaging materials for the transportation of books and magazines by the publishing industry. It can also be used as corrugating medium to make corrugating cardboard for packaging that requires light-weight boxes. The manufacturing process of light-weight corrugating medium paper is similar to that of the regular corrugating medium paper and also uses recycled paper boards as a major source of raw material. We now have two corrugating medium paper production lines, PM6 and PM1. We refer to products produced from the PM6 production line as Regular CMP and products produced from the PM1 production line as Light-Weight CMP.


Offset printing paper
 
Offset printing paper is used for offset printing in the publishing industry.  Offset printing paper comprised approximately 11.3% of our total paper production quantities and approximately 15.97% of our total sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Raw materials used in making offset printing paper include recycled white scrap paper, fluorescent whitening agent and sizing agent. We currently have two production lines, PM2 and PM3, for the production of offset printing paper.

Tissue Paper Products
 
We began the commercial production of tissue paper products in Wei County Industry Park in June 2015. We process base tissue paper purchased from long-term cooperative third party and produce finished tissue paper products, including toilet paper, boxed and soft-packed tissues, handkerchief tissues and paper napkins, as well as bathroom and kitchen paper towels that are marketed and sold under the Orient Paper brand. We sold 1,804 tonnes of tissue paper products for $2,356,856 in 2017. We expect to continue to increase production of our tissue paper products in the near future.
 
Market for our Products
 
The PRC Paper Making Industry
 
According to the 2016 China Paper Industry Annual Report, issued by the China Paper Association, there were approximately 2,800 paper and paper board manufacturers (down from 3,700 in 2010) in China, with a total output of 108.55 million tonnes, up by1.35% from 107.10 million tonnes in 2015. Total domestic consumption was 104.19 million tonnes in 2016, up by 0.65% from 103.52 million tonnes in 2015.
 
Compared with 2007, output in 2016 increased by approximately 47.69% and consumption grew by approximately 42.92%. The output of paper and paper board maintained an average growth rate of approximately 4.43% during the ten-year period from 2007 to 2016, while consumption increased at an average annual rate of 4.05%. The growth is expected to continue. It is estimated that China currently has the largest paper and paper board products output and consumption in the world. (Data source: 2016 Annual Report of China Paper Manufacturing, September 2017, China Paper Association)

Industry Consolidation
 
Historically, the paper and pulp industry in China was comprised of numerous small-scale production enterprises, many of which used low-technology production processes that produce significant pollution.  In 1996, China’s State Council issued “Decisions on Environmental Protection Issues,” setting forth strict rules and regulations intended to reduce pollution, including a directive for the closure of all paper plants with an annual output of less than 50,000 tonnes.  Recognizing that China constitutes one of the largest markets for paper consumption in the world and with potential for continued expansion, the PRC government continues its efforts to consolidate, modernize, and promote the environmental sustainability of the industry.
 
As part of its 11th “Five Year Economic Development Plan,” the PRC State Council announced on May 5, 2010 that up to 530,000 tonnes of inefficient/polluting paper production capacity was to be eliminated or shut down in 2010. On August 5, 2010, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (the “MIIT”) published a list of mandatory capacity closures and ordered the shutdown of a total of 4.6 million tonnes of capacity by September 2010. Following the first wave of mandatory capacity closures in 2010, the MIIT announced on July 11, 2011 that 8.2 million tonnes of outdated paper milling capacity at 599 paper companies across China were required to close down in 2011, of which 72 companies with a total capacity of 1.07 million tonnes that accounts for 13% of total closures were located in the province of Hebei. 
 
According to “The Twelfth ‘Five-Year Plan’ for the Chinese Paper Industry,” published jointly by the National Development and Reform Commission, the MIIT and the National Forestry Bureau in December 2011, the central government of China determined to eliminate more than 10 million tonnes of paper production capacity during the five-year period ended 2015. The goal, through mandatory capacity elimination and industry consolidation, was to transform the paper industry landscape into one where the number of one-million-tonnes-and-above manufacturers would increase from 10 to more than 20. According to the MIIT announcement on September 6, 2012, a total of 9.9 million tonnes of outdated paper production capacity was ordered to close in 2012. On July 25, 2013, the MIIT announced a list of outdated paper facilities slated for closure in 2013. According to MIIT, a total of 6.21 million tonnes of paper manufacturing capacity on the July 25, 2013 list across the country was required to be shut down by the end of 2013, including 930,800 tonnes in the Hebei Province. In September 2013, the second batch of closures targeting 1.2 million tonnes nationwide was announced by the MIIT. The closure of outdated facilities continued in 2014 and a total of 4.92 million tonnes of paper manufacturing capacity was shut down. On July 24, 2014, the MIIT announced that facilities producing 3.97 million tonnes of paper and pulp, including 500,000 tonnes in Hebei Province, were mandated to be retired by the end of 2014. On August 18, 2014, MIIT announced another list of outdated paper facilities that were required to be closed by the end of 2014. The August 18, 2014 list shut down 0.66 million tonnes of paper manufacturing capacity, including 5,000 tonnes in Hebei Province. Unlike the mandatory closures in previous years when, most of the closures involved small-scale local mills, usually with less than 50,000 tonnes of production capability and without proper water treatment practices, the 2013 and 2014 mandatory closure lists included a number of large capacity paper machines (up to 226,000 tonnes per line) that failed to meet the environmental and energy savings standards.
 
The mandatory closure of outdated capacity is expected to continue to in the next few years. As a result, we estimate that the average selling prices for corrugating medium paper and other packaging paper will remain relatively stable in 2018, and the paper industry will witness increased competition and higher standards for environmental protection measures. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business -We might be negatively affected by the industry capacity elimination mandated by the government.”
 
Customers
 
We generally sell our corrugating medium paper to companies making corrugating cardboards and offset printing paper to printing companies. Five of our top 10 customers in 2017 are printing companies. The largest customer being a printing company in Langfang city, Hebei Province. Our total corrugating medium and offset printing paper revenue in 2017 was primarily derived from customers in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province.

We target corporate customers in the middle range of the marketplace, where, with solid quality and competitive pricing, we see potential for high volume growth for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper.Our primary market has been the region of North China, especially in the province of Hebei.
Our Production Lines
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had six PM production lines in operation and are in the process of launching three more that are tentatively designated as PM7, PM8 and PM9. These production lines include the followings:

PM# | Paper Product Produced | Designed Capacity (tonnes/year) | | Owned by | | Operated by | | Status as of December 31, 2017

On December 31, 2009, we acquired a digital photo paper production line, including two coating lines that are designated as PM4 and PM5 and ancillary equipment, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.6 million. We suspended production of photo paper in June 2016 and now are upgrading the production line to produce more competitive photo paper products. We expect to resume our digital photo paper production in the near future.
 
In order to meet the growing domestic demand for paper, which we believe currently exceeds domestic supply in the case of corrugating medium paper, especially in the region of North China, we installed a corrugating medium paper production line (PM6) with a designed capacity of 360,000 tonnes per year. We completed the installation of the new PM6 production line in November 2011 and began commercial production in December 2011.
 
We have implemented a plan to renovate one of the old production lines that has been idle since the end of 2007. We previously made paper with anti-counterfeit features from that production line. When the renovation is completed, we intend to use the renovated production line to produce high-profit margin specialty papers. Our current plan is to complete the renovation project, put in place a new production and marketing team and launch the renovated production line as PM7 by the end of 2018.
 
On November 27, 2012, we signed a 15-year lease relating to approximately 49.4 acres of land in the Economic Development Zone in Wei County, Hebei Province, China for the purpose of developing a new tissue paper production plant. We plan to build two tissue paper production lines, each with 15,000 tonnes/year capacity, and other packaging facilities and infrastructures on the leased land. In December 2012, we signed a contract with an equipment contractor in Shanghai to build PM8, the first of our two tissue paper production lines in Wei County. We expect the construction of PM8 to be completed in the first half of 2018. Total estimated cost of the PM8 tissue paper project (not including the construction cost of our infrastructures in the Wei County Industrial Park) is estimated to be up to $22.0 million, of which $21.0 million has been incurred thus far. 
 
We voluntarily renovated our 150,000 tonnes/year corrugating medium paper PM1 in anticipation of increased regulatory concerns on energy efficiencies as well as to improve the quality of our corrugating medium products. Rather than converting PM1 to a regular corrugating medium paper machine, we decided in 2013 that, based on the market conditions and our waste water treatment capability, the better option was to convert PM1 to produce Light-Weight CMP with a specification of 40 to 80 grams per square meter (“g/s/m”) with a designed capacity of 60,000 tonnes/year. We started the renovation in January 2013 and launched commercial production of the newly renovated PM1 production line in May 2014.
 
Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
The supplies used in our production processes are comprised mainly of recycled paper board and unprinted recycled white scrap paper, both of which are ready-to-use items and available from multiple domestic and foreign sources. We currently purchase all of our recycled paper supplies from some domestic recycling stations and do not rely on imported recycled paper. We also purchase coal and chemical agents from nearby suppliers.  Ongoing inflationary pressures and higher demand for recycled paper could lead to an increase in our costs of raw materials and production, which we may or may not be able to pass to our customers.
 
We sign annual raw materials supplier contracts with our suppliers.  Although we have contracts with our suppliers, these contracts do not lock-in the purchase price of our raw materials or provide hedge against the fluctuation in the market price of these raw materials. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had two large suppliers which accounted for approximately 69% and 8% of our total purchases, respectively.

Competition
 
Orient Paper HB’s main competitors are: Chenming Paper Group Limited, Huatai Group Limited, Nine Dragons Paper (Holdings) Limited and Sun Paper Group Limited. A number of our competitors are public entities with larger capacities, broader customer bases and greater financial resources than those available to us. The businesses of our primary competitors are briefly described below:
 
Chenming Paper Group, Ltd. (“Chenming”), based in Shandong Province (located in northeast China), produces primarily newsprint paper and art paper (high quality, heavy and two-side coated printing paper).  Chenming is believed to be the first company to have listed on all three stock exchanges in China: Renminbi A-shares and foreign currency B-shares in Shenzhen, the smaller of the mainland’s two stock exchanges, and H-shares in Hong Kong. Chenming has annual production capacity of 8.5 million tonnes for its coated wood-free paper product and is believed to rank among the top 500 enterprises in China.
 
Huatai Group, Ltd. (“Huatai”), based in Shandong Province (located in the northern part of the eastern coastal region of China), primarily produces newsprint, fine paper, special printing paper, coated board and tissue paper.  Huatai is the first Shandong papermaker to publicly list its stock and has become a famous brand in China. Its annual paper production is estimated to have reached 4 million tonnes.
 
Nine Dragons Paper (Holdings) Limited (“ND Paper”), based in Guangdong Province (located in southern China), is the largest paper manufacturer in China and primarily produces kraft paper and high-strength corrugating medium paper with annual capacity of 13 million tonnes. ND Paper has reported that it has five production lines in the city of Tianjin with a total designed capacity of 2.15 million tonnes, producing products such as kraft paper, high strength corrugating medium paper and grey-back duplex board.
 
Sun Paper Group, Ltd., based in Shandong Province, primarily produces card paper, whiteboard paper and art paper.  It also produces alkaline peroxide mechanical pulp, sourced in part from woodchips harvested by the company’s poplar plantations.  This company has reported that it has an aggregate annual production capacity of paper and pulp of approximately 5.7 million tonnes and has been listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange since 2006.
 
With the exceptions of Chenming and ND Paper, which may compete directly with us in the offset printing paper market and the corrugating medium paper market, respectively, in the Beijing/Tianjin/greater Hebei regions, we believe that we face only indirect competition from the above-listed companies, either because we have a different product assortment from these companies, or because, to the extent they do offer products similar to ours, the transportation costs and storage costs make it difficult for these companies to compete effectively with us on pricing.
 
Our Competitive Edge
 
Regional advantage (North China). We believe that Orient Paper HB is one of the leading papermaking enterprises in Hebei Province.  Our proximity to large urban centers in northern China, Beijing and Tianjin, gives us access to a large market to sell our products.

There are other paper manufacturers that are also located in Hebei Province (and close to metropolitan Beijing and Tianjin areas), but most of these other manufacturers are small in scale and unable to compete with us effectively. We also compete with other large printing paper manufacturers for Beijing printing company customers. We believe that we have cost and geographical advantages over these larger competitors.
 
Cost advantage.  Unlike some of our out-of-province competitors who must set up interim warehouses and ship products from their production base to such interim warehouses close to their customer base in Beijing, there is no need for us to set up interim warehouses, because we are approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Beijing, the cultural center of China and our largest target market. While we do not separately pay for transportation cost on raw material purchases, the transportation cost included in the raw material purchase prices from our recycled paper suppliers is lower than the transportation cost paid by our competitors in the province of Shandong. We also enjoy lower transportation costs for coal, a major source of energy used in our production process. Similarly, our customers pay lower transportation cost to pick up their orders from our finished goods warehouse in Baoding than what they would pay if they had to pick up goods from locations further away from Beijing. Tianjin, another large urban center, is also approximately 60 miles from our facilities. Baoding city itself is also home to numerous printing and packaging companies. Our geographical advantage and easy access to low-cost raw materials allow us to implement a more flexible inventory purchase policy, lower our purchase prices and inventory management expenses and reduce our production cost. As such, we have lower freight costs and other associated costs of sales, which enable us to charge lower prices, if necessary, for our products. Additionally, because we buy all recycled paper raw materials from Beijing and Tianjin, rather than from the United States or Japan, our purchase lead time is shorter as compared to manufacturers who rely on imported recycled paper.
 
Research and Development
 
Our R&D activities are carried out by a task force led by a group of senior managers (in charge of product development and quality control) and by a group of selected engineers and technicians. The Company charged the time spent on the R&D projects (manufacturing waste discharge recycling, digital photo paper and tissue paper manufacturing) to R&D expenses and incurred $31,922 and $21,598 in R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our R&D efforts in 2017 has focused on evaluating and developing new products that are in the pipeline for 2017 and included developing and improving the manufacturing process of Light-Weight CMP and the production and packaging technology of tissue paper.
 
One of our production lines, PM7, is under renovation. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, we have spent approximately $1.57 million in machine parts and new components to renovate this production line, with which we expect to produce certain specialty papers, including wood-grain deco and furniture paper, wallpaper and paper with security features (for anti-counterfeiting purposes). While we are optimistic about the prospect of the renovation project, we cannot guarantee the launch of the specialty paper production (which is tentatively scheduled by the end of 2018) or the success of such renovation.

Government Regulation
 
The testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, advertising and marketing, post-approval safety reporting and export of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the PRC. We are also subject to various other regulations and permit requirements by the Chinese government. These regulations and their impact on our business are set forth in more details below.
Environmental Regulation
 
Our operations and facilities are subject to environmental laws and regulations stipulated by the national and the local environment protection bureaus in the PRC.
 
Since the implementation of the State Council’s “Decisions on Environmental Protection Issues” in 1996, the PRC paper industry has been subject to more rigorous environmental standards.  Effective January 1, 2015, a new law promulgated by the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China makes certain violations of the environmental laws a criminal offense. We believe that we are one of the few major paper manufacturers in Hebei Province that have obtained a Pollution Discharge Permit. We initially received the permit in September 1996 and, we have successfully renewed the permit each year by complying with applicable environmental requirements.
Waste Water Treatment
 
Orient Paper HB uses a multi-level water recycling process. Waste water from the pulping process is fed into collection pools, where it is divided into two parts, water and recovered pulp fiber.  The latter is returned to the pulping process.
 
Chemical agents are added to the waste water, and the waste water is fed into a biogas reactor and filtering pools, producing purified water and depositing sludge.  Most of the purified water is recycled to produce corrugating medium paper and the sludge is pumped into a sludge pool, condensed and dehydrated. We then use the sludge as a raw material in the manufacture of corrugating medium paper.
 
We maintain computerized controls at our production facilities on a 24-hour basis to monitor compliance with environmental rules and regulations. We are not aware of any environmental investigations, prosecutions, disputes, claims or other environmental proceedings, nor have we been subject to any action by any environmental administration authorities of the PRC. To our knowledge, our operations meet or exceed the existing environmental requirements of the PRC.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately 527 full time employees. The Company provides private insurance coverage for any workplace accident or injury for all the operators of paper milling machinery in the workshops. These employees are organized into a labor union under the labor laws of the PRC and have collective bargain power against us. We generally maintain good relations with our employees and the labor union.
