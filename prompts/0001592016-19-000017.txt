ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”, “AgroFresh”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global leader in delivering innovative solutions that extend the shelf life of fresh produce. The Company is empowering the food industry with Smarter FreshnessTM, a range of integrated solutions designed to help growers, packers and retailers improve produce freshness and quality while preventing shrinkage and reducing waste.
AgroFresh’s market leadership is underpinned by our global footprint, extensive applied scientific expertise, customer intimacy, and a growing portfolio of value-added products and mission-critical advisory services. Our key products are approved for sale in over 50 countries, support approximately 3,900 direct customers and service over 25,000 storage rooms globally. In addition, we provide in-depth plant physiology expertise and offer a comprehensive list of solutions spanning from near-harvest to post-harvest, from storage through retail. More importantly, our direct market approach and high touch service model best positions us to address our customers’ needs. We believe this is a key differentiator compared to other companies that offer limited service levels.
The following tables present a breakdown of our revenue based on solutions, crop and geography for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Note: “EMEA” comprises Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. “Other” include revenue from pears, citrus, kiwifruit, avocados, bananas, and other crops.
AgroFresh’s core business provides solutions to extend the shelf life of fresh produce for both growers and packers. SmartFreshTM, our current principal solution, preserves the texture, firmness, taste and appearance of produce during storage, transportation and retail display. It allows growers and packers to deliver “just harvested” freshness on a year-round basis and enables retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh value proposition is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities together with mission-critical and value-added advisory services.
 AgroFresh has extended its post-harvest leadership with the acquisition in December 2017 of a controlling interest in Tecnidex Fruit Protection, S.A.U. (“Tecnidex”), a leading provider of fungicides, sanitizers, waxes, and coatings primarily focused on the citrus market. For over 35 years, Tecnidex has been helping fruit and vegetable producers offer clean, safe and high-quality products to customers in 18 countries. Tecnidex brought a broad catalog of solutions that enhanced our current offering, including fungicides that can be added to our innovative ActiMistTM  delivery system of foggable fungicides. The expanded offerings further diversify our revenue by expanding our ability to provide more solutions and service the citrus industry.
Complementing our post-harvest solutions, AgroFresh’s HarvistaTM technology is used for near harvest management of pome fruit (apples and pears), as well as cherries and blueberries. Just as SmartFresh revolutionized post-harvest apple storage, we believe Harvista can have a similar impact in the orchard. In apples, Harvista slows ripening, reduces fruit drop, and holds fruit on the tree longer to promote better color and fruit size, thereby bringing new benefits to the grower. With maximum flexibility in application timing, it extends the harvest window by allowing growers to factor in ever-changing weather conditions and labor availability.  We have found that the combination of Harvista in the orchard and SmartFresh in the storage room results in

 improved apple quality metrics compared to use of either product individually. When applied to cherries, Harvista offers an increase to yield of a minimum of 10%.
AgroFresh provides freshness solutions across the supply chain, including retail where much of the shrinkage occurs for certain crops. This includes bananas, the largest retail fruit category. According to data from the Journal of Consumer Affairs and United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization, it is estimated that 12-16% of banana loss occurs after the fruit reaches the grocery store. Our RipeLockTM Quality System is a retail solution that addresses this problem and improves the quality and consumer appeal of bananas. RipeLock enables retailers to extend the consumer-preferred yellow life of bananas an additional 4-6 days, reducing shrinkage at the store level and increasing sales.
To continue to evolve and increase the value we provide to our customers, we recently launched our FreshCloudTM platform consisting of produce monitoring and screening solutions with real time information delivered in the “cloud” to customers. FreshCloud is the culmination of our decades-long history of innovation and scientific know-how in the physiology of fruits and vegetables. FreshCloud consists of both enhancements to our existing service offering and customer base and new solutions to reach more crops and steps in the distribution chain. FreshCloud Storage Insights combines proprietary sensor technology and data analytics in the storage room to offer customers real-time access to unique insights into the condition of their stored fruit. FreshCloud Predictive Screening predicts the risk of disorder development during storage by analyzing gene expression at commercial harvest, resulting in more informed storage management decisions. FreshCloud Transit Insights combines sensor technology and proprietary algorithms to provide insights into the condition and quality of fruit during transit.
History
We are a former blank check company that completed our initial public offering on February 19, 2014. On July 31, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 30, 2015 (the “Purchase Agreement”), with The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”), providing for the acquisition by us of the AgroFresh business from Dow, resulting in AgroFresh Inc. becoming our wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary. On the Closing Date, we changed our name from Boulevard Acquisition Corp. to AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the business that now comprises our business was operated through a combination of wholly-owned subsidiaries and operations of Dow, including through AgroFresh Inc. in the United States.
In December 2017, AgroFresh acquired a controlling interest in Tecnidex, a leading provider of post-harvest fungicides, waxes, and biocides for the citrus market. With this acquisition, AgroFresh expanded its industry-leading post-harvest presence into additional crops and increased its penetration of the produce market in southern Europe, Latin America and Africa. 
For over 35 years, Tecnidex has been helping fruit and vegetable producers offer clean, safe and high-quality products to customers in 18 countries. Through its portfolio of post-harvest products, technology, consulting, and after-sale services, Tecnidex improves the quality and value of its clients’ fruit and vegetables while respecting the environment. Tecnidex is based in Valencia, Spain, one of the largest citrus producing regions in the world.
In December of 2017, AgroFresh invested approximately $10 million for an approximate 15% ownership stake in and entered into a commercial agreement with FFT, provider of the award-winning It’s Fresh! ethylene removal filters in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Latin America. The proprietary active ingredient of It’s Fresh! has been found to be 100 times more powerful than any other ethylene-absorbing substances, providing a powerful tool to preserve food freshness. Through our commercial agreement with FFT, AgroFresh can market It’s Fresh! for high value crops such as berries, stone fruit, avocados, tomatoes and cherries, and open up new opportunities to address food waste in retail.  As It's Fresh has recently shifted its strategic focus away from retailers to growers and packers, AgroFresh will be reviewing the extensive R&D work it has conducted to determine how the technology can be adapted for the needs of these segments of the market and determine the best path forward for the commercial agreement.
On April 9, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Comm-n-Sense Corp., d/b/a Verigo ("Verigo"). The acquisition of Verigo was important to the development of the Company's FreshCloud platform, which introduces a new level of data insights to the produce market from plant physiology to supply chain optimization, which can augment our existing portfolio of treatments and technical advisory services. 
We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulations. We have completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista to be safe for consumers, workers, and the environment. 1-MCP, the active ingredient in the AgroFresh products is metabolized by the natural processes in fruits and leaves no residue. The AgroFresh products have been approved by over 50 authorities including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission.

Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our continued growth:

Leading Agricultural Innovator and Solutions Provider with Proprietary Technical Know-How. AgroFresh has been at the forefront of fresh produce preservation solutions since our inception. Our research and development team include over 40 scientists, about half with advanced degrees, who are leaders in the fields of plant physiology. Beginning with our creation of the commercial market for 1-Methylcyclopropene (“1-MCP”) applications for use in the preservation of apples, we have produced an extensive and exclusive database of produce physiology and consumer preferences. Building on our proprietary technical knowledge, we have developed an intellectual property portfolio, including over 500 granted and pending patents, that has enabled us to provide comprehensive and innovative solutions to a global customer base. SmartFresh delivers a substantial improvement in storage solutions for apples, pears, and other crops, allowing for significantly less waste and greater productivity, as well as a constant supply of high-quality fruit throughout the year. In the U.S., we estimate that 90% of stored apples are treated with 1-MCP, and our SmartFresh technology continues to enjoy a strong leadership position in this treatment protocol. Extending our record of innovation in the post-harvest market, we entered the near-harvest market with the introduction of Harvista which extends the ideal harvest window for apples and pears, and increases production yields for cherries and blueberries to improve harvest management and enhance fruit quality. The commercialization of Harvista was followed by our introduction of RipeLock, an innovative fruit quality management system for bananas, offering flexibility and consistency to retailers to deliver bananas at a yellow color and ripeness preferred by consumers. Building on this success, we entered the fungicide market with ActiMist and subsequently enhanced our fungicide portfolio with the acquisition of Tecnidex in 2017. Our recent launch of FreshCloud is the latest milestone in our new product innovation. With the FreshCloud platform, we expect to be able to provide customers real time insights about the condition of their fruit using novel monitoring technologies. 
Diversified Global Presence Across All Major Growing Regions. We have established a global footprint with key products approved in over 50 countries that supports approximately 3,900 direct customers and serves over 25,000 storage rooms globally. Our top ten customers represent less than 15% of the Company's total revenue, a sign of the strength and resilience of our business. The Company's global commercial platform is unique in the post-harvest industry, positioned across six continents, bringing a full suite of AgroFresh solutions and high-touch advisory services to customers in every key produce-growing region. Our ability to deliver an in-depth of technical service and products across every major continent is a fundamental competitive advantage in our pursuit of capturing growth opportunities. We believe our global footprint provides not only a platform for growth but also greater diversification. Our participation in a wide range of markets protects the business from crop size fluctuations in any particular market.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, EMEA, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific (including China and India) represented 52%, 24%, 15% and 9% of sales, respectively. The acquisition of Tecnidex meaningfully contributed to our global diversification.
Service-Oriented Business Model Creates Sustainable Competitive Advantages. AgroFresh’s direct service model provides better margins than the industry average, and comprises not only product applications but also mission-critical technical advisory services. Our sales and technical support personnel maintain direct interaction with our customers in areas of contract negotiations and overall customer service. Furthermore, we currently have 40 dedicated research and development scientists, about half with advanced degrees, working across seven global AgroFresh locations, numerous research institutes, and customer sites. This infrastructure has allowed us to amass a proprietary database of technical data of plant physiology collected across our 20+ year history. In 2018 alone, we made over 38,000 monitored applications of SmartFresh. Our proprietary database gives us unique insights into the causes of produce spoilage for various crops varieties in different regions as well as best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh. As a result, our local sales and technical service teams are best positioned to provide bespoke advice and solutions, giving our customers “peace of mind” between and during harvest season.
We believe FreshCloud can further bolster our integrated offerings with the addition of data-backed solutions for the monitoring of produce quality across the supply chain. FreshCloud is designed to deliver timely, predictive insights that will ultimately help our customers improve efficiency and enhance produce freshness. We believe that our direct service model, extensive technical know-how, and brand loyalty differentiate us from competitors and sustain our competitive strengths.
Strong Momentum and Growth Opportunities across the Produce Supply Chain. We believe there are significant growth opportunities to expand and diversify our business, supported by our track record of new product introductions, market penetration, and mergers and acquisition (“M&A”) execution. One key initiative is increased penetration of existing technologies in current and new geographic markets. While many apple growers and packers in the U.S. have adopted SmartFresh, there is potential for further growth. The market penetration of apples treated with SmartFresh has been growing internationally but remains below the levels achieved in the U.S. In recent years, we have concentrated our efforts on
Table of Contents

 accelerating penetration of SmartFresh in other crops like pears outside of the U.S. SmartFresh is also effective on crops such as plums, kiwifruit, persimmons and avocados. Harvista is another key product where we are actively working to expand geographic adoption. As of December 31, 2018, Harvista is registered in seven countries and we are currently working to obtain registrations in ten additional countries. Recently, we received regulatory approval to apply Harvista to cherry crops in the U.S. and to blueberries in Chile and our team is working to achieve similar registrations in other markets. The main limitation to accelerated growth of Harvista is the long regulatory approval cycle in important markets like the European Union and Brazil.
In North America, we are partnering with Del Monte to increase the adoption of RipeLock at the retail level. RipeLock is currently used in approximately 1,800 grocery stores, and we believe that Del Monte’s extensive retail distribution network will prove invaluable in expanding RipeLock’s market share. We have further augmented our crop solutions portfolio through our 2017 acquisition of Tecnidex. Tecnidex successfully strengthened our product portfolio by adding fungicides, sanitizers, waxes, and coatings, diversified our crop exposure, reduced revenue seasonality, and provided new growth opportunities via cross-pollination of Tecnidex technologies for AgroFresh core fruit categories. As a result of all these initiatives, we have successfully diversified our proportion of sales attributable to apples from nearly 90% in July 2015 down to approximately 70% as of December 31, 2018. 
Building on these growth initiatives, we are continuously leveraging our research and development (“R&D”) capabilities to commercialize new products for currently unserved markets. In addition to our internally-developed R&D, M&A is another key strategy to enhance our value proposition to drive growth. Our recent acquisition of Verigo adds to the FreshCloud platform the ability to provide Transit Insights and enables us to incorporate our proprietary produce knowledge into a complementary data service offering. FreshCloud introduces a whole new level of data insights to the produce market from plant physiology to supply chain optimization, which can augment our existing portfolio of treatments and technical advisory services. Utilizing our global footprint and extensive research and development capabilities, we will seek to continue to expand the business through further penetration, increased applicability of existing products, and the commercialization of new preservation solutions.
Long-Standing Relationships with Highly Diverse Customer Base. We believe our direct service model coupled with our proprietary solutions have helped us develop deep, trusted and long-tenured relationships with a diverse array of global customers including packers, growers, and retailers. For more than a decade, we have operated a large team of commercial and technical experts located in key geographies around the world to provide on-site and bespoke advisory services. This infrastructure helps us maintain intimate and consistent interaction with our customers throughout the year to understand all aspects of harvest operations, address a variety of customer-specific issues, and ultimately improve the economics for growers, packers, and retailers across the supply chain. As a result of our unique service model and comprehensive solutions, we have cultivated over 3,900 direct customer relationships in more than 50 countries with no single customer representing more than 10% of total sales. We have also started some strategic customer relationships as a way to penetrate new geographies and markets. An example is our collaboration with Pagoda, the largest fruit retailer in China, where we plan to open an innovation center tasked with developing solutions to extend freshness specifically to meet the unique needs of the Chinese supply chain.
High Profit Margins, Strong, and Consistent Cash Flow Generation. Our technical expertise, long-standing customer relationships, and asset-light business model drive attractive, sustainable profit margins. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated gross margins and EBITDA margins of 74% and 30%, respectively1. In addition, we employ an “asset-light”, outsourced production model. We use a single third-party manufacturer for our key active ingredient, 1-MCP, under a long-term contract with strict confidentiality obligations, to manufacture, and several other suppliers to formulate products and provide packaging services. For the manufacturing of waxes, sanitizers, and equipment servicing the citrus market, we have a combination of a manufacturing plant and several suppliers to formulate products and assemble equipment. As a result, our manufacturing footprint requires minimal capital investment and manufacturing personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures were $3.3 million, or 1.9% of net sales.  Our attractive margin profile coupled with our asset-light solutions result in free cash flow generation, which will be used to reinvest in the business and repay debt. 
Strong Management Team with Deep Industry Experience. Our management team has extensive food, agricultural and chemical industry experience and a proven track record of bringing innovative, value-added solutions to customers and markets around the world. The Company’s management team boasts over 125 years of combined relevant industry experience and is led by Jordi Ferre, our chief executive officer, who has over 25 years of experience in global food operations and manufacturing.
1 EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information, and for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss).
Table of Contents

During the past several years, our management team has effectively launched new products, established new partnerships across the supply chain and completed successful acquisitions of Verigo and majority control of Tecnidex. Following a period of gradual transition from Dow's operating systems, our management team has also successfully transitioned the Company onto a fully autonomous enterprise resource planning system, completing the final milestone in our establishment as a fully operational, independent company. Supported by a deep bench of professionals and a track record of execution, we believe our management team has the vision, expertise, and experience to position us for continued success and to implement our business and growth strategies.
Industry Overview

Food Preservation and Freshness

According to the FAO, over 1.3 billion tons of food, or approximately one third of the total food produced worldwide, is lost to spoilage or waste each year, including food valued at an estimated $48.3 billion in the U.S. alone. An October 2013 TESCO Consumer Study found that nearly 45% of all fresh fruits and vegetables, including 40% of apples and 20% of bananas, are lost to spoilage. Loss or shrinkage along the food supply chain has a variety of causes, including degradation of fresh produce during storage and transportation.
Food waste is a major economic cost for retailers. A large percentage of food waste at the retail level is based on qualitative factors related to consumer perception of freshness. A consumer survey conducted by Oliver Wyman and Ipsos Interactive in the U.S. in 2007 indicated that freshness is the most important driver of customer satisfaction with a store’s produce department.

Near-Harvest Treatments

Near-harvest treatments commonly used to increase the value of crops and reduce harvest losses include the use of
“plant growth regulators” (“PGRs”). PGRs influence the rate of growth or development of crops or affect their reaction to stress events such as harsh weather. PGRs interact with the biochemical make-up of the plant and work by mimicking or blocking the production of naturally occurring plant hormones, like ethylene. Blocking the production of ethylene allows a grower to slow down the maturation of fruit to achieve better control over the timing of harvest. PGRs have a range of effectiveness depending on factors such as environmental conditions and the timing of application. We consider applications in the orchard as “near-harvest” since they are applied right before the fruit is harvested and have synergistic effect with our post-harvest solutions.

Post-Harvest Treatments

Post-harvest treatments to maximize quality and reduce loss include treatments to manage the effects of ethylene and to prevent microbial contamination. Naturally occurring ethylene triggers the acceleration of ripening in certain crops which results in a reduction of post-harvest life.
One class of post-harvest treatments enhances quality and reduces losses by controlling the environment in which produce is stored. Controlled Atmosphere ("CA") and Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere (“DCA”) systems are used to keep stored crops within their optimal ranges of temperature and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Specific oxygen and carbon dioxide levels can lower respiration in fresh produce and delay ripening. CA systems have been used for many decades with fruits and vegetables to preserve freshness. DCA, a more recent innovation, seeks to adjust levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide dynamically as the produce in storage breathes and matures. CA and DCA are only effective at preserving freshness while the fruit is kept in cold storage. However, 1-MCP treatments have been found to be complementary to these technologies by helping to better maintain the quality of apples and pears during cold storage and maintaining freshness for up to 90 days after they are removed from cold storage.

Our Business

We are an agricultural innovator in proprietary advanced technologies that enhance the freshness, quality, and value of fresh produce. We currently offer SmartFresh applications at customer sites predominately through a direct service model utilizing third-party contractors. We also provide advisory services based on our extensive knowledge on the use of 1-MCP collected through thousands of monitored applications done as a part of the service model. Our pricing to customers is based on the service provided, not on the product sold. We operate in over 50 countries and derive the majority of our revenue working with customers to protect the value of apples, pears and other produce during storage. We offer Harvista in the U.S., Argentina, Turkey, Israel, Chile and South Africa. LandSpring is being marketed primarily in the U.S. and RipeLock is being marketed mainly in the U.S., Europe and Australia. ActiMist was launched in the U.S. and is being expanded into other countries subject
Table of Contents

 to regulatory approval. Line extensions and new services are planned for introduction to seek to strengthen our global position in post-harvest storage and to capitalize on adjacent growth opportunities in near-harvest markets.
AgroFresh has extended its post-harvest leadership with the acquisition of Tecnidex, a leading provider of fungicides, sanitizers, waxes, and coatings primarily focused on the citrus market. For over 35 years, Tecnidex has been helping fruit and vegetable producers offer clean, safe and high-quality products to customers in 18 countries with particular strength in the Mediterranean region. Tecnidex brought a broad catalogue of solutions that enhanced our fungicide offering, ActiMist, an innovative delivery system of foggable fungicides. Our fungicide offerings further diversify our revenue by expanding our ability to provide solutions and service to the citrus industry.
1-MCP, the active ingredient in SmartFresh, LandSpring, Harvista and RipeLock, is an ethylene action inhibitor with a proven ability to maintain freshness and extend the shelf life of certain fresh produce. The 1-MCP molecule is structurally similar to ethylene, a naturally occurring plant hormone that occurs in certain fruits and vegetables. Ethylene helps produce grow and ripen, but eventually causes over-ripening and spoilage. 1-MCP works by blocking the ethylene receptors in plant cells, which temporarily delays the ripening process, enabling the produce to better maintain the qualities associated with freshness.
Fruits and vegetables are classified as climacteric or non-climacteric, a term referring to the process of fruit maturation. The climacteric event is a stage of fruit ripening associated with higher ethylene production and changes in the fruit including pigment changes and sugar release. The climacteric event marks the peak of edible ripeness, with fruits having the best taste and texture for consumption. The role of SmartFresh is to delay the onset of the climacteric stage until the product is ready for consumption. Apples, pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmon, bananas, melons, peaches, and tomatoes are examples of climacteric fruit. The Company continues to evaluate the commercial value of 1-MCP with a range of other climacteric fruit.
SmartFresh Value Proposition
SmartFresh, our current principal solution, preserves the texture, firmness, taste and appearance of produce during storage, transportation and retail display. It allows growers and packers to deliver “just harvested” freshness on a year-round basis and enables retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh value proposition is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities together with mission-critical and value-added advisory services.
The value of SmartFresh with any crop is determined by both the biological efficacy with that crop and the utility value the application delivers to the customer. The biological efficacy with apples is high; apples are sensitive to ethylene and SmartFresh is effective at delaying ripening. In addition, SmartFresh brings high utility value by helping to keep apples fresh year-round despite their limited harvest window. This has resulted in the widespread adoption of SmartFresh by apple growers and packers throughout the world. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples, which is small relative to both the value of the crop and the importance of maintaining the quality of that crop during storage. Retail prices of apples in the U.S. typically range from $1.30-$4.50 per pound depending on the variety. The use of SmartFresh gives growers and packers the ability to store apples from one season to the next without losing their just picked quality characteristics.
Beneficial effects of SmartFresh have been proven across numerous apple varieties throughout the world. SmartFresh is also effective with other crops that are highly sensitive to ethylene, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmons, avocados, and flowers, the latter marketed under the EthylBloc brand name through two strategic partners that have a strong position in the global flower market.
AgroFresh’s business historically has been highly seasonal, driven by the timing of apple harvests in the northern and southern hemispheres. The first half of the year is when the southern hemisphere harvest occurs, and the second half of the year is when the northern hemisphere harvest occurs. Since the northern hemisphere harvest of our two core crops of apples and pears is typically larger, a significant portion of our sales and profits are historically generated in the second half of the year. In addition to this seasonality, factors such as weather patterns may impact the timing of the harvest within the two halves of the year. Crop diversification is an important way to achieve balanced revenues across the year, and the ability to service the citrus segment provides an opportunity for the Company to increase revenue in the fourth and first quarters, which are the two strongest quarters for citrus crops. Our recent acquisition of a controlling interest in Tecnidex and an increased presence in the citrus category should moderately reduce the current concentration of sales in the second half of the year.
SmartFresh Service Model

We believe that we have developed deep, trusted relationships with our customers by combining our effective SmartFresh product with application expertise and trusted advisory services. Over the past decade we have amassed a valuable proprietary database of technical information on the best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh on a wide range of apple and pear
Table of Contents

 varieties, since each fruit and fruit variety requires a different treatment protocol. The advisory services component utilizes this information to help maximize the profitability of our customers’ operations. 
Harvista

Complementing our post-harvest solutions, Harvista is used for near harvest management of pome fruit, apples, pears, cherries and blueberries. Our Harvista product line includes proprietary 1-MCP formulations that are specifically designed to slow ripening, reduce fruit drop, and hold fruit on the tree longer to promote better color and fruit size, thereby bringing new benefits to the grower. With maximum flexibility in application timing, it extends the harvest window by allowing growers to factor in ever-changing weather conditions and labor availability, providing peace of mind. We have found that the combination of Harvista in the orchard and SmartFresh in the storage room results in improved fruit quality metrics compared to use of either product individually.
Harvista extends the “ideal harvest window,” for up to an additional 14 days. This added flexibility creates significant benefits both in terms of harvest logistics and crop profitability. Widening the harvest window allows for better scheduling and the optimization of limited resources, such as harvest crews and equipment. Overall, the value of the crop is enhanced by bigger average fruit size, better color, and fewer defects.
We offer Harvista for apples, pears, cherries and blueberries through a pre-scheduled application service including aerial and/or ground applications. Typically, our technical staff designs the protocol in consultation with the customer, and either a third-party service provider or the customer makes the application. 
Harvista is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Turkey, Argentina, Israel, Chile, Australia, and South Africa, and the Company is currently compiling data for registrations in ten more countries, which are expected to be granted on a country by country basis over the next five years. In 2017, we received regulatory approval to apply Harvista to cherries in the U.S. and blueberries in Chile. Additional registrations and label expansions are expected to be pursued as new formulations and/or crop concepts are validated.
RipeLock

For many crops, a significant amount of shrinkage occurs at retail. This includes bananas, the largest retail fruit category. According to data from the Journal of Consumer Affairs and United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization, it is estimated that 12-16% of banana loss occurs after the fruit reaches the grocery store. Our RipeLock Quality System is a retail solution to improve the quality and consumer appeal of bananas. RipeLock is an innovative fruit quality management system specifically designed for the banana industry. RipeLock enables retailers to offer consumers bananas that are in better condition and maintain the consumer-preferred color and firmness longer, reducing waste and increasing sales. The patented RipeLock system combines a specially-engineered, micro-perforated form of Modified Atmosphere Packaging (“MAP”) and our proprietary 1-MCP formulation. The combination of MAP with 1-MCP provides greater control over the ripening progression of bananas during shipping, distribution, on and display. We believe that bananas handled with RipeLock technology retain their bright-yellow color, firm texture, fresh taste, and appealing look for approximately another 4-6 days versus untreated bananas. As a result, RipeLock maximizes the marketable “yellow life” of the fruit, providing economic benefits to brand owners and retailers.
FreshCloud
To continue to evolve and increase the value we provide to our customers, we recently launched our FreshCloud suite of produce monitoring and screening solutions. FreshCloud Storage Insights combines proprietary sensor technology and data analytics in the storage room to offer customers real-time access to unique insights into the condition of their stored fruit. FreshCloud Predictive Screening predicts the risk of disorder development during storage by analyzing gene expression at commercial harvest, resulting in more informed storage management decisions. FreshCloud Transit Insights combines sensor technology and proprietary algorithms to provide insights as to the condition and quality of fruit during transit.
LandSpring
LandSpring technology is a PGR for use on seedlings to help them withstand transplanting and other stresses encountered in the field. LandSpring suppresses the ethylene signals that would prompt a stress event in the seedling and reduce growth. Among the number of protective benefits, this technology makes seedlings less sensitive to stresses such as heat, cold, UV radiation, drought, flooding and salinity that often occur after planting. When applied before transplanting, LandSpring results in greater plant vigor and a healthier crop that is better able to withstand adverse environmental conditions and give growers the opportunity to increase yield.

Marketing and Sales
Our success depends on our ability to attract and develop the talent to effectively implement our strategy. In 2018, AgroFresh changed its organizational structure and leadership team to support its strategic growth and diversification objectives. The goal of the organizational change was to consolidate the Company’s core business units under a global general manager while adding leadership and focus to accelerate new business development activities. Over the past year, we have been strengthening and deepening our management organization. In 2018, we hired a vice president and global general manager to lead our post-harvest offerings and a director of global retail solutions to lead the RipeLock commercial opportunities.
The Company's core post-harvest business includes solutions designed to improve the yields of growers and packers. These solutions include SmartFresh, ActiMist, FreshCloud Storage Insights, FreshCloud Predictive Screening and a large range of fungicides, waxes, and coatings, marketed under the brands Textar and Teycer, respectively.
Integration of Tecnidex progressed very well in 2018, with all functional departments now aligned with AgroFresh’s global structure, including consolidation of all sales teams, and we are preparing to implement SAP across the Tecnidex organization in the second quarter of 2019.
The technical sales support group supports the sales team and runs customer-specific trials for local crop varieties or specialized storage and distribution conditions and conducts follow-up with customers. This team works closely with customers to provide advice on appropriate protocols for SmartFresh, Harvista and other product applications depending on crop, variety, region, and climatic conditions. The technical sales support group draws on our extensive knowledge base of 1-MCP applications across all regions and conditions.
Marketing and communications functions are organized on a global and regional basis. The regional teams manage the core post-harvest business's marketing needs, while the Global marketing department is responsible for corporate brand stewardship and communications, as well as serving as a center of excellence to support all product launches, advertising and trade shows. The teams reach out to customers to keep them up to date on the latest research and news about AgroFresh products. Market research, including product penetration, collecting competitive intelligence and tracking other relevant market and industry information, is managed globally in conjunction with the regional teams.

No single customer accounted for more than 3% of net sales in 2018, 2017, or 2016.

Competition

We estimate the size of the core post-harvest market to be approximately $500 million on a global basis. The post-harvest solutions offered include 1-MCP-based solutions, fungicides and coatings, representing approximately 36%, 20% and 24% of the total market, respectively. The market for the use of 1-MCP is evolving and we have faced growing competition since the expiration of the 1-MCP use patent in 2014. We estimate that citrus applications represent approximately 60% of the total core post-harvest market, which is why we are focused on seeking to grow in this important crop segment. The market for post-harvest solutions is fragmented with various regional suppliers. Including AgroFresh, there are three leading providers with global reach that account for about two thirds of global post-harvest sales. Other regional players, mainly in citrus, account for approximately another 20% of post-harvest sales. Other key players in the post-harvest industry include fungicide suppliers such as Syngenta and Janssen PMP who hold post-harvest registrations of fungicides previously approved for pre-harvest applications. In the near-harvest segment, ReTainTM is a competitive technology to Harvista that is offered by Valent in all regions except for the European Union. We believe that the principal factors of competition in our industry include reputation, product quality, customer service and customer intimacy, product innovation, technical service and value creation. We believe that we compete favorably with competitors on the basis of these and other factors. See the subsection titled “Competitive Strengths” above.
Research and Development

Research and development plays an important role at AgroFresh in supporting customers as well as developing line extensions and new products. Research and development is a truly global function with less than half of our R&D resources are located in facilities in North America, with the remainder across the other regions. Approximately 30% of our research and development resources are third-party contractors. During fruit harvest times (August to November in the Northern Hemisphere and late January to early May in the Southern Hemisphere), we hire additional third-party contract scientists to assist AgroFresh in the execution of experiments involving Harvista, SmartFresh, and FreshCloud technologies. Most of the regional research and development facilities focus on business aligned research and development initiatives to develop line extensions and create new products. Research and development makes use of core competencies in a number of technical areas including post-harvest

 physiology, analytical chemistry, regulatory sciences, regulatory affairs, formulation science, formulation process development, organic chemistry, and delivery systems. Initiatives focused on next generation solutions utilize expertise in material science, molecular biology, post-harvest pathology, diagnostics and sensor technology.
Intellectual Property

We are a technology-based solutions provider and, as such, rely on a combination of important intellectual property strengths, including licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, service providers and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential including, but not limited to, information related to our proprietary manufacturing process and SmartFresh service model. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property and/or our products protected by our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements.
We obtained an exclusive license from North Carolina State University under the Sisler patent (U.S. 5,518,988) for the use of 1-MCP to delay ripening of fruit and flowers. This patent has expired in the United States and Europe and continues only in Japan until May of 2020. We also acquired the Daly patent (U.S. 6,017,849) for the encapsulation complex of 1-MCP and alpha-cyclodextrin, used as the foundational component in SmartFresh and Harvista. Depending on the country, SmartFresh is currently protected by a patent for the encapsulation complex through 2019. Today a majority of our SmartFresh applications use ProTabsTM, an application method patented through 2022, and we continue to invest in application technologies as a means to continue to facilitate an even better service to our customers. We have also generated an impressive portfolio of intellectual property with over 30 patents granted in at least one country (pending in other countries) covering 1-MCP and next generation technologies, most of which do not expire until 2025 or beyond. RipeLock and Harvista formulations are patent protected through at least 2027.
Regulation and Compliance

We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulation, and the Company has a regulatory team that we believe is best in class, which leverages a global network of highly-experienced regulatory consultants. Through this network, we have successfully obtained registrations for SmartFresh, Harvista, RipeLock, and LandSpring in every country where the review process has been completed, and the registration process for Harvista continues in many additional countries. We have completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista are safe for consumers, workers, and the environment. 1-MCP, the active ingredient in the AgroFresh products, is metabolized by the natural processes in apples and other fruits and leaves no residue. The products have been approved by over 50 authorities including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission. We do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining future required licenses, permits or approvals that are necessary to expand our business. We leverage our regulatory capabilities as we expand the fungicide product lines into new countries. 
For a discussion of the various risks we may face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 285 full-time employees. None of our employees in North America are members of a union or subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. In certain other countries where we operate (including Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain), employees are members of unions or are represented by works councils. In addition, certain of our activities have been performed historically by seasonal and part-time third-party contingent staff.
