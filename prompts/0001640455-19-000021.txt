Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer by developing therapies that enable the immune system to attack tumors and provide long-lasting benefits to patients. We have developed a suite of integrated technologies that comprise our Translational Science Platform, enabling us to comprehensively interrogate the cellular and molecular composition of tumors. By focusing on specific cell types, both immune and non-immune, within tumors, we can prioritize targets and then identify related biomarkers designed to match the right therapy to the right patient. Through this scientific understanding of the tumor microenvironment, or TME, our goal is to effectively and efficiently identify and develop new cancer immunotherapies designed to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from highly inflamed, or “hot,” to poorly inflamed, or “cold,” and especially those not well served by current therapies.
Our most advanced product candidate, vopratelimab (formerly JTX-2011), is a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator, or ICOS, a protein on the surface of certain T cells commonly found in many solid tumors. Vopratelimab was assessed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we refer to as ICONIC. In the initial Phase 1/2 portion of ICONIC, vopratelimab was found to be safe and well-tolerated, both alone and in combination with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody. At the June 2018 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, we reported Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, responses and other tumor reductions as determined by investigator assessment that were associated with an ICOS pharmacodynamic biomarker. We subsequently reported that these responses were durable, lasting six or more months and that all responders, as determined by investigator assessments, remained on study for more than one year. ICONIC also includes an on-going dose-escalation Phase 1 portion to assess vopratelimab in combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and in combination with ipilimumab, an antibody that binds to CTLA-4 on certain T cells. This Phase 1 portion established the safety of vopratelimab in combination with each of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. We plan to initiate additional Phase 2 clinical studies, including one or more new dosing schedules and combination sequences, in 2019 and expect to report preliminary efficacy data from these additional clinical studies in 2020. These anticipated Phase 2 clinical studies will evaluate vopratelimab in combination with ipilimumab, and, separately, using a predictive biomarker approach, will evaluate vopratelimab alone and/or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. These additional clinical studies are designed to determine whether vopratelimab can offer a treatment alternative to patients who otherwise do not display an effective response to currently approved therapies, and/or whether it can enhance the therapeutic benefit of currently approved therapies.
Our second product candidate, JTX-4014, is a clinical-stage anti-PD-1 antibody that we are developing primarily for potential use in combination with future product candidates, as we believe that combination therapy has the potential to be a mainstay of cancer immunotherapy. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of JTX‑4014 monotherapy and completed enrollment in the first cohort in the fourth quarter of 2018. This Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to assess safety and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. We expect to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose in 2019. 
JTX-8064, our third product candidate, is an antibody that binds to LILRB2, which is a cell surface receptor expressed on macrophages. JTX-8064 is the first tumor-associated macrophage candidate to emerge from our Translational Science Platform. We believe therapies targeting these innate immune cells may have the potential to benefit patients with tumors that are less likely to respond to existing T cell-focused approaches. We are currently conducting IND-enabling activities for JTX-8064, with the goal of filing an investigational new drug application, or IND, and initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019. 
Our strategy is to use a biomarker-driven approach from discovery through clinical development. We leverage our Translational Science Platform to interrogate cell types within the human tumor microenvironment and to identify and prioritize targets across a broad spectrum of immune and non-immune cell types. In addition, early in the development process, we use our Translational Science Platform to identify potential predictive biomarkers to enable us to enrich our clinical trials for patient populations that may be more likely to respond to a particular immunotherapy. We can also use characteristics defined by our biomarker efforts to focus on niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications to inform our clinical strategy. Once clinical data is available for a product candidate, we then use a reverse translational approach to interrogate tumor and blood samples from patients with known outcomes. By using these reverse translational findings, we believe we are better able to design clinical trials and more efficiently develop cancer immunotherapies that potentially provide greater benefit to patients. We believe that the biomarker results, coordinated

to clinical response, will assist with determining the utility of proceeding to the use of a complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic for a given therapy.
We have assembled a highly-experienced internal and external team of experts in immunotherapy to help us leverage our Translational Science Platform to drive the development of our early discovery programs and our product candidates, including vopratelimab. Two of our founders, Dr. James Allison and Dr. Padmanee Sharma of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, were initially responsible for the translational science behind ICOS. Dr. Allison played a fundamental role in ushering in the era of immune checkpoint therapy, including contributing to the understanding of the basic science of CTLA-4 that supported the development of ipilimumab, marketed as Yervoy. In 2018, Dr. Allison was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work related to the discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.
Our ability to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers using our Translational Science Platform helped lead to our strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. This global strategic collaboration, which included a $225.0 million upfront payment and a $36.1 million equity investment, is primarily focused on co-developing and co-commercializing innovative biologic immunotherapy treatments for patients with cancer. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, vopratelimab, and up to four early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets, including JTX-8064. Additionally, Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared program that may be used by both parties within and outside of the collaboration. Under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four-year research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn up to approximately $2.6 billion in clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments, option-exercise fees and research term extension fees. In January 2019, Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, announced that they had entered into an agreement under which Celgene will be acquired by BMS, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. If the transaction closes, we anticipate that the acquisition of Celgene by BMS may change the dynamics of our collaboration, given the overlap of our product candidates and therapies in BMS’s pipeline. We expect that the acquisition may have a positive impact on our business if we successfully develop a relationship with BMS, a leader in the immuno-oncology field. In the event that BMS or Celgene chooses not to exercise some or all of the rights to the optioned programs, we will retain one hundred percent of the worldwide rights for the non-optioned programs and may advance them on our own or potentially with a new partner. In addition to progressing collaboration programs, we will continue to use our Translational Science Platform to progress our own programs that are not part of the collaboration and for which we retain worldwide commercial rights.
Our Strategy
We aim to build a multi-product company that discovers, develops and commercializes first-in-class and/or best in class novel therapeutics and combination approaches for patients who are less likely to respond, or who have experienced limited or no response, to currently-approved immunotherapies. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Aggressively develop our product candidates, and potential future product candidates, using a biomarker-driven approach and reverse translational analysis aimed at bringing the right immunotherapy to the right patients;


• | Continue our investment in our Translational Science Platform to enhance our understanding of the TME, as we look to broaden the benefit of immunotherapy through targeting additional cell types;


• | Address the unmet need of cancer patients with tumors unresponsive to T effector cell-directed therapies by focusing our discovery efforts on other cell types within the TME; and


• | Expand our pipeline by leveraging our internal discovery platform and/or in-licensing new technologies, product candidates and methodologies.

Immuno-Oncology Overview
Historically, cancer treatments have focused on either killing or arresting the proliferation of the tumor cells themselves. However, fundamental work pioneered by one of our founders, Dr. Allison, led to the discovery of one of the first immune cell checkpoint therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in treating various cancers, including immunotherapies that bind to the PD-1 or PD-L1 receptor on certain T cells, and are approved in multiple cancer types and across different lines of therapy.

Even with the success of these antibodies that bind to PD-1 or PD-L1, known as PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, there is still a significant unmet need. Data emerging from clinical studies with these PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors suggests the importance of a biomarker-driven patient-enrichment strategy, like that used for pembrolizumab, in first-line non-small cell lung cancer subjects and in second line microsatellite-instability-high, or MSI-H, cancer patient populations. Additional highlights of the evolving immunotherapy landscape include longer-lasting responses as compared to chemotherapy and that these longer-lasting responses can be improved with combination therapy.
The interplay between the immune system and cancer is dynamic and as more patients, in an expanded set of indications, are being exposed to cancer immunotherapies we are learning about the factors that may contribute to a lack of response or a failed response. Reasons for resistance to immunotherapy may include a lack of appropriate immune cells in the TME, for example, the absence of T effector cells, or the presence of immunosuppressive cells, such as tumor associated macrophages or T regulatory cells. In these cases, therapeutic approaches that target other cell types within the TME to convert colder tumors to hot tumors may broaden the applicability of cancer immunotherapies. In addition, a tumor may initially respond to a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, but other immune checkpoints may emerge or an acquired resistance to the particular immunotherapy may occur, for example through genetic alterations in key T cell signaling pathways. In these instances, combination therapy approaches that target more than one checkpoint, or more than one mechanism, may be key to maximizing the benefit of cancer immunotherapies.
We believe that our Translational Science Platform, which enables both the identification and prioritization of targets across a broad spectrum of immune and non-immune cell types and the identification of potential biomarkers to inform our clinical development strategy, may position us to address multiple pathways and indications, including those that may be important in colder tumors, and to identify the most appropriate indications and most responsive patient populations for our new immunotherapies. By taking this dual approach, we believe we may be able to address areas of unmet need, particularly in the combination setting.
The promise of long-lasting benefit to cancer patients has led to heightened enthusiasm for these types of immunotherapy products and the rapid expansion of the market opportunity. The overall market for immunotherapy is expected to expand over the next five years, with 2024 market size estimates ranging from $41 billion to $58 billion across solid and blood-based tumors according to market reports. 
Our Product Pipeline
We are developing a pipeline of immunotherapies that we believe will provide a meaningful and long-lasting benefit to cancer patients. We plan to develop each of these as a single agent and/or in combination with other therapies, as applicable. The following table depicts our current pipeline:

Development Programs
Lead Program Vopratelimab: An Anti-ICOS Monoclonal Antibody Immunotherapy
Our most advanced product candidate, vopratelimab, is a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates ICOS, a protein on the surface of certain T cells commonly found in many solid tumors. Vopratelimab was assessed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we refer to as ICONIC. In the initial Phase 1/2 portion of ICONIC, vopratelimab was found to be safe and well-tolerated, both alone and in combination with nivolumab. ICONIC also includes an on-going dose-escalation Phase 1 portion to assess the safety of vopratelimab in combination with each of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. We plan to initiate additional Phase 2 clinical studies, including one or more new dosing schedules and combination sequences, in 2019, and expect to report preliminary efficacy data from these additional clinical studies in 2020. These anticipated Phase 2 clinical studies are designed to evaluate vopratelimab in combination with ipilimumab in patients who have previously received a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy and who have either non-small cell lung cancer or bladder cancer, and, separately, using a predictive biomarker approach, to evaluate vopratelimab alone and/or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with multiple tumor types. These trials aim to determine whether vopratelimab can offer a treatment alternative to patients who otherwise do not display an effective response to currently approved therapies, and/or whether it can enhance the therapeutic benefit of currently approved therapies.
At the June 2018 ASCO annual meeting, we presented preliminary efficacy data and safety data from ICONIC, comprised of data across multiple tumor types from all evaluable patients as of April 4, 2018. Patients were heavily pre-treated, with approximately 65 percent having received three or more prior therapies and approximately 65 percent discontinuing during the first three cycles. In gastric cancer, a RECIST partial response with vopratelimab monotherapy was observed in one of eight Phase 2 patients, and two RECIST partial responses with vopratelimab plus nivolumab were observed in one of four Phase 1 patients and one of 28 Phase 2 patients. In triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, a RECIST partial response with vopratelimab plus nivolumab was observed in one of 17 Phase 2 patients. All RECIST partial responses were based on investigator assessments and were observed in patients who had not previously received a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Additionally, based on investigator assessments, tumor reductions were observed in eight of 28 Phase 2 gastric cancer patients treated with vopratelimab plus nivolumab, in two of 17 Phase 2 TNBC patients treated with vopratelimab plus nivolumab, in one of 16 Phase 2 head and neck squamous cell cancer patients treated with vopratelimab plus nivolumab and in four of 12 Phase 2 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with vopratelimab plus nivolumab. Preliminary signals of clinical activity with vopratelimab monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab were observed, accompanied by an ICOS pharmacodynamic biomarker, specifically the emergence of CD4 T cells in the peripheral blood with a high expression of ICOS per T cell, which we refer to as ICOS hi CD4 T cells. All responses, as determined by investigator assessments, have been durable lasting six or more months, and all responders, as determined by investigator assessments, remained on study for more than one year. Additionally, vopratelimab was well tolerated alone and in combination with nivolumab, and the overall safety profile observed was consistent with data from ICONIC previously reported at the 2017 ASCO annual meeting. In the first half of 2019, we expect to provide incremental data from ICONIC, as well as an update on overall survival data and progression-free survival data, and their relationship to the emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells. 
Consistent with the inducible nature of ICOS, data from Drs. Sharma and Allison and others suggest that ICOS can be upregulated on T cells following exposure to certain agents, such as ipilimumab, and our ex vivo studies indicate that a high expression of ICOS per T cell is necessary for vopratelimab to drive the activation of T effector cells. Through reverse translational analysis, we believe we have identified an association between the emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells and clinical response to vopratelimab. We conducted an analysis of the populations of CD4 T cells in the blood of a subset of ICONIC patients with evaluable samples that demonstrated the emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells in all patients who had a target lesion reduction of 30 percent or greater, and that the emergence of these cells was not detectable in patients with target lesion progression. This subset of patients included those treated with vopratelimab monotherapy, as well as vopratelimab in combination with nivolumab. In order to examine the possible role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in the emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells, we conducted a separate study of blood samples from responding and non-responding patients who received PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy treatment. In this study, no emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells was observed, suggesting that the emergence of this cell population is attributable to activity of vopratelimab. Furthermore, in an ex vivo study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, PBMCs from healthy donors were stimulated and divided into ICOS hi and ICOS lo CD4 T cell populations and then treated with vopratelimab. This ex vivo data demonstrated that vopratelimab induced a polyfunctional cytokine response only in the ICOS hi CD4 T cells and not in the ICOS lo CD4 T cells, suggesting that combining vopratelimab with agents that induce ICOS hi CD4 T cells, such as ipilimumab, may increase proliferation and activity of these cells, which may lead to clinical benefit in a greater number of patients. 
6

Based on our reverse translation work, clinical studies along two development paths are planned for vopratelimab in 2019. Specifically, we intend to combine ipilimumab, an agent that induces ICOS hi CD4 T cells, with vopratelimab to potentially induce a population of ICOS hi CD4 T cells that may be more likely to respond when treated with vopratelimab. In addition, we plan to assess vopratelimab as a monotherapy and/or in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, and we anticipate selecting patients using potential predictive biomarkers that were identified by analyzing baseline blood and tumor samples from patients treated in ICONIC and comparing baseline samples from patients who had emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells and those who did not.
JTX-4014: An Anti-PD-1 Antibody for Combination Therapy
Combination therapy aimed at multiple targets has become an important element of immunotherapy development efforts with the goal of creating even better, long-lasting responses. PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors are anticipated to play a key role in combination therapies. For this reason, we are developing our own anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014, primarily for use in combinations with potential future product candidates. We believe this will give us greater flexibility to develop our pipeline of therapies. 
We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of JTX-4014 monotherapy and completed enrollment in the first cohort in the fourth quarter of 2018. This Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to assess safety and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of JTX-4014. We expect to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose in 2019. 
JTX-8064: An Anti-LILRB2 Monoclonal Antibody Immunotherapy
In early 2018, we commenced IND-enabling activities for JTX-8064, a monoclonal antibody binding to LILRB2. JTX-8064 is the first potential candidate to emerge from our macrophage-focused efforts, and we have generated encouraging in vitro data and ex vivo data using human tumor histoculture. 
Immunosuppressive macrophages are highly prevalent in many solid tumor types and their presence is associated with poorer disease prognosis. Therefore, we prioritized macrophage targets for our initial foray into developing more effective cancer therapies to address the unmet needs of patients with tumors that are less likely to respond to existing therapeutic approaches that focus on T effector cells alone. Using our Translational Science Platform, we identified LILRB2 as a potential macrophage checkpoint. When LILRB2 binds to its ligands, such as HLA-G, an immunosuppressive state is created. Like other important immune checkpoints, PD-L1 and CTLA-4, HLA-G has been shown to play a key role in fetal-maternal tolerance and thus may also represent an important immune evasion strategy employed by tumors. By inhibiting the binding of LILRB2 to its ligands, we hope to release the brakes on this immunosuppressive interaction, resulting in a reprogramming of the macrophages from an immuno-suppressive, or M2, phenotype to immuno-stimulatory, or M1, phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced microbicidal or tumorcidal capacity and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Our goal is to convert, but not deplete, immune-suppressing M2 macrophages to immune-enhancing M1 macrophages, thus engaging the innate immune system in the response to cancer. We expect to file an IND and initiate a Phase 1 trial for JTX-8064 in 2019.
Discovery Programs
With our focus on bringing the right immunotherapy to the right patients, we have invested heavily in our Translational Science Platform as we believe that the systematic interrogation of the immune make-up of human tumors gives us the ability to target different cell types within the TME beyond the T effector cells that are the focus of currently approved immunotherapies. This may enable us to fully exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer by allowing us to pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies that target the T effector arm of the adaptive immune system, as well as potentially convert the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immune activating environment and thereby convert cold tumors to hot tumors.
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas, or TCGA, using our proprietary gene signatures, which represent various immune cells, shows that the immune cell composition of tumors is diverse, both across and within indications, and suggests that a significant number of tumors, including cold tumors in particular, may not benefit from the current T‑cell focused immunotherapies, such as PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.
We are leveraging our Translational Science Platform to systematically and comprehensively interrogate cell types within the TME, including non-immune cells such as stromal cells, with the goal of enabling us to develop therapies to benefit patients with tumors across the hot to cold spectrum. We believe that some of our discovery approaches, including targeting stromal cells, may identify product candidates with the potential to address a significant unmet medical need by turning cold tumors hot and making them amenable to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, such as JTX-4014, and other immunotherapies.

Strategic Alliance with Celgene
In July 2016, we entered into a Master Research and Collaboration Agreement, or the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, with Celgene. The primary goal of the collaboration is to co-develop and co-commercialize innovative biologic immunotherapies that either activate or suppress the immune system by binding to targets identified by leveraging our Translational Science Platform. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, vopratelimab, and up to four early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets, including JTX-8064. Additionally, Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product candidate JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared program that may be used by both parties in and outside of the collaboration. Prior to Celgene exercising an option for a program, we are responsible for all research and development activities for that program under the agreement during the collaboration, and subject to all costs and potential liabilities.
Advancement of biologics: For programs that have biologics that meet mutually agreed criteria for suitability for further development, Celgene may elect that program’s target (solely with respect to immune activation or immune suppression, as applicable) to be added to the pool of targets for which we may conduct further research subject to the terms of the collaboration. If we continue to conduct research and development for such programs, then such activity will be part of the collaboration. If Celgene does not elect a program that achieves such criteria, then we will retain the rights to such program’s targets and biologics and Celgene will not have an option to such program.
Exercise of options and further development of programs: Celgene may extend the initial four-year research term of the collaboration for up to three additional one-year periods upon payment of an extension fee for each additional year. Celgene may exercise its option for a program at any time until the expiration of an option term for that program. For each program, the option term ends 45 to 60 days following Celgene’s receipt of a data package that includes certain information relating to the program’s research and development activities. The data package for a program may be delivered to Celgene after the applicable development milestone for such program has been achieved. Depending on the program, the applicable development milestone is (i) IND acceptance, (ii) availability of certain Phase 1a data, or (iii) availability of certain Phase 1/2 data. If Celgene fails to exercise its option during the option term for a program, we will retain the rights to such program. If Celgene exercises its option for a program other than JTX-4014, then we will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Celgene for such program in substantially the form attached to the agreement as an exhibit. Under the co-development and co-commercialization agreement for vopratelimab and one additional program for which Celgene opts in that is not JTX-4014, we will be responsible for leading development and commercialization activities in the United States and Celgene will be responsible for development and commercialization activities outside the United States. For all other additional programs for which Celgene opts in, other than JTX-4014, Celgene will lead development and commercialization activities worldwide. If Celgene exercises its option for JTX-4014, we will enter into a license agreement, in substantially the form attached to the agreement as an exhibit, pursuant to which we will both be able to equally access JTX-4014 for combinations within our portfolios and with other molecules that are subject to the agreement, subject to joint governance. Once Celgene opts in with respect to a given program, Celgene and we must each use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the corresponding product in the United States.
Governance: The collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee, or JSC, and a joint patent committee. The JSC may establish additional subcommittees to oversee particular projects or activities. Subject to limitations specified in the agreement, if the applicable governance committee is unable to make a decision by consensus and the parties are unable to resolve the issue through escalation to specified senior executive officers of the parties, then we generally have final decision-making authority over research and development matters for programs prior to Celgene’s exercise of its option to such program. If Celgene exercises its option for a program, final decision-making authority for that program is specified in the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement or license agreement.
Exclusivity: During the collaboration’s research term (i.e., for four years plus up to three one-year extensions that Celgene may elect), we may not alone, or with a third party, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize a biologic that binds to a defined pool of B cell, T regulatory cell or tumor-associated macrophage targets that meet certain criteria, termed an exclusive target, and inhibit, activate or otherwise modulate the activity of such exclusive target. In addition, if Celgene exercises its option for a program within the collaboration other than JTX-4014, then until termination or expiration of the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such program, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, any biologic with specified activity against that program’s collaboration target.
Financial terms: Under the terms of the agreements, we received a $225.0 million upfront cash payment and $36.1 million from the sale of 10,448,100 shares of our Series B-1 convertible preferred stock to Celgene, which shares 
8

converted into 2,831,463 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. If Celgene exercises any of its options, then Celgene will pay us an option-exercise fee, the parties will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement or a license agreement that governs the development and commercialization of the applicable program, and we will then split future development and commercialization costs with Celgene in accordance with such agreement. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four-year research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn up to approximately $2.6 billion in clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments, option-exercise fees and research term extension fees. 
The development milestones are payable on initiation of certain clinical trials and range from $32.5 million to $105.0 million, per program, with an aggregate total of $290.0 million. The regulatory approval milestones are payable upon regulatory approval in the United States and outside the United States and range from $7.5 million to $50.0 million per milestone, with an aggregate total of $700.0 million. The commercial milestones are payable upon achievement of specified aggregate product sales outside the United States for each program and range from $40.0 million to $200.0 million per milestone, with an aggregate total of $1.270 billion. We are also eligible to receive royalties on product sales outside the United States ranging from high single digit to mid-teen royalties. As of December 31, 2018, we had not received any option exercise, research term extension, milestone or royalty payments under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement. 
Profit sharing, cost sharing and commercialization rights for products: If Celgene exercises its option for a program, then we will share with Celgene the U.S. profits or losses on such collaboration program as follows:

• | We will retain 60 percent of the U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of vopratelimab, with 40 percent allocated to Celgene.


• | We will retain 25 percent of the U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of the first program, other than vopratelimab or JTX-4014, for which an IND application is filed under the collaboration, with 75 percent allocated to Celgene. Celgene has a one-time right to substitute and swap the economics and governance of this program with that of another program for which it exercises an option (other than vopratelimab and JTX-4014).


• | We and Celgene will equally share U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of up to three additional programs (other than vopratelimab or JTX-4014).


• | We and Celgene will share all development costs, other than for JTX-4014, in accordance with the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement.

If Celgene exercises its option for a program other than JTX-4014, we will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement, pursuant to which Celgene will have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the products arising out of such collaboration program outside of the United States, and we will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from a high single digit to mid-teen percentage rate on net product sales outside of the United States. Under each co-development and co-commercialization agreement, we will also have the right to opt out of profit sharing in the United States and instead receive milestones and royalties.
Furthermore, if Celgene exercises its option for JTX-4014, we will enter into a license agreement, pursuant to which Celgene and we will each have equal rights to develop and commercialize JTX-4014 in combination with other proprietary molecules in their or our respective pipelines or in combination with products arising out of collaboration programs. Subject to terms specified in the license agreement for JTX-4014, the party owning the proprietary molecule that is combined with JTX-4014, if such molecule does not arise from a collaboration program with Celgene, will be solely responsible for all development and commercialization costs related to such combination. If JTX-4014 is combined with a product arising from a collaboration program, then the parties will share costs and, if co-packaged or co-formulated, profits or losses in accordance with the co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such other product.
Intellectual Property: We and Celgene will jointly own any intellectual property that is generated or invented by both parties pursuant to the activities conducted under the collaboration agreement. If Celgene exercises its option for a program, each party will also grant the other party exclusive or co-exclusive licenses, with rights to grant sublicenses, under certain of each party’s intellectual property rights, determined by the nature of the program and the licensed territory.
9

Termination: At any point during the collaboration agreement, including during the research, development and clinical trial process, or during the term of the applicable co-development and co-commercialization or license agreement, respectively, Celgene can terminate the applicable agreement with us in its entirety, or with respect to any program under the collaboration agreement, upon 120 days’ notice and can terminate the entire agreement with us in connection with a material breach of the agreement by us that remains uncured for 90 days.
In January 2019, Celgene and BMS announced that they had entered into an agreement under which Celgene will be acquired by BMS, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.
Manufacturing
We rely on and will continue to rely on our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both drug substance and drug product. While we do not plan to develop our own full-scale manufacturing capabilities, we may consider establishing a small, flexible approach for supporting preclinical IND-enabling studies and early clinical trials. As of now, all of our manufacturing is outsourced to well-established third-party manufacturers. We have entered into long-term contracts with CMOs for drug supply to our vopratelimab, JTX-4014 and JTX-8064 preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidates, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics. Potentially competitive therapies fall primarily into the following groups of treatment:

• | traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy;


• | four clinical-stage anti-ICOS antibody programs in clinical trials, being developed by BMS, GlaxoSmithKline plc and Kymab Group Ltd.;


• | a bispecific anti-ICOS and anti-PD-1 antibody program in clinical development being developed by Xencor, Inc.;


• | approved immunotherapy antibodies, including an approved anti-CTLA 4 antibody (Yervoy, marketed by BMS) and approved anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Bavencio, Keytruda, Libtayo, Opdivo, Tecentriq, and Imfizi, marketed by Merck KGaA and Pfizer, Inc., Merck & Co., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., BMS, Genentech, Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC, respectively);


• | an anti-LILRB2 (also known as ILT4) program in clinical development being developed by Merck & Co., Inc.;


• | anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy antibodies in clinical development;


• | other agonist immunotherapy antibodies in clinical development; and


• | therapies targeting T regulatory cells and B cells that are in clinical development.

The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. In addition, our competitors may obtain Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete, either alone or with their strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, generally we intend to first pursue patent protection covering both compositions of matter and methods of use. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use and biomarker and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. As of March 1, 2019, with respect to vopratelimab patent rights, we own six pending U.S. provisional patent applications, two pending U.S. non-provisional application, thirty-six pending foreign patent applications, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent application within five patent families that cover compositions of matter and methods of use and ICOS-related biomarkers, and we own one issued U.S. patent that covers compositions of matter and methods of use. As of March 1, 2019, with respect to JTX-4014 patent rights, we own one pending U.S. non-provisional application, three pending foreign patent applications, and one pending PCT patent application within one patent family that covers compositions of matter and methods of use, and we do not own any issued patents. As of March 1, 2019, with respect to JTX-8064 patent rights, we own one pending U.S. non-provisional application, three pending foreign patent applications, and one pending PCT patent application within one patent family that covers compositions of matter and methods of use, and we do not own any issued patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
In addition, we exclusively in-licensed a patent portfolio from Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Memorial Hospital for Cancer, or MSK, and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson, consisting of four issued U.S. patents, one issued Australian patent, one issued Japanese patent, one issued Canadian patent, two issued Chinese patents, one issued European patent that has been validated in thirteen European jurisdictions, one pending U.S. patent application, and two pending foreign patent applications. This licensed patent portfolio covers methods related to the use of an ICOS agonist in combination with blocking agents of certain T cell inhibitory receptors. The issued patents and the pending patent applications (if issued) licensed from MSK and MD Anderson, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2030, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on unpatented know-how, inventions and other proprietary information relating to vopratelimab, JTX-4014, JTX-8064 and our other future product candidates. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our 
11

technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Exclusive License Agreement with Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases
In September 2015, we amended and restated an exclusive license agreement from December 2013 with Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, MSK and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases. Pursuant to this amended and restated license agreement, MSK and MD Anderson granted to us a worldwide exclusive license under certain patents to manufacture, develop and commercialize certain products and services, including those products for which the use in combination with another product for the treatment of any disease is covered by such patents (including, potentially, vopratelimab), and to practice certain methods covered by the patents.
Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one licensed product or licensed service as defined in the license agreement. We also are required to achieve the following developmental milestones by the end of 2019: achievement of initial efficacy of proof of concept, identification of a development candidate, and filing of an IND application with the FDA. As of September 30, 2016, we have achieved all of these milestones.
In connection with the license agreement, we issued to MSK and MD Anderson an aggregate of 60,974 shares of our common stock. We also paid an upfront license fee of $30,000 to MSK and MD Anderson. Commencing on the third anniversary of the effective date of the license agreement, we must pay an annual maintenance fee ranging in the mid-four figures to the mid-five figures. The annual maintenance fee is fully credited against the royalty payments for the same year or any subsequent year or any other amount due under the license agreement. We are obligated to pay MSK milestone payments of up to $3,475,000 for the first and second licensed products to achieve certain development and marketing approval milestones, including up to $2,725,000 for the first licensed product to achieve such developmental and marketing approval milestones. On a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product or licensed service-by-licensed service basis, we are also obligated to pay MSK a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products or licensed services, to the extent used in combination with another product for the treatment of any disease covered by the applicable patents, until the earlier of the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country or twelve years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product or licensed service in such country. If we sublicense our rights under our license agreement with MSK, we would be obligated to pay MSK a low double-digit percentage royalty of the total gross proceeds we receive in consideration of the grant of the sublicense, excluding royalties, research and development funding, payments for equity or debt securities and certain other expenses we have incurred that are reimbursed by the sublicensee.
Unless terminated earlier, the license agreement expires on the date that we no longer have any royalty payment obligations under the license agreement. We may terminate the license agreement for convenience in its entirety upon 30 days’ prior written notice to MSK and MD Anderson. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach or the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party which is not dismissed or cured within a set period of time. If we terminate the license agreement because of MSK’s and MD Anderson’s uncured breach or insolvency, we will retain a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free worldwide license to the licensed patents. Upon expiration of our obligation to pay royalties for a licensed product or service in a country, our license to the licensed patents for such licensed product or service will become exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up and royalty-free in such country.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, sales, pricing, reimbursement, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as vopratelimab, JTX-4014, JTX-8064 and other future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and regulates biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Vopratelimab, JTX-4014, JTX-8064 and other future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. We expect vopratelimab, JTX-4014, JTX-8064 and other future product candidates to be regulated by the FDA as biologics and require the submission of a BLA prior be being marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.

13

Preclinical Studies and IND
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate toxicity, assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, non-clinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at such institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on available data from the study. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, which may overlap.

• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

14

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that vopratelimab, JTX-4014, JTX-8064 and other future product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
NDA/BLA and FDA Review Process
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The FDA must approve the NDA or BLA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
15

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data for fiscal year 2019, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual product or program fees, currently $309,915 per program. These fees may be increased or decreased annually, and fee waivers, reductions or deferrals are available in certain circumstances. 
The FDA reviews each NDA and BLA for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the NDA or BLA. If the submission is found to be complete, the FDA will file the NDA or BLA, triggering a full review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The established goal of the FDA is to review applications within ten months of the filing date for a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and within six months from the filing date for a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect the manufacturing facilities for the new product and will not approve the product unless the facilities comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. Additionally, the FDA may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved, such as requiring additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. These circumstances are where another product shows clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity because it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. 
Competitors may also receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if one of our products is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
16

Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including a fast track program, priority review and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that, generally, are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs and that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. The fast track program is designed to facilitate the development and review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fulfill unmet needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
A candidate product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, the investigational product must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The assessment must also support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires the submission of a pediatric study plan prior to the assessment of data, which must contain proposed pediatric study, including study design and objectives, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data until after the approval of the drug for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extensions of deferrals are contained in FDASIA.
Post-marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals, including imposing limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, requiring that warning statements be included in the product labeling, requiring that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, imposing restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limiting the scope of any approval. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
17

FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall.
Companion Diagnostics and Complementary Diagnostics
We believe that the success of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product, identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product, or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under FDA guidance, for a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product. This is also true for a complementary diagnostic, although it is not a prerequisite for receiving the therapeutic.
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. 
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers also can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs or biologics, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law.

Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Affordable Care Act. The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Non-Patent Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of vopratelimab, JTX-4014, JTX-8064 and other future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity; a drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. 
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the Affordable Care Act. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. It is necessary to determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity and, for subsequent applications, such determinations are made a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. As of January 31, 2019, the FDA has approved 17 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. 
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods or patent protection. This six-month exclusivity may be granted 
19

based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. Furthermore, a biological product seeking licensure as biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product indicated for a rare disease or condition and granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity may not be licensed by the FDA for the protected orphan indication until after the expiration of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period or the 12-year reference product exclusivity, whichever is later.
Foreign Regulation
As in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future products and medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to the national health authority and an independent ethics committee in each country in which the company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements and ethical principles. 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. 
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If grated, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the European Union. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the European Union, then it is expected the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption.

General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. If we obtain approval in the future to market any our product candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program and may seek approval to sell the products to federal agencies. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a rebate for each product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation.
Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government. The program covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time.
Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting, and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decision. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a percentage of a manufacturer-reported average sales price. 
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. There 
21

can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, becomes effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 8.67 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.
Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
