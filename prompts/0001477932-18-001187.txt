We received the initial equity funding of $4,000 from our sole officer and director who purchased 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share. In March 2015, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to 30 independent persons pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 for total cash proceeds of $40,000. 
 
On February 2, 2016, Quest Management Inc. (the “Company”) filed Articles of Amendment with the Nevada SOS whereby it authorized a forward split at a ratio of ten-for-one share (10:1) of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Company also increased the authorized number of shares of Common Stock from 75,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 at a par value of $0.001.
 
On February 10, 2016, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with FINRA requesting the forward split at a ratio of ten-for-one share be effected in the market on February 22, 2016. 
 
During the month of January 2017, the Holders of a Promissory Note provided notices of election to convert a total of $15,000 of the Note into shares, which totaled 15,000,000 shares.
 
From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our officer and sole director, completing the write up of our business plan, purchasing our office in Latvia, which we purchased on October 31st, 2014 for $7,915, partial development of our website and the initial sales of our product. 
 
Our financial statements from inception on October 12, 2014, through October 31, 2017, report $235,133 in revenues and a net profit (loss) of $(56,034). Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. 
 
There has been no active trading market for our securities and an active trading market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is listed for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. 
 
Under U.S. federal securities legislation, our common stock will be “penny stock”. Penny stock is any equity that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a potential investor’s account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve an investor’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination. Brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

Our Current Business
 
Fitness equipment is any apparatus or device used during physical activity to enhance the strength or conditioning effects of that exercise by providing either fixed or adjustable amounts of resistance or to otherwise enhance the experience or outcome of an exercise routine.
 
A stack machine—also called a stack or rack—has a set of massive rectangular plates that are pierced by a vertical bar which has holes drilled in it to accept a pin. Each of the plates has a channel on its underside (or a hole through the middle, as visible in the picture) that aligns with one of the holes. When the pin is inserted through the channel into the hole, all of the plates above the pin rest upon it, and are lifted when the bar rises. The plates below do not rise. This allows the same machine to provide several levels of resistance over the same range of motion with an adjustment that requires very little force to accomplish in itself.
 
The means of lifting the bar varies. Some machines have a roller at the top of the bar that sits on a lever. When the lever is raised the bar can go up and the roller moves along the lever, allowing the bar to stay vertical. On some machines the bar is attached to a hinge on the lever, which causes swaying in the bar and the plates as the lever goes up and down. On other machines the bar is attached to a cable or belt, which runs through pulleys or over a wheel. The other end of the cable will either be a handle or strap that the user holds or wraps around some body part, or will be attached to a lever, adding further simple machines to the mechanical chain.
 
Usually, each plate is marked with a number. On some machines these numbers give the actual weight of the plate and those above it. On some, the number gives the force at the user’s actuation point with the machine. And on some machines the number is simply an index counting the number of plates being lifted.
 
The early Nautilus machines were a combination of lever and cable machines. They also had optional, fixed elements such as a chinning bar.
 
Plate-loaded machines (such as the Smith machine) use standard barbell plates instead of captive stacks of plates. They combine a bar-end on which to hang the plates with a number of simple machines to convey the force to the user.
 
The plate-loaded machines will often have a very high mechanical advantage, due to the need to make room for large plates over a large range of motion following a path that causes them to converge at one end or the other. Also, the motion will generally not be vertical, and the net resistance is equal to the cosine of the angle at which it is moving relative to vertical.

A cable machine is an item of equipment used in weight training or functional training. It consists of a rectangular, vertically oriented steel frame about 3 meters wide and 2 meters high, with a weight stack at each end. The cables that connect the handles to the weight stacks run through adjustable pulleys that can be fixed at any height. This allows a variety of exercises to be performed on the apparatus. One end of the cable is attached to a perforated steel bar that runs down the center of the weight stack. To select the desired amount of resistance, move the metal pin into the labeled hole in the weight stack. The other end of the cable forms a loop, which allows the user to attach the appropriate handle for the exercise. Most cable machines have a minimum of 20 pounds (~9 kilograms) of resistance in order to counterbalance the weight of the typical attachment.
 
An exercise machine is any machine used for physical exercise. These range from simple spring-like devices to computerized electromechanical rides to recirculating-stream swimming pools. Most exercise machines incorporate an Ergometer. An Ergometer is an apparatus for measuring the work a person exerts while exercising as used in training or cardiac stress tests or other medical tests.
 
Elliptical machines
 
Ellipticals are a combination of stair-climbing and a treadmill. Generally it contains two tracks upon which the user stands; when he or she moves his or her legs, they describe an elliptical motion (hence the machine name). Some ellipticals have magnetic resistance controls that add difficulty to doing the motion.
 
Glider machines
 
This machine allows the user to stand on two separate foot pedals and use their own muscles to create the movement. The stabilized movement can be likened to that of a “swing set” for each leg.
 
Climbing machines
 
Also named stair-climbing machines, they work the user’s legs as he/she pumps pedals up and down, much like climbing stairs. Some climbing machines have handles to push and pull to exercise the whole body.
 
Rowing machines
 
Rowing machines, also named rowers, simulate the body movements of using a rowing boat.
 
INITIAL FOCUS OF OUR BUSINESS
 
Our company’s focus is on the development of operating a business of wholesale distribution of fitness equipment, including but not limited to the following: Fitness Equipment, Sports Equipment, Gym Equipment, Exercise Equipment and Bodybuilding Equipment.
 
Prospective buyers (most likely distributors or wholesale distribution) are able to browse our web site for fitness equipment products, register and communicate with our company and further enquire about the products. Initially our officer and director will be responsible for the sale of our products along with an independent salesperson who will work solely for commission on any products they sell. Any interested wholesaler will be asked to place their order with our company.

Industry Analysis & Industry Trends
 
The Gym and Exercise Equipment Manufacturing industry is benefiting from US trends regarding general health consciousness and a younger, more active generation becoming involved in sports. This move has contributed to a rise in demand for industry equipment, which has led to revenue growth over the five-year period. However, labor-intensive tasks such as equipment manufacturing are increasingly being outsourced to areas with low labor costs, hurting domestic manufacturers. World expects the industry to continue growing slowly over the five years to 2019, with revenue projected to increase. As consumers become increasingly health conscious and the government ramps up its anti-obesity campaigns, demand for gym and exercise equipment will increase, leading to a steady rise in revenue.
Industry Report 
 
Some of the major factors that affect the number of manufacturers in a certain region are weather, size of the population and proximity to ports. Weather is a major factor that influences the sports participation rate, which can, to an extent, explain the concentration of industry establishments across certain states. The higher the sports participation rate is, the more likely it is that consumers will use gym and exercise equipment. For example, on a per state basis, California has the single highest concentration of gym and exercise equipment manufacturers, accounting for 17.2% of total industry establishments. One of the reasons behind this trend is that people are more inclined to exercise in warmer weather.

Worldwide sales of fitness equipment are expected to reach nearly $15 billion by 2018, according to Global Industry Analysts. Markets such as the Asia/Pacific region, Latin America, and the Middle East drive growth.
 
The US fitness equipment manufacturing industry is a subset of the sporting goods manufacturing industry.
 
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
 
Demand is driven by consumer income and demographic trends. The profitability of individual companies depends on unique product designs and effective marketing. Large companies have some advantages in brand recognition, but small companies can compete effectively by offering unique products.
PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS & TECHNOLOGY
 
Major products are motorized treadmills, stationary bikes, stair climbers, rowing machines, and elliptical “cross-trainers,” collectively called aerobic exercisers; and weightlifting machines (“strength training”), and traditional weightlifting equipment (“free weights” and benches). In addition, there are a large number of ancillary products. This equipment allows individuals to exercise by themselves in a limited space. The two major market segments for fitness equipment are the home and the institutional.

Alibaba.com Hong Kong Limited (http://www.alibaba.com/): Alibaba.com is perhaps the best known business-to-business web site and aims at connecting Chinese exporters to importers in the rest of the word. While it lists fitness equipment products, these are incidental and constitute a minute part of their product listing. As well, this web site primarily target Chinese manufacturers and exporters.
 
None of the businesses listed above focus on fitness equipment and simply allow companies to list their products without apparent review to the claims that the products meet the different classification of fitness equipment.
 
MARKETING
 
We target three audience segments: the producers in China, wholesale buyers in the U.S. and fitness organizations. We contact them via phone, email and visits at trade shows. When looking for information, most people start with one of the major search engines such as google.com, yahoo.com or bing.com. It is therefore imperative that when people search for information about fitness equipment products that our web site is one of the highest ranked sites. We will retain the services of a specialist in search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is intended to improve the ranking of our web site when people search for a specific term. Continuous updates to our web site and product offerings will encourage web visitors to return over and over again.
 
We will also investigate advertising in industry magazines and web sites that are frequented by people in our target market.
 
SALES
 
Revenue will be derived from sales our products to wholesalers and distributors. We derive revenue from companies (wholesalers and distributors) that wish to buy our products. We target the first wholesalers and distributors via phone, email and visits at trade shows. We may also target the wholesalers and distributors via social marketing (such as twitter, facebook, myspace and youtube), word of mouth, referrals, etc. 
Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees.
 
We are a development stage company and currently have no employees. Dmitrij Ozolins, our President and a Director handles the Company’s day-to-day operations. We intend to hire employees as revenue supports the expense. Our initial sales are being made by our President and commissioned independent salespeople.
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
