 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 The Company provides a wide range of products for the packaging needs of our customers and is one of the worlds largest producers of high quality pressure sensitive, in-mold and heat transfer labels and a major manufacturer of cut and stack, roll fed, aluminum and shrink sleeve labels. The Company also provides a full complement of print methods including rotogravure, lithographic, flexographic, digital and a combination of flexographic and screen printing, plus in-house pre-press services. 
 Pressure Sensitive Labels: 
 Pressure sensitive labels adhere to a surface with pressure. The label typically consists of four elements  a substrate, which may include paper, foil or plastic; an adhesive, which may be permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces. The release coating and protective backing are removed prior to application to the container, exposing the adhesive, and the label is pressed or rolled into place. Innovative features of this product include promotional neckbands, peel-away coupons, resealable labels, see-through window graphics, and holographic foil enhancements to cold and hot foil stamping. 
 Pressure sensitive labels are the largest category of the overall label market and provide an extremely versatile, low-cost application that is able to produce sharp, bright colors in a wide variety of applications. We are one of the worlds largest producers of high quality pressure sensitive labels and this market represents a significant growth opportunity for us. 
 In-Mold Labels (IML): 
 The in-mold label process applies a label to a plastic container as the container is being formed in the mold cavity. The finished IML product is a finely detailed label that performs consistently well for plastic container manufacturers and adds marketing value and product security for consumer product companies. 
 Each component of the IML production process requires a special expertise for success. The components include the substrate (the base material for the label), inks, overcoats, varnishes and adhesives. We believe we are unique in the industry in that we manufacture IMLs on rotogravure, flexographic and lithographic printing presses. There are several critical characteristics of a successful IML: the material needs a proper coefficient of friction so that the finished label is easily and consistently picked up and applied to the injection or blow-molded container, the substrate must be able to hold the labels inks, including metallics and fluorescents, overlay varnishes and adhesives and the material must be able to lay smoothly, without wrinkle or bulge, when applied to a very hot, just molded plastic container that will

 quickly shrink, along with the label, as its temperature falls. We continually search for alternate substrates to be used in the IML process in order to improve label performance and capabilities, as well as to reduce substrate costs. Technical innovations in this area include the use of peel-away IML coupons and scented and holographic labels. 
 Heat Transfer Labels (HTL): 
 HTL are reverse printed and transferred from a special release liner onto the container using heat and pressure. The labels are a composition of inks and lacquers tailored to the customers specific needs. These labels are printed and then shipped to blow molders and/or contract decorators who transfer the labels to the containers. Once applied, the labels are permanently adhered to the container. The graphics capabilities include fine vignettes, metallic and thermochromatic inks, as well as the patented frost, giving an acid-etch appearance. 
 Therimage is our pioneer heat transfer label technology developed primarily for applications involving plastic containers serving the home & personal care and food & beverage consumer markets. Our Clear ADvantage brand enables us to provide premium graphics on both glass and plastic containers facilitating the highly sought after no label look for the health and beauty aid, beverage, personal care, household chemical and promotional markets. Our ink only and flameless HTL technology have increased our capabilities in this area. Flameless technology enables us to provide a solution to customers who want to remove open flames from their operations, which are normally required to pre-treat and post-treat containers for Therimage and Clear ADvantage products. Flameless technology has applications in all the aforementioned markets. 
 Cut and Stack: 
 Cut and stack labels are adhered to containers using an adhesive applied during the labeling process. These labels are an attractive and cost-effective choice for high volume applications. These labels can be produced on a wide variety of substrates and accommodate a comprehensive range of embellishments including foil stamping, embossing, metallics and unique varnish finishes. 
 Our innovations within cut and stack labels include peel-away promotional labels, thermochromics, holographics and metalized films. We also offer promotional products such as scratch-off coupons and static-clings. 
 Roll Fed: 
 Roll fed labels can be applied to any type of container and offer customers optimum space for brand presentation at a competitive price. Our roll fed labels are highly resistant to tearing and moisture and can be printed in brilliant colors with a wide range of special effects using thermochromic inks and interactive technologies. 
Shrink Sleeve Labels: 
 Shrink sleeve labels are produced in colorful, cutting edge styles and materials. The labels are manufactured as sleeves, slid over glass or plastic bottles and then heated to conform precisely to the contours of the container. This label type is increasingly popular with consumer goods companies such as beverage manufacturers as it allows for product differentiation as well as having a 360-degree label and tamper resistant features. Demand in other end-markets (including the food and personal care markets) continues to grow, broadening the market opportunities for shrink sleeve labels as a whole. 
 Aluminum Labels: 
 Fully printable and equipped for embossing, our aluminum labels let our customers products shine with premium shelf impact while providing tamper evidence protection. The aluminum product range includes elegant neck labels that effortlessly adapt to the bottleneck shape and can be customized with embossing and de-embossing and a variety of ink effects. Also available in aluminum are Smart Top can lid labels. Smart Top labels are designed to maximize branding and messaging. They also provide the added benefit of protection against dust and germs and are fully recyclable. 
Graphic Services: 
 We provide graphics and pre-press services for our customers at all of our manufacturing locations. These services include the conversion of customer digital files and artwork into proofs, production of print layouts and printing plates, and product mock ups and samples for market research. 
 As a result of these capabilities, we are able to go from concept to printed label, thus increasing our customers speed to market and further enhancing our value proposition. 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 We provide a complete line of label solutions and a variety of pre-press activities. Our vision is to be the premier global resource for decorating solutions. We sell to a broad range of home & personal care, wine & spirits, food & beverage, healthcare and specialty consumer product companies located in the North American, Latin American, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific regions. Our sales strategy is a consultative selling approach. Our sales organization reviews the requirements of the container and offers

  a number of alternative decorating methods. Our customers view us as an expert source of materials, methods and technologies with the ability to offer the most cost-effective solution. 
 We have continued to make progress in expanding our customer base and portfolio of products, pre-press activities and manufacturing locations throughout the world. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales to major customers (those exceeding 10% of the Companys net revenues in one or more of the periods presented) approximated 10%, 14% and 17%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated net revenues. All of these sales were made to The Procter & Gamble Company. In fiscal 2018, we entered the German label market with the acquisition of GEWA Etiketten GmbH located in Bingen am Rhein, Germany, which specializes in producing pressure sensitive labels for the wine & spirits market. Our fiscal 2018 acquisition of Constantia Labels expanded our presence in Germany and gave us entrance into the Belgian, Romanian and Vietnamese label markets. We also entered the Tanzanian label market in fiscal 2018 with the acquisition of TP Label Limited, the labels business of Tanzania Printers Limited (Tanzania Printers), and TP Kenya Limited (collectively, TP Label), which is located in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania with a sales and distribution center located in Nairobi, Kenya. TP Label is primarily a pressure sensitive and cut and stack business, serving customers in the food & beverage market. We also entered the New Zealand wine & spirits market in fiscal 2018 with a start-up operating in Auckland, New Zealand. 
 PRODUCTION AND QUALITY 
 To guarantee consistent quality results, all of our label decorating services are backed by aggressively implemented and administered quality programs and qualified technical support staff. Our quality assurance program ensures excellence in every label.

 EMPLOYEES 
 As of March 31, 2019, we employ over 8,300 associates across more than 70 operations globally. 
 RAW MATERIALS 
 Common to the printing industry, we purchase proprietary products from a number of raw material suppliers. To prevent potential disruptions to our manufacturing facilities, we have developed relationships with more than one supply source for each of our critical raw materials. Our raw material suppliers are major corporations with successful historical performance. Although we intend to prevent any long-term business interruption due to our inability to obtain raw materials, there could be short-term manufacturing disruptions during the vendor qualification period for any new raw material source. 
ACQUISITIONS 
 We are continually in pursuit of selective acquisitions that will contribute to our growth. We believe that acquisitions are a method of increasing our presence in existing markets, expanding into new markets, gaining new customers and product offerings and improving operating efficiencies through economies of scale. Through acquisitions, we intend to broaden our revenue stream by expanding our lines of innovative label solutions, offering a variety of technical and graphic services and fulfilling the specific needs and requirements of our customers. The printing and packaging industry is highly fragmented and offers many opportunities for acquisitions. 
 On October 31, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement (as amended) with Constantia Flexibles Germany GmbH, Constantia Flexibles International GmbH, Constantia Flexibles Group GmbH and GPC Holdings B.V. (collectively, Constantia Flexibles), acquiring 100% of the Labels Division of Constantia Flexibles (Constantia Labels). Constantia Labels, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, is a leader in label solutions serving the food, beverage and consumer packaging goods industries. 
 On October 11, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of TP Label Limited, the labels business of Tanzania Printers Limited (Tanzania Printers), and TP Kenya Limited (collectively, TP Label), which is located in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania with a sales and distribution center located in Nairobi, Kenya. TP Label is primarily a pressure sensitive and cut and stack label business, serving customers in the food & beverage market. 
 On August 3, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of GEWA Etiketten GmbH (GEWA). GEWA is located in Bingen am Rhein, Germany and specializes in producing pressure sensitive labels for the wine & spirits market.

 COMPETITION 
 We have a large number of competitors in the pressure sensitive, cut and stack and roll fed label markets and several competitors in each of the IML, shrink sleeve, HTL and aluminum label markets. Some of these competitors in the pressure sensitive and cut and stack label markets have greater financial and other resources than us. The competitors in IML, shrink sleeve and HTL markets are either private companies or subsidiaries of public companies and we cannot assess the financial resources of these organizations. We could be adversely affected should a competitor develop labels similar or technologically superior to our labels. We believe competition is principally dependent upon product performance, service, pricing, technical support and innovation. 
PATENTS AND LICENSES 
 We own a number of patents and patent applications that relate to the products and services we offer to our customers. Although these patents are important to us, we are not dependent upon any one patent. We believe that these patents, collectively, along with our ability to be a single source provider of many packaging needs, provide us with a competitive advantage over our competition. The expiration or unenforceability of any one of our patents would not have a material adverse effect on us. 
REGULATION 
 Our operations are subject to regulation by federal, state and foreign environmental protection agencies. To ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements, we have implemented an internal compliance program. Additionally, we continue to make capital investments to maintain compliance with these environmental regulations and to improve our existing equipment. However, there can be no assurances that these regulations will not require expenditures beyond those that are currently anticipated. 
 In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration regulates the raw materials used in labels for various products. These regulations apply to the consumer product companies for which we produce labels. We use materials specified by the consumer product companies in producing labels.
