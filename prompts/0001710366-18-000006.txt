ITEM 1. | Business

General
All dollar amounts discussed in this section are in millions of U.S. dollars, except for per unit amounts, and unless otherwise indicated.
Our business originated as part of the operations of our former parent company, CNX, formerly known as CONSOL Energy Inc., which was an integrated energy company operating two primary divisions - a Pennsylvania mining division and an oil and natural gas exploration and production division. CNX and its predecessors had been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864. CNX entered the natural gas business in the 1980s and since that time continued to expand its oil and natural gas exploration and production operations as well as continuing to operate its coal mining assets. On November 28, 2017, CNX split into two, independently traded public companies, a natural gas company, now known as CNX Resources Corporation, and CONSOL Energy Inc. As part of the separation, CNX transferred to the Company substantially all of its coal-related assets, including its Pennsylvania Mining Complex (including all of its interest in CONSOL Coal Resources LP ), the CONSOL Marine Terminal and approximately 1.6 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves located in the Northern Appalachian (“NAPP”), the Central Appalachian (“CAPP”) and the Illinois Basins (“ILB”).
The Company was incorporated in Delaware on June 21, 2017. The address of our principal executive offices is 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317. We maintain a website at http://www.consolenergy.com/ and the information contained in or connected to the website will not be deemed to be incorporated in this document, and you should not rely on any such information in making an investment decision.
Our Company
We are a leading, low-cost producer of high-quality bituminous coal, focused on the extraction and preparation of coal in the Appalachian Basin due to our ability to efficiently produce and deliver large volumes of high-quality coal at competitive prices, the strategic location of our mines, and the industry experience of our management team. Our predecessors have been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864.
Coal from the PAMC is valued because of its high energy content (as measured in Btu per pound), relatively low levels of sulfur and other impurities, and strong thermoplastic properties that enable it to be used in metallurgical as well as thermal applications. We take advantage of these desirable quality characteristics and our extensive logistical network, which is directly served by both the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads, to aggressively market our product to a broad base of strategically selected, top-performing power plant customers in the eastern United States. We also capitalize on the operational synergies afforded by the CONSOL Marine Terminal to export our coal to thermal and metallurgical end users in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. 
Our operations, including the PAMC and the CONSOL Marine Terminal, have consistently generated strong cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, the PAMC controls 735.5 million tons of high-quality Pittsburgh seam reserves, enough to allow for approximately 26 years of full-capacity production. In addition, we own or control approximately 1.6 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves located in the NAPP, the CAPP and the ILB, which we believe could provide a solid growth platform in the future. Our vision is to maximize cash flow generation through the safe, compliant and efficient operation of this core asset base, while strategically reducing debt, returning capital through share buybacks or dividends, and, when prudent, allocating capital toward compelling growth opportunities.
Our core businesses consist of our: 

• | Pennsylvania Mining Complex: The PAMC, which includes the Bailey Mine, the Enlow Fork Mine and the Harvey Mine, has extensive high-quality coal reserves. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of uniform, high-Btu thermal coal that is ideal for high productivity, low-cost longwall operations. The design of the PAMC is optimized to produce large quantities of coal on a cost-efficient basis. We are able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, the technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of our mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of coal at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods. We own a 75% undivided interest in PAMC, with the remaining 25% being owned by CCR, as discussed below.

• | CCR Ownership: Approximately 60% limited partnership ownership and 100% general partnership ownership interest in the Partnership, a master limited partnership originally formed by CNX to manage and further develop its active coal operations in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2017, CCR’s assets included a 25% undivided interest in, and full operational control over, the PAMC.


• | CONSOL Marine Terminal: Through our subsidiary CONSOL Marine Terminals LLC we provide coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. The terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars. It is also one of the few terminals in the United States served by two railroads, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation Inc.


• | Greenfield Reserves: Ownership of approximately 1.6 billion tons of high-quality, undeveloped coal reserves located in NAPP, CAPP and the ILB.

A map showing the location of our significant properties is below: 
Our core values of safety, compliance, and continuous improvement are the foundation of the Company’s identity and are the basis for how management defines continued success. We believe the Company’s rich resource base, coupled with these core values, allows management to create value for the long-term. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) projects in its 2017 annual energy outlook that coal’s share of the U.S. electric power generation mix will rebound from 30% in 2016 to 32% in 2021, driven largely by rising gas prices and the prospects of a more favorable policy stance under the current U.S. presidential administration. We believe that the use of coal as a principal fuel source for electricity in the United States will continue for many years. Additionally, we believe that as worldwide economies grow, the demand for electricity from fossil fuels will grow as well, resulting in expansion of worldwide demand for our coal.

Our Relationship with CONSOL Coal Resources LP
In July 2015, CONSOL Coal Resources LP, formerly known as CNX Coal Resources LP, closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interests at a price to the public of $15.00 per unit. The underwriters in the CCR initial public offering exercised an over-allotment option to purchase and resell an additional 561,067 common units to the public at $15.00 per unit. In conjunction with the IPO, CCR sold an additional 5,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interests in a private placement. CCR’s general partner is CONSOL Coal Resources GP LLC, formerly known as CNX Coal Resources GP LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The initial assets of CCR were comprised of a 20% undivided interest in PAMC. 
CCR is managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of its general partner, CONSOL Coal Resources GP LLC, many of whom are also executive officers of the Company. The General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company has the right to appoint the entire board of directors of the General Partner, including its independent directors. CCR’s unitholders are not entitled to elect the directors of the General Partner nor can they directly or indirectly participate in the management of CCR. The executive officers of the General Partner are compensated by us or certain of our affiliates. Under our omnibus agreement with CCR, CCR reimburses us for compensation-related expenses (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts) attributable to the portion of an executive’s compensation that is allocable to that executive’s service for the General Partner. 
In September 2016, CCR and its wholly owned subsidiary, CONSOL Thermal Holdings LLC (“CONSOL Thermal”), formerly known as CNX Thermal Holdings LLC, entered into a Contribution Agreement with CNX (at the time known as CONSOL Energy Inc.), Consol Pennsylvania Coal Company LLC and Conrhein Coal Company under which CONSOL Thermal acquired an additional 5% undivided interest in and to the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, in exchange for (i) cash consideration in the amount of $21.5 million and (ii) CCR’s issuance of 3,956,496 Class A Preferred Units representing limited partnership interests in CCR at an issue price of $17.01 per Class A Preferred Unit, or an aggregate $67.3 million in equity consideration. 
On October 2, 2017, CNX provided a conversion notice to CCR with respect to all Class A Preferred Units owned by it, and thereafter caused all such Class A Preferred Units to convert, on a 1-to-1 ratio, into common units representing limited partnership interests in CCR. 
In connection with the separation, CNX transferred all of its ownership interest in CCR to the Company, which consisted of (i) 5,006,496 common units and 11,611,067 subordinated units (representing a ~60% limited partnership interest), and (ii) 1.7% general partner interest and all incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”). Subordinated units are not entitled to any distribution from CCR unless CCR makes a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.5125 per common unit. CCR made minimum distributions per subordinated unit equal to the distribution per common unit for nine of the ten quarters since CCR’s IPO. CCR did not meet the requirement for a subordinated unit distribution with respect to fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016. IDRs entitle the holder to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 48%, of the available cash CCR distributes from operating surplus in excess of $0.5894 per unit per quarter. The maximum distribution of 48% does not include any distributions that the General Partner or its affiliates may receive on common units, subordinated units, or the General Partner interest that they own.
Our Strategy 
Our strategy is to increase stockholder value by safely and compliantly operating our business, developing and growing our existing coal assets and participating in global coal markets. The Company’s coal assets align with our long-term strategic objectives. Our current production, which includes production from the Bailey, Enlow Fork and Harvey mines, can be sold domestically or abroad, as either thermal coal or high volatile metallurgical coal. These low-cost mines, with five longwalls, produce a high-Btu Pittsburgh-seam coal that is lower in sulfur than many Northern Appalachian coals. Our onsite logistics infrastructure at the Bailey Central Preparation Plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ transportation needs. Our ability to accommodate multiple unit trains allows for the seamless transition from empty inbound trains to fully loaded outbound trains at our facility. These mines and their logistics infrastructure, along with our 100%-owned CONSOL Marine Terminal, which is served by both Norfolk Southern and CSX, will allow us to continue to participate in the world’s thermal and metallurgical coal markets. The ability to serve both domestic and international markets with premium thermal and crossover metallurgical coal provides tremendous optionality. 
9

In order to continue to carry out our strategy, we will continue to adhere to and pursue the following strategic objectives: 
Selectively grow our business to maximize shareholder value by capitalizing on synergies with our assets and expertise 
We plan to judiciously direct the cash generated by our operations toward those opportunities that present the greatest potential for value creation to our shareholders, particularly those that take advantage of synergies with our asset base and/or with the expertise of our management team. To that end, we plan to regularly and rigorously evaluate opportunities both for organic growth and for acquisitions, joint ventures and other business arrangements in the coal industry and related industries that complement our core operations. In addition, our ownership interest in CCR provides us with a unique vehicle for generating cash and raising capital, through the potential future drop down of assets into CCR which, if utilized, will allow us to generate cash to assist in the execution of our growth strategy. Both the PAMC and our Greenfield Reserves present the potential for organic growth projects if long-term market conditions are favorable. For example, we are currently evaluating a project to improve the recovery and processing of fine coal from the Bailey Central Preparation Plant, which has the potential to add up to 1.5 million tons per year of additional clean coal production without additional mining of raw tons. Moreover, the Harvey Mine’s existing infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt and material handling system, is able to support an additional permanent longwall mining system with moderate additional capital investment in mining equipment. Such an investment would further increase the annual production capacity of the PAMC by 5 million tons. Our Greenfield Reserves associated with the potential Mason Dixon and River Mine projects present additional organic growth opportunities in NAPP, and our Greenfield Reserves associated with the Itmann Mine, Martinka Mine and Birch Mine provide actionable organic growth opportunities in the metallurgical coal space, should market conditions warrant. Our management team has extensive experience in developing, operating and marketing a wide variety of coal assets previously owned by CNX, and is well qualified to evaluate organic and external growth opportunities. We intend to prudently use our interest in CCR to benefit our growth strategy, and plan to carefully weigh any capital investment decisions against alternate uses of the cash to help ensure we are delivering the most value to our shareholders. 
Continue to grow our share at top-performing rail-served power plants in our core market areas, while opportunistically pursuing export and crossover metallurgical opportunities 
We plan to seek to minimize our market risk and maximize realizations by continuing to focus on selling coal to strategically-selected, top-performing, rail-served power plants located in our core market areas in the eastern United States. In 2017, our top domestic power plant customers included thirteen plants that each took delivery of more than 500,000 tons of PAMC coal. These top power plant customers, which collectively accounted for 83% of our domestic coal shipments in 2017, operated at a 13% greater weighted average capacity factor than other NAPP rail-served plants during January through November (the most recent month for which data are available), and none have announced plans to retire. We have grown our share at these plants from 10% in 2012 to 35% in the first eleven months of 2017, and we believe we can continue to grow this share by displacing less competitive supply from NAPP, CAPP and other basins. We also plan to continue to work on optimizing our portfolio of top customer plants and identifying and penetrating new plants that we believe are aligned with our strategic objectives and would be a good fit for our coal. For example, one of our top customer plants in 2017 was not in our 2016 portfolio, and another grew its volume from just over 100,000 tons of PAMC coal in 2016 to more than 900,000 tons of PAMC coal in 2017. While the majority of our production is directed toward our established base of domestic power plant customers, many of which are secured through annual or multi-year contracts, we also have continued to diversify our portfolio by placing a growing portion of our production in the export and crossover metallurgical markets. These markets provide us with pricing upside when markets are strong and with volume stability when markets are weak. For 2018 and 2019, our contracted position, as of February 6, 2018, is at >95% and 70%, respectively, assuming a 27 million ton annual coal sales volume. We believe our committed and contracted position is well-balanced in hedging against market downside risk while allowing us to continue to build out our portfolio strategically and opportunistically as the market evolves. 
Drive operational excellence through safety, compliance, and continuous improvement 
We intend to continue focusing on our core values of safety, compliance and continuous improvement. We operate some of the most productive, lowest-cost underground mines in the coal industry, while simultaneously setting some of the industry’s highest standards for safety and compliance. For 2013 through 2017, our Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) reportable incident rate was approximately 39% lower than the national average underground bituminous coal mine incident rate. Furthermore, our MSHA significant and substantial (“S&S”) citation rate per 100 inspection hours was approximately 33% lower than the industry’s average MSHA S&S citation rate over the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017. We believe that our focus on safety and compliance promotes greater reliability in our operations, which fosters long-term customer relationships and lower operating costs that support higher margins. Consistent with our core value of continuous improvement, we have improved our productivity from 5.69 tons per employee hour in 2014 to 7.31 tons per employee hour in 2017, and have reduced our cash costs of coal sold per ton by 22% over this same period. We intend to continue to grow the economic competiveness of 
10

our operations by proactively identifying, pursuing and implementing efficiency improvements and new technologies that can drive down unit costs without compromising safety or compliance. 
Ability to Grow Cash Flow through Drop-Downs into CCR 
Our controlling ownership interest in the Partnership provides us with a unique vehicle for generating cash and raising capital to pursue our growth strategy. Over time we may drop down assets into CCR. We believe that such drop-downs, if utilized, would allow us to grow CCR’s distributions and potentially increase the value of the units and incentive distribution rights of CCR that we hold. Furthermore, the cash generated from these drop-downs could help us to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy. Finally, we believe that our different classes of securities (C-Corp and MLP) provide us with multiple options for accessing capital markets and taking advantage of the best available cost of capital at any given point in time. We believe this is a unique advantage for us compared to other companies in the coal industry. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well-positioned to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths: 
Focus on free cash flow generation supported by industry-leading margins and optimized production levels 
We intend to continue our focus on maintaining high margins by optimizing production from our high-quality reserves and leveraging our extensive logistics infrastructure and broad market reach. The PAMC’s low-cost structure, high-quality product, favorable access to rail and port infrastructure and diverse base of end-use customers allow it to move large volumes of coal at positive cash margins throughout a variety of market conditions. For example, despite recent challenging domestic market conditions driven largely by relatively mild weather, low natural gas prices, and stagnant electricity demand, which caused total U.S. coal production to fall by approximately 14% from 2015 to 2017, PAMC managed to grow production by approximately 15% during this same period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the PAMC generated an average cash margin per ton of $16.50. Through our recent capital investment program, we have optimized our mining operations and logistics infrastructure to sustainably drive down our cash operating costs. Furthermore, our significant portfolio of multi-year, committed and priced contracts with our longstanding customer base will enhance our ability to sustain high margins in varied commodity price environments. We believe that these factors will help enable us to maintain higher margins per ton on average than our competitors and better position us to maintain profitability throughout commodity price cycles. 
Extensive, High-Quality Reserve Base 
The PAMC has extensive high-quality reserves of bituminous coal. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of uniform, high-Btu coal that is ideal for high productivity, low-cost longwall operations. As of December 31, 2017, the PAMC included 735.5 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves that are sufficient to support approximately 26 years of full-capacity production. The advantageous qualities of our coal enable us to compete for demand from a broader range of coal-fired power plants compared to mining operations in basins that typically produce coal with a comparatively lower heat content (ILB and the Powder River Basin (“PRB”)), higher sulfur content (ILB and most areas in NAPP) and higher chlorine content (certain areas of ILB). Our remaining reserves have an average as-received gross heat content of 12,915 Btu/lb (on an as-received basis), while production from the PRB, ILB, CAPP and the rest of NAPP averages approximately 8,700 Btu/lb, 11,400 Btu/lb, 12,300 Btu/lb and 12,400 Btu/lb, respectively (based on the average quality reported by EIA for U.S. power plant deliveries for the three years ended June 30, 2017. Moreover, our remaining reserves have an average sulfur content of 2.30% (on an as-received basis), while production from the ILB averages ~2.9% sulfur and production from the rest of NAPP averages ~3.3% sulfur (again based on EIA power plant delivery data for the three years ended June 30, 2017). With our high Btu content and low-cost structure, our 2017 total costs averaged $1.35 per mmBtu, which is lower than any monthly average Louisiana Henry Hub natural gas spot price during the past 20+ years, and provides a strong foundation for competing against natural gas even after accounting for differences in delivered costs and power plant efficiencies. In addition to the substantial reserve base associated with the PAMC, our 1.6 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves in NAPP, CAPP and ILB feature both thermal and metallurgical reserves and provide additional optionality for organic growth or monetization as market conditions allow. 
World-Class, Well-Capitalized, Low-Cost Longwall Mining Complex 
Since 2006, we have invested over $2.0 billion at the PAMC ($1.4 billion of which has been invested in the past five years) to develop technologically advanced, large-scale longwall mining operations and related production and logistics infrastructure. As a result, the PAMC is the most productive and efficient coal mining complex in NAPP, averaging 6.77 tons of coal production per employee hour in 2015-2016, compared to 4.94 tons of coal production per employee hour for other currently-
11

operating NAPP longwall mines. For the year ending December 31, 2017, productivity further increased to 7.31 tons of coal per employee hour, compared with an average of 5.23 tons per employee hour for all other currently-operating NAPP longwalls. We believe our substantial capital investment in the PAMC will enable us to maintain high production volumes, low operating costs and a strong safety and environmental compliance record, which we believe are key to supporting stable financial performance and cash flows throughout business and commodity price cycles. As a result, we expect to be able to mine the remaining 26+ years of reserves at the PAMC with only maintenance-of-production levels of capital expenditure. 
Strategically Located Mining Operations with Advanced Distribution Capabilities and Excellent Access to Key Logistics Infrastructure 
Our logistics infrastructure and proximity to coal-fired power plants in the eastern United States provide us with operational and marketing flexibility, reduce the cost to deliver coal to our core markets and allow us to realize higher netback prices. We believe that we have a significant transportation cost advantage compared to many of our competitors, particularly producers in the ILB and PRB, for deliveries to customers in our core markets and to East Coast ports for international shipping. For example, based on publicly available data and internal estimates, we believe that the transportation cost advantage from our mines compared to ILB mines (not accounting for Btu differences) is approximately $3 to $8 per ton for coal delivered to foreign consumers in Europe and India, $4 to $8 per ton for coal delivered to domestic customers in the Carolinas, and an even more pronounced cost advantage for coal delivered to domestic customers in the mid-Atlantic states. Our ability to accommodate multiple unit trains at the Bailey Central Preparation Plant, which includes a dual-batch loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of clean coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track with three sidings, allows for the seamless transition of locomotives from empty inbound trains to fully loaded outbound trains at our facility. Furthermore, the PAMC has exceptional access to export infrastructure in the United States. Through our 100%-owned CONSOL Marine Terminal, served by both the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads, we are able to participate in the world’s seaborne coal markets with premium thermal and crossover metallurgical coal. 
Strong, Well-Established Customer Base Supporting Contractual Volumes 
We have a well-established and diverse blue chip customer base, comprised primarily of domestic electric-power-producing companies located in the eastern United States. We have had success entering into multi-year coal sales agreements with our customers due to our longstanding relationships, reliability of production and delivery, competitive pricing and high coal quality. More than 90% of our sales in 2017 were to customer companies that were in our 2016 portfolio, and all but one of our top domestic power plant customers in 2017 (which represent the thirteen plants to which we shipped at least 500,000 tons of PAMC coal in 2017), have been in our portfolio for at least four consecutive years. In addition, to mitigate our exposure with respect to coal-fired power plant retirements, we have strategically developed our customer base to include power plants that are economically positioned to continue operating for the foreseeable future and that are equipped with state-of-the-art environmental controls. In 2017, only approximately 2% of our total sales were to domestic power plant customers that have announced plans to retire through 2023. Moreover, none of our top thirteen customer plants, which accounted for 83% of our shipments in 2017, have announced plans to retire. These top plants operated at a 13% higher weighted average capacity factor than other NAPP rail-served plants in January-November 2017 (the most recent month for which data are available), highlighting their economic competitiveness in the challenging power markets. Since 2012, the Company has increased its market share at these thirteen plants from 10% to 35%. In addition to our robust domestic customer base, we also have favorable access to seaborne coal markets through our long-standing commercial relationship with a leading coal trading and brokering customer that maintains a broad market presence with foreign coal consumers. We have grown our exports of PAMC coal to the seaborne thermal and crossover metallurgical markets from an average of 5.5 million tons per year (or approximately 23% of our annual sales volume) in 2015-2016 to 8.3 million tons (or approximately 32% of our annual sales volume) in 2017. 
Highly Experienced Management Team and Operating Team 
Our management and operating teams have (i) significant expertise owning, developing and managing complex thermal and metallurgical coal mining operations, (ii) valuable relationships with customers, railroads and other participants across the coal industry, (iii) technical wherewithal and demonstrated success in developing new applications and customers for our coal products, in both the thermal and metallurgical markets, and (iv) a proven track record of successfully building, enhancing and managing coal assets in a reliable and cost-effective manner throughout all parts of the commodity cycle. We intend to leverage these qualities to continue to successfully develop our coal mining assets while efficiently and flexibly managing our operations to maximize operating cash flow.
CONSOL Energy’s Capital Expenditure Budget
In 2018, CONSOL Energy expects to invest $125 - $145 million in maintenance capital expenditures. The Company is not expecting to invest in expansion projects in 2018. However, the Company continually evaluates potential acquisitions.

Detail Coal Operations
Coal Reserves 
At December 31, 2017, the Company had an estimated 2.3 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. As of December 31, 2017, the PAMC included 735.5 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves that are sufficient to support approximately 26 years of full-capacity production. Reserves are the portion of the proven and probable tonnage that meet the Company’s economic criteria regarding mining height, preparation plant recovery, depth of overburden and stripping ratio. Generally, these reserves would be commercially mineable at year-end price and cost levels. Spacing of points of observation for confidence levels in reserve calculations is based on guidelines in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 891 (Coal Resource Classification System of the U.S. Geological Survey). Our estimates for proved reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance. Estimates for proved reserves are based on points of observation that are equal to or less than 0.5 miles apart. Estimates for probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are computed from points of observation that are between 0.5 to 1.5 miles apart. An exception is made concerning spacing of observation points with respect to our Pittsburgh No. 8 coal seam reserves. Because of the well-known continuity of this seam, spacing requirements are 3,000 feet or less for proved reserves and between 3,000 and 7,920 feet for probable reserves. 
The Company’s estimates of proven and probable coal reserves do not rely on isolated points of observation. Small pools of reserves based on a single observation point are not considered; continuity between observation points over a large area is necessary for proved or probable reserves. Estimates of the Company’s coal reserves have historically been calculated both by internal geologists and engineers employed by CNX, and independent third parties. Reserve estimates and evaluation processes are periodically audited by independent third parties to ensure accuracy. The Company’s proven and probable coal reserves fall within the range of commercially marketed coals in the United States. The marketability of coal depends on its value-in-use for a particular application, and this is affected by coal quality, such as sulfur content, ash and heating value. Modern power plant boiler design aspects can compensate for coal quality differences that occur. Therefore, any of the Company’s coals can be marketed for the electric power generation industry. 
The Company’s proven and probable coal reserves include 87.0 million tons of undeveloped reserves that are classified as high-vol, mid-vol or low-vol metallurgical coal. Additionally, worldwide demand for metallurgical coal allows some of our proven and probable coal reserves, currently classified as thermal coal but that possess certain qualities, to be sold as metallurgical coal. The extent to which we can sell thermal coal as crossover metallurgical coal depends upon a number of factors, including the quality characteristics of the reserve, the specific quality requirements and constraints of the end-use customer and market conditions (which affect whether customers are compelled to substitute lower-quality crossover coal for higher-quality metallurgical coal in their blends to realize economic benefits). The addition of this cross-over market adds additional assurance to the Company that all of its proven and probable coal reserves are commercially marketable. 
The Company assigns coal reserves to each mine within the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The amount of coal we assign to the Pennsylvania Mining Complex generally is sufficient to support mining through the duration of our current mining permit. Under federal law, we must renew our mining permits every five years. All assigned reserves have their required permits or governmental approvals, or there is a high probability that these approvals will be secured. In addition, the Pennsylvania Mining Complex may have access to additional reserves that have not yet been assigned. We refer to these reserves as accessible. Accessible reserves are proven and probable coal reserves that can be accessed by an existing mining complex, utilizing the existing infrastructure of the complex to mine and to process the coal in this area. Mining an accessible reserve does not require additional capital spending beyond that required to extend or to continue the normal progression of the mine, such as the sinking of airshafts or the construction of portal facilities. 
Some reserves may be accessible by more than one mine because of the proximity of many of our mines to one another. In the table below, the accessible reserves indicated for a mine are based on our review of current mining plans and reflect our best judgment as to which mine is most likely to utilize the reserve. Assigned and unassigned coal reserves are proven and probable coal reserves which are either owned or leased. The leases have terms extending up to 30 years and generally provide for renewal through the anticipated life of the associated mine. These renewals are exercisable by the payment of minimum royalties. Under current mining plans, assigned reserves reported will be mined out within the period of existing leases or within the time period of probable lease renewal periods. 
Pennsylvania Mining Complex 
Bailey Mine. The Bailey mine is located in Enon, Pennsylvania. The Bailey Mine is the first mine that CNX developed at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. As of December 31, 2017, the Bailey mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 245.2 million tons of clean recoverable proven and probable coal with an average as-received gross heat content 
13

of approximately 12,900 Btus per pound and an approximate average pounds of SO2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) of 4.03. While operating two longwalls, the production capacity of the Bailey mine is approximately 11.5 million tons of coal per year. Construction of the slope and initial air shaft began in 1982. The slope development reached the coal seam at a depth of approximately 600 feet and, following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1984. Longwall mining production commenced in 1985, and the second longwall was placed into operation in 1987. In 2010, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned, which allowed a large percentage of the Bailey mine to be sealed off. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Bailey mine produced 12.1, 12.1 and 10.2 million tons of coal, respectively. The Bailey mine uses approximately six continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. On average, the longwalls have a panel width (or face length) of approximately 1,500 feet, a panel length of approximately 12,000 feet and a seam height of approximately 7.5 feet. 
Enlow Fork Mine. The Enlow Fork Mine is located directly north of the Bailey Mine. As of December 31, 2017, the Enlow Fork Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 295.5 million tons of clean recoverable proven and probable coal with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,900 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 3.28. While operating two longwalls, the production capacity of the Enlow Fork mine is approximately 11.5 million tons of coal per year. Initial underground development was started from the Bailey mine while the Enlow Fork slope was being constructed. Once the slope bottom was developed and the slope belt became operational, seals were constructed to separate the two mines. Following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1989. Longwall mining production commenced in 1991 with the second longwall coming online in 1992. In 2014, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned and a substantial portion of the Enlow Fork mine was sealed. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Enlow Fork mine produced 9.2, 9.6 and 9.0 million tons of coal, respectively. The Enlow Fork mine uses approximately six continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. On average, the longwalls have a panel width (or face length) of approximately 1,500 feet, a panel length of approximately 12,000 feet and a seam height of approximately 7.5 feet. 
Harvey Mine. The Harvey Mine is located directly east of the Bailey and Enlow Fork Mines. As of December 31, 2017, the Harvey mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 194.8 million tons of clean recoverable proven and probable coal with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,960 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 3.42. While operating one longwall, the production capacity of the Harvey mine is approximately 5.5 million tons of coal per year. Similar to the Enlow Fork mine, the Harvey mine was developed off of the Bailey mine’s slope bottom. Once the slope for the Harvey mine was placed into operation, seals were built to separate the two mines, and the original slope was dedicated solely to the Harvey mine, which eliminated the need to make significant capital expenditures to develop, among other things, a new slope, air shaft and portal facility. Development of the Harvey mine began in 2009, and construction of the supporting surface facilities commenced in 2011. Longwall mining production commenced in March 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Harvey mine produced 4.8, 3.0 and 3.6 million tons of coal, respectively. The Harvey mine uses approximately four continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. The longwall has a panel width (or face length) of approximately 1,500 feet, a panel length of approximately 15,000 feet and a seam height of approximately 6.9 feet. The Harvey mine’s existing infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt and material handling system, has the capacity to add one incremental permanent longwall mining system with additional mine development and capital investment.

(1) | The heat values (gross calorific values) shown for Assigned Operating reserves are based on the 2017 actual quality and five-year forecasted quality for each mine/reserve, assuming that the coal is washed to an extent consistent with normal full-capacity operation of each mine's/complex’s preparation plant. Actual quality is based on laboratory analysis of samples collected from coal shipments delivered in 2017. Forecasted quality is derived from exploration sample analysis results, which have been adjusted to account for anticipated moisture and for the effects of mining and coal preparation. The heat values (gross calorific values) shown for Accessible Reserves are on an as-received basis (dry values obtained from drill hole analyses, adjusted for moisture) and are prorated by the associated Assigned Operating product values to account for similar mining and processing methods.


(2) | Recoverable reserves are calculated based on the area in which mineable coal exists, coal seam thickness, and average density determined by laboratory testing of drill core samples. This calculation is adjusted to account for coal that will not be recovered during mining and for losses that occur if the coal is processed after mining. Reserves tons are reported on an as-received basis, based on the anticipated product moisture. Reserves are reported only for those coal seams that are controlled by ownership or leases.

Title to coal properties that we lease or purchase and the boundaries of these properties are verified by law firms retained by us at the time we lease or acquire the properties. Consistent with industry practice, abstracts and title reports are reviewed and updated approximately five years prior to planned development or mining of the property. If defects in title or boundaries of undeveloped reserves are discovered in the future, control of and the right to mine reserves could be adversely affected.
The following table sets forth, with respect to properties that we lease to other coal operators, the total royalty tonnage and the amount of income (net of related expenses) we received from royalty payments for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Production 
In the year ended December 31, 2017, 100% of the Company's production came from underground mines equipped with longwall mining systems. The Company employs longwall mining systems in our underground mines where the geology is favorable and reserves are sufficient. Underground longwall systems are highly mechanized, capital intensive operations. Mines using longwall systems have a low variable cost structure compared with other types of mines and can achieve high productivity levels compared with those of other underground mining methods. Because the Company has substantial reserves readily suitable to these operations, the Company believes that these longwall mines can increase capacity at a low incremental cost.

The following table shows the production, in millions of tons, for the Company's mines for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the location of each mine, the type of mine, the type of equipment used at each mine, method of transportation and the year each mine was established or acquired by us.

We sell coal produced by our mines and additional coal that is purchased by us for resale from other producers. We maintain a United States sales office in Pittsburgh. In addition, we sell coal through agents and to brokers and unaffiliated trading companies. Approximately 65% of our 2017 coal sales were made to U.S. electric generators, 32% of our 2017 coal sales were priced on export markets and 3% of our 2017 coal sales were made to other domestic customers. Approximately 75% of our 2016 coal sales were made to U.S. electric generators, 22% of our 2016 coal sales were priced on export markets and 3% of our 2016 coal sales were made to other domestic customers. Approximately 71% of our 2015 coal sales were made to U.S. electric generators, 24% of our 2015 coal sales were priced on export markets and 5% of our 2015 coal sales were made to other domestic customers. We had sales to over 35 customers from our 2017 coal operations. During 2017, two customers each comprised over 10% of our coal sales, aggregating approximately 31% of our sales. Annual metallurgical coal revenues for the past three years ranged from $58.3 million to $77.0 million. 
Coal Contracts and Pricing
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships, or through a formalized bidding process. Contract volumes range from a single shipment to multi-year agreements for millions of tons of 
18

coal. The average contract term is between one to three years. As a normal course of business, efforts are made to renew or extend contracts scheduled to expire. Although there are no guarantees, we generally have been successful in renewing or extending contracts in the past. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 68% of all the coal we produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more. 
We expect total consolidated Pennsylvania Mining Complex annual sales to be approximately 27 million tons for 2018 and 2019. Coal pricing for contracts with terms of one year or less is generally fixed. Coal pricing for multiple-year agreements generally provide the opportunity to periodically adjust the contract prices through pricing mechanisms consisting of one or more of the following: 

• | Fixed price contracts with pre-established prices;


• | Periodically negotiated prices that reflect market conditions at the time;


• | Price restricted to an agreed-upon percentage increase or decrease;


• | Base-price-plus-escalation methods which allow for periodic price adjustments based on inflation indices, or other negotiated indices; or


• | Netback pricing

The volume of coal to be delivered is specified in each of our coal contracts. Although the volume to be delivered under the coal contracts is stipulated, the parties may vary the timing of the deliveries within specified limits. Coal contracts typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of certain force majeure events. Force majeure events include, but are not limited to, unexpected significant geological conditions or natural disasters. Depending on the language of the contract, some contracts may terminate upon continuance of an event of force majeure that extends for a period greater than three to twelve months. 
Of our 2017 sales tons, approximately 65% were sold to U.S. electric generators, 32% were priced on export thermal markets and 3% were sold to other domestic customers. In 2017, we derived greater than 10% of our total coal sales revenue from two customers: Duke Energy Corporation (“Duke Energy”) and Xcoal Energy & Resources (“Xcoal”). As of January 1, 2018, we had nine sales agreements with these customers that expire at various times in 2018 and 2019. As of February 16, 2018, CONSOL Energy has entered into an additional contract with Xcoal. It is anticipated that these combined contracts with Xcoal will account for more than 10% of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
During the past three years, our average realization (sales price per ton sold) for coal produced from the PAMC decreased from $56.36/ton in 2015 to $43.31/ton in 2016, and then increased to $45.52/ton in 2017. However, our average realization has since rebounded from a low of $40.61/ton during the second quarter of 2016 to $46.80 during the first quarter of 2017. Pricing for our product depends strongly on conditions in the domestic thermal coal market, which accounted for at least 68% of our total sales volumes in each of 2015, 2016, and 2017. 
The prices we are able to achieve in the domestic thermal market depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the supply-demand balance for Northern Appalachian coal, (ii) prices for other competing sources of energy used for electricity generation, such as natural gas, (iii) power prices in the regions we serve, (iv) prices for coals from other basins (including the Central Appalachian Basin, Illinois Basin, and Powder River Basin) that compete in these same regions, and (v) pricing under our longer-term contracts, which may have been entered into under different market conditions. For example, the 19% decrease in our average realization from 2015 to 2017 occurred during a period when Henry Hub spot natural gas prices averaged relatively lower than they had during the previous couple of years, decreasing from an average of $4.05/mmBtu in 2013-2014 to an average of $2.71/mmBtu in 2015-2017. These lower natural gas prices, coupled with increased capacity from new natural gas combined-cycle power plants, put pressure on power prices and on the demand for coal-fired electric power generation. Based on the latest data from the EIA, U.S. coal-fired generation averaged approximately 20% lower in 2015-2017 than in 2013-2014, and average day-ahead power prices at the PJM Western hub, which correlates with prices received by several of our top domestic customer plants, averaged 29% lower in the same period-to-period comparison. Moreover, abnormally mild weather during the winter of 2015-2016 caused U.S. power plant coal inventories to swell, and additional mild weather in the winter of 2016-2017 and summer of 2017 prolonged the impact on domestic coal demand as power plants required fewer new coal deliveries while they worked to draw down their coal stockpiles to more-normal levels. These factors affected the prices that we were able to achieve in the domestic thermal markets as older contracts rolled off and were replaced by new contracts.
At the same time, imbalances in global supply and demand for coal caused substantial variability in pricing in the two other primary markets we serve - the export thermal market and the export metallurgical market - during the 2015-2017 period. For example, prompt month API 2 index prices (the benchmark price reference for coal imported into northwest Europe) averaged about 22% lower during the first six months of 2016 than they did during the first six months of 2015, and quarterly global coking coal benchmark prices also averaged about 27% lower during the same period-to-period comparison. Pricing in all three of our 
19

primary markets began to recover during the latter part of 2016, and in calendar year 2017, the API 2 index averaged 42% higher than in 2016, and global coking coal prices were up by an even greater percentage year-over-year. This helped to drive the rebound in pricing for our coal noted above.
Terminal Services 
In 2017, approximately 14.3 million tons of coal were shipped through the CONSOL Marine Terminal owned by our subsidiary, CONSOL Marine Terminals LLC. Approximately 53% of the tonnage shipped was produced by the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars. It is also one of the few terminals in the United States served by two railroads, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation Inc. CONSOL Marine Terminal has significant storage capacity of 1.1 million tons with more than thirty acres of capacity for stockpiles. The facility possesses extensive blending capabilities, and has handled over 10 million tons of coal per year on average since 2010, with a potential maximum throughput capacity of 15 million tons annually. 
Non-Core Coal Assets and Surface Properties 
We own significant coal assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans. We continually explore the monetization of these non-core assets by means of sale, lease, contribution to joint ventures, or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our stockholders. 
Distribution
Coal is transported from the Company’s mining operations to customers by railroad cars, trucks, vessels or a combination of these means of transportation. Most customers negotiate their own transportation rates and we employ transportation specialists who negotiate freight and equipment agreements with various transportation suppliers, including railroads, barge lines, terminal operators, ocean vessel brokers and trucking companies for certain customers. 
Seasonality
Our business has historically experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonal changes. Demand for coal-fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating, respectively. Conversely, mild weather can result in weaker demand for our coal. Adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards or floods, can impact our ability to transport coal over our overland conveyor systems and to transport our coal by rail.
Competition 
The coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal producing basins of the United States, and we compete with many of these producers, including those who export coal abroad. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers’ local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to our customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and foreign coal consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel.

Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our coal mining operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations. Regulations relating to our operations require us to obtain permits and other licenses; reclaim and restore our properties after mining operations have been completed; store, transport and dispose of materials used or generated by our operations; manage surface subsidence from underground mining; control water and air emissions; protect wetlands and endangered plant and wildlife; and to ensure employee health and safety. Furthermore, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our coal.
Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining, and the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our coal mining operations or our customers’ ability to use our coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we and our customers’ business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Environmental Laws
Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of coal mining operations, both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by requiring us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions.
The CAA also indirectly and more significantly affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers. Coal contains impurities, such as sulfur, mercury and other constituents, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Carbon dioxide (“CO2”), a regulated greenhouse gas (“GHG”), is also emitted when coal is burned. Environmental regulations governing emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants increase the costs to operate and could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned, including plants to which the Company sells coal, and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future.
In early 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for coal- and oil-fired power plants which also have a negative effect on coal- generating facilities. The Utility Maximum Control Technology (“UMACT”) rule requires more stringent NSPS for particulate matter (“PM”), Sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and nitrogen oxides (“NOX”) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”) rule requires new mercury and air toxic standards. In November 2012, the EPA published a notice of reconsideration of certain aspects of the UMACT and MATS rules. Following reconsideration in April 2013 and again in April 2014, the EPA promulgated final UMACT and MATS rules in November 2014. The rule was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 and sent back to the D.C. Circuit Court to determine whether to remand and allow the EPA to address the rule’s deficiencies or to vacate and nullify the rule; nevertheless most coal-fired electric power generators have already taken steps to comply with the rule. On April 18, 2017 the EPA asked the Court to delay arguments over MATS to allow the Trump Administration time to fully review the findings. On April 21, 2017, the Court granted the requested stay. 
The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for certain pollutants and the CAA identifies two types of NAAQS. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of “sensitive” populations such as asthmatics, children and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation and buildings. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (“ppb”) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule could have a large impact on the coal mining industry as states would be required to update their permitting standards to meet these potentially unachievable limits. Several states have filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals. On April 7, 2017, the EPA advised the Court that it intended to reconsider the final rule. On April 11, 2017, the Court stayed the litigation pending further action by the EPA. On August 10, 2017, EPA withdrew a previously-announced one-year extension to the compliance deadline.

On January 17, 2018, New York and Connecticut filed suit against the EPA alleging that the EPA violated the CAA by failing to adequately prevent ozone transport from downwind states, including Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Delaware filed a similar lawsuit in 2016. If the states were successful, the EPA and the downstream states could be required to implement lower ozone levels through the states’ implementation plans, which could, in turn, result in lower ozone emissions thresholds for state permitting. 
On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized a rule known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, as well as byproducts, fine particulate matter and ozone by requiring states to limit emissions from sources that “contribute significantly” to noncompliance with air quality standards for the criteria air pollutants. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in “nonattainment” for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In April 2014, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that vacated the rule. Following remand and briefing the D.C. Circuit Court, in October 2014, granted a motion to lift a stay of the rule and allow the EPA to modify the CSAPR compliance deadline by three-years, setting the stage for issuance of the proposed rule. Implementation of CSAPR Phase 1 began in 2015, with Phase 2 scheduled to begin in 2017. On September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR for the 2008 ozone NAAQS by issuing the final CSAPR Update. As of May 2017, this rule limits summertime (May - September) NOX emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States.
On March 27, 2012, the EPA published its proposed NSPS for CO2 emissions from new coal-powered electric generating units. The proposed rule would have applied to new power plants and to existing plants that make major modifications. If the rule had been adopted as proposed, only new coal-fired power plants with CO2 capture and storage (“CCS”) could have met the proposed emission limits. Commercial scale CCS is not likely to be available in the near future, and if available, it may make coal-fired electric generation units uneconomical compared to new gas-fired electric generation units. On January 8, 2014, the EPA re-proposed NSPS for CO2 for new fossil fuel fired power plants and rescinded the rules that were proposed on April 13, 2012.
On September 20, 2013, the EPA issued a new proposal, “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants”, to establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. On June 2, 2014, the EPA announced the Clean Power Plan (“CPP Rule”) rules intended to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under this proposed rule, the EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel- fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA proposed state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the state-specific goals. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the CPP Rule and the Carbon Pollution Standards for New Power Plants. 
Numerous petitions challenging the CPP Rule have been consolidated into one case, West Virginia v. EPA. While the litigation is still ongoing at the circuit court level, a mid-litigation application to the Supreme Court resulted in a stay of the CPP Rule. On September 27, 2016, an en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments in the case. The decision, originally expected in early 2017, has been stayed as a result of a March 28, 2017 executive order directing the EPA to begin the process of reviewing and possibly rescinding the CPP Rule. The EPA filed a motion and the motion was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit requesting the stay while the EPA conducts their review of the CPP Rule. If the review does not result in any rule changes, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will rule on the legality of the CPP Rule. On October 16, 2017, the EPA formally proposed repeal of the CPP, which relies on a re-interpretation of CAA 111(d), on which the CPP was originally premised. 
Similarly, various states and industry groups challenged the Carbon Pollution Standards for New Power Plants. That litigation has also been stayed following the March 28, 2017 executive order.
The current Administration’s executive order promoting energy independence and economic growth issued on March 28, 2017 requires the review of existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources. On October 25, 2017, the EPA issued a report in compliance with the March 28, 2017 executive order recommending changes to the NAAQS and NSPS programs. It also recommended that the EPA’s regulations consider employment impacts and that the EPA develop a database of industry-knowledgeable contacts. The review of existing regulations may not result in any changes and any changes made to existing regulations may not produce the intended favorable results desired by the new Administration. The executive order also directed the Council on Environmental Quality to rescind its final guidance entitled, “Final Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate Change in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews.” The guidance previously directed agencies to consider proposed actions and their effects on climate change (GHG emissions would have been a key indicator being assessed under any National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) review). Such review considerations may have created additional delays or costs in any NEPA review processes for energy producers and generators and may have prevented the acquisition of any necessary federal approvals for energy producers and generators.

Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding state laws affect our coal operations by regulating discharges into surface waters. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The CWA and corresponding state laws include requirements for: improvement of designated “impaired waters” (i.e., not meeting state water quality standards) through the use of effluent limitations; anti-degradation regulations which protect state designated “high quality/exceptional use” streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges; requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, selenium and dissolved solids; requirements to minimize impacts and compensate for unavoidable impacts resulting from discharges of fill materials to regulated streams and wetlands; and requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. In addition, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure requirements of the CWA apply to all the Company’s operations that use or produce fluids and require the implementation of plans to address any spills and the installation of secondary containment around all storage tanks. These requirements may cause us to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
However, on June 29, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule effective August 28, 2015, clarifying which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (the “2015 Clean Water Rule”), which imposed additional permitting obligations on our operations. On August 27, 2015, the District Court for the District of North Dakota blocked implementation of the rule in 13 states. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit blocked implementation of the rule nationwide. On February 28, 2017, Presidential Executive Order on “Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by reviewing the ‘Waters of the United States’ Rule” was issued. In response, on June 27, 2017, the EPA, Department of the Army, and the Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule proposing to re-codify the definition of “Waters of the United States” to the text that existed prior to the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The proposed rule provides certainty in the interim period until a subsequent rulemaking on the definition of “waters of the United States” can be finalized. On January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that challenges to the Clean Water Rule are properly decided in federal district courts and not federal courts of appeal. This decision implicates the nationwide injunction previously enacted by the Sixth Circuit, but has no impact on the current Administration’s efforts to replace the rulemaking. Additionally, on January 31, 2018, the EPA finalized a rule delaying the effective date of the 2015 Clean Water Rule for two years.
In order to obtain a permit for certain coal mining activities, including the construction of coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments, an operator must obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Beginning in early 2009, the EPA took a number of initiatives that have resulted in delays and obstruction of the issuance of such permits for surface mining operations in the Appalachian states, including Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located. Increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority, coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements imposed by the EPA, has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our results, financial condition and cash flows. In 2010, the EPA proposed options for the regulation of Coal Combustion Residuals from the electric power sector as either hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the first national regulations for the disposal of Coal Combustion Receivables from electric utilities and independent power producers under RCRA. On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized these regulations under the solid waste provisions (Subtitle D) of RCRA and not the hazardous waste provisions (Subtitle C) which became effective on October 19, 2015. The EPA affirms in the preamble to the final rule that “this rule does not apply to Coal Combustion Receivables placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines.” Instead, “the U.S. Department of Interior and the EPA will address the management of Coal Combustion Receivables in mine fills in a separate regulatory action(s).” On September 14, 2017, EPA stated its intention to reconsider certain Coal Combustion Receivables provisions. It is unclear whether this reconsideration will result in changes to the Coal Combustion Receivables regulations. 
On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (“ELG”), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. On September 13, 2017, the EPA finalized a rule postponing certain compliance dates for specific waste streams subject to the effluent limitations for a period of two years.The combined effect of the Coal Combustion Receivables and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards.

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”) establishes minimum national operational and reclamation standards for all surface mines as well as most aspects of underground mines. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (“OSM”) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. States that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA and OSM's regulations and in many instances have done so. The Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs. In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. This fee is currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021.
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are provided by us and are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety-bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral. Any failure by us to maintain, or our inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
Excess Spoil, Coal Mine Waste, Diversions, and Buffer Zones for Perennial and Intermittent Streams. The OSM has issued final amendments to regulations concerning stream buffer zones, stream channel diversions, excess spoil, and coal mine waste to comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 20, 2014, which vacated the stream buffer zone rule that was published December 12, 2008. On July 27, 2015, the OSM published the proposed Stream Protection Rule (“SPR”). After much debate and thousands of comments, the final SPR was published by the OSM in the Federal Register on December 20, 2016. The final SPR requires the restoration of the physical form, hydrologic function, and ecological function of the segment of a perennial or intermittent stream that a permittee mines through. Additionally, it requires that the post-mining surface configuration of the reclaimed mine site include a drainage pattern, including ephemeral streams, similar to the pre-mining drainage pattern, with exceptions for stability, topographical changes, fish and wildlife habitat, etc. The rule also requires the establishment of a 100-foot-wide streamside vegetative corridor of native species (including riparian species, when appropriate) along each bank of any restored or permanently-diverted perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream. This rulemaking was nullified by Congress under the Congressional Review Act in February 2017. 
Health and Safety Laws
Mine Safety. Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols and with new regulations the volume of civil penalties has increased. Recent actions taken by federal and state governments include requiring:

• | the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of proximity detection devices on continuous miner machines;


• | the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours;


• | the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground;


• | additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees;


• | more stringent rock dusting requirements; and


• | the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners.

On October 2, 2015, the MSHA published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. The rulemaking record for this proposed rule was closed on December 15, 2016, but on January 9, 2017, MSHA published a notice reopening the record and extending the comment period for this proposed rule for 30 days. On January 15, 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring underground coal mine operations to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in accidents involving life-threatening injuries and death. The final rule became effective March 15, 2015 and included a phased in schedule for newly manufactured and in-service equipment.
24

In 2010, MSHA rolled out the “End Black Lung, Act Now” initiative. As a result, MSHA implemented a new final rule on August 1, 2014 to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust including using the new Personal Dust Monitor technology. This final rule was implemented in three phases. The first phase began on August 1, 2014 and utilized the current gravimetric sampling device to take full shift dust samples from the current designated occupations and areas. It also required additional record keeping and immediate corrective action in the event of overexposure. The second phase began on February 1, 2016 and required additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor (“CPDM”) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CPDM equipment was purchased and was placed into service which was required to meet compliance with the new rule. Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians were hired in order to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The final phase of the rule went into effect on August 1, 2016. The current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 Miners.

Black Lung Legislation.  Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to:

• | current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease;


• | certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease; and


• | a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a coal miner's last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) of 2010 made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner's work. Second, it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner's death. The changes have increased the cost to us of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for our portion of black lung claims.
Other State and Local Laws Related to Our Coal Business
Ownership of Coal Rights. The Company acquires ownership or leasehold rights to coal properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the coal industry, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to coal rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of coal rights. Given our experience as a coal producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our coal control. Prior to the commencement of development operations on coal properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. We have completed title work on substantially all of our coal producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry. 
Permits
Environmental Proceedings. On September 4, 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) provided notice that it required additional time to review the technical merits of a prior permit submission (the “Application”) for continued longwall mining within the 4L panel under Polen Run at the Bailey Mine, in light of a recent Environmental Hearing Board (the “EHB”) decision, which is discussed further below. As a result, the longwall was idled at that time and workforce adjustments were made, pending further developments with the DEP and permit submission. This was the first time in the 35-year history of the Bailey Mine that a needed mining permit had not been received in a timely fashion. 
As noted above, the DEP’s consideration of the Application related to part of an August 2017 EHB decision that impacts the application of DEP-required stream mitigation techniques, specifically the installation of synthetic stream-channel liner systems. The EHB is the quasi-judicial agency that hears appeals of DEP permitting decisions. The EHB decision held, in part, that the requirement to install a stream-channel liner system constituted impermissible pollution under applicable environmental laws. That determination had direct and specific implications for the Application with respect to undermining one particular stream, 
25

Polen Run, in the panel for which the DEP was proposing to require the installation of the stream-channel liner system as a mitigation measure. The DEP requested alternative mitigation measures for consideration, which CNX supplied. Given the potential for a protracted review, CNX felt it prudent to temporarily idle the longwall and dismantle and relocate it to another panel where it held an operating permit. 
To that end, on September 18, 2017, CNX issued a press release stating that the DEP was requiring additional time to evaluate the approval of the Application and that, as a result of this ongoing evaluation, CNX determined to move the longwall to another permitted panel in order to resume operations. The longwall was moved and resumed operations the first week of October 2017. CNX management implemented several measures to mitigate the production impact from this delay, including working additional unscheduled shifts as compared to the previous five and a half day schedule. Company management continued to take steps to mitigate the production impact from this delay and worked closely with the necessary agencies to obtain operating permits to allow for continuity of longwall mining operations. In November 2017, the DEP issued permitting authorizing revised longwall mining plans in the 5L Panel and longwall mining in Panels 6L through 8L. 
The Application also sought authorization for continued longwall mining under the Polen Run stream in the Bailey Mine 5L Panel. Additionally, the Application has been revised to conform to the DEP’s interpretation of the August 2017 EHB decision. The Application proposes to conduct stream mitigation (grouting) through techniques approved by the DEP under existing permits. The Application remains under the DEP’s review with respect to longwall mining under the Polen Run stream in the Bailey Mine 5L panel. 
The PAMC operates five total longwalls, with many of the approved permits as far out as ten years in advance.
