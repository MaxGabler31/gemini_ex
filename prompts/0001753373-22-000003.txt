Item 1. Description of Business
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
Inky was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2018. The Company (“we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is engaged in mobile applications development. Inky helps the User decide what and where they want to ink without having to get an actual tattoo. User simply utilizes Inky to have preview of a proposed tattoo. Then the tattoo technician utilizes the User phone’s camera to position and overlay the proposed tattoo. Users will be able to download our App through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Market.
 
We plan to generate revenue from sales, or downloads, of our App and from advertisements published on our ad supported app titles.
 
The member of our management has accumulated significant experience, knowledge and contacts across the key disciplines in the digital and mobile industries. This encompasses digital and social media sales, advertising, operations, and technology and product development and deployment. We expect to leverage management’s industry experience and contacts to our advantage.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We plan to market, sell and distribute our Inky Apps exclusively through Apple’s App Store and through the Google Play Store, the largest direct-to-consumer digital storefronts. We expect that a majority of our revenues will be derived from sales on the Apple App Store.
Competition
 
Developing and distributing Apps is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. With respect to competing for consumers of our app, we will compete primarily on the basis of app quality, brand and customer reviews. We will compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the storefront owner, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands, properties and other content.
 
We believe that our small size will provide us a competitive edge for the time being and allow us to make quick decisions as to product development to take advantage of consumer preferences at a particular point in time.
 
With respect to our App, we compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including industry leaders such as Activision, DeNA, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Apploft, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Nexon, Warner Brothers and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including Kabam, Machine Zone, Rovio, Storm 8/Team Lava and Supercell. We could also face increased competition if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook or Yahoo, choose to enter or expand in the apps space or develop competing apps. One of the main competitors is the InkHunter, whose prototype application is similar to ours. But we believe we are also a good competitor.

In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals in all of our segments who are able to create and launch Apps and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise.
 
Most of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, including:
 · significantly greater financial and personnel resources;
 · stronger brand and consumer recognition;
 · the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;
 · more substantial intellectual property of their own;
 · lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale; and
 · broader distribution and presence.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, and sweepstakes and contests. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
Employees
 
We are a start-up company and currently have one employee - Ioanna Kallidou, our president, treasurer, secretary and director. We intend to outsource any additional services if the business requires.
