Overview
 
enVVeno Medical Corporation is a med-tech company focused on improving the standard of care in the treatment of venous disease. We are developing tissue-based solutions that are designed to be life sustaining or life enhancing for patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI). CVI occurs when valves inside of the veins of the leg fail, resulting in insufficient blood being returned to the heart. We aim to develop products to address large unmet medical needs by either offering treatments where none currently exist or by substantially increasing the current standards of care. Our lead product is a porcine based device to be surgically implanted in the deep venous system of the leg and is called the VenoValve®. The VenoValve is currently being evaluated in the SAVVE U.S. pivotal trial for the purpose of obtaining approval to market and sell the device from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Our team of officers and directors has been affiliated with numerous medical devices that have received FDA approval or CE marking and that have been commercially successful. We develop and manufacture our products in a 14,507 sq. ft. leased manufacturing facility in Irvine, California, which has been ISO 13485-2016 certified for the design, development and manufacturing of tissue based implantable medical devices.
 
On September 21, 2021, we announced that we were changing our name from Hancock Jaffe Laboratories, Inc. to enVVeno Medical Corporation and that our development strategy is to focus on the treatment of deep venous CVI. In addition to the VenoValve, we announced that we have a second product in the early stages of development called enVVe. In connection with this change in strategy, we indicated that we are not pursuing further development of the CoreoGraft, which is now outside of our primary focus area.
 
VenoValve
 
The VenoValve is a porcine based valve developed at enVVeno Medical to be implanted in the deep venous system of the leg to treat severe CVI. By reducing reflux, and lowering pressure (venous hypertension) within the deep venous system of the leg, the VenoValve has the potential to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of severe deep venous CVI, including the potential to heal recurring venous leg ulcers. The current version of the VenoValve is designed to be implanted into the femoral vein of the patient in an open surgical procedure via a 5-to-6-inch incision in the upper thigh.
 
There are presently no FDA approved medical devices to address valvular incompetence in the deep venous system, or effective treatments for deep venous CVI. Current treatment options include compression garments, or constant leg elevation, and would care for venous ulcers. These treatments are generally ineffective, as they attempt to alleviate the symptoms of CVI without addressing the underlying causes of the disease. In addition, we believe compliance with compression garments and leg elevation is extremely low, especially among the elderly. The premise behind the VenoValve is that by reducing the underlying causes of CVI, reflux and venous hypertension, the debilitating symptoms of CVI will decrease, resulting in improvement in the quality of the lives of CVI sufferers.
 
We estimate that there are approximately 2.4 million people in the U.S. that suffer from deep venous CVI due to valvular incompetence.

Background
 
Chronic venous disease (“CVD”) is the world’s most prevalent chronic disease. CVD is generally classified using a standardized system known as CEAP (clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological). The CEAP system consists of seven clinical classifications (C0 to C6) with C5 to C6 being the most severe cases of CVD.
 
Chronic Venous Insufficiency (“CVI”) is a subset of CVD and is generally used to describe patients with C4 to C6 CVD. CVI is a debilitating condition that affects the venous system of the leg causing pain, swelling, edema, skin changes, and ulcerations. The human leg contains three vein systems: the deep vein system, the superficial vein system, and the perforator vein system which connects the deep system to the superficial system. The deep venous system is located below the muscle and facia in the center portion of the leg and is responsible for approximately 90% of the blood flow. In order for blood to return to the heart from the foot, ankle, and lower leg, the calf muscle serves as a pump and pushes the blood up the veins of the leg against gravity and through a series of one-way valves. Each valve is supposed to open as blood passes through, and then close as blood progresses up the veins of the leg to the next valve. CVI occurs when the one-way valves in the veins of the leg fail and become incompetent. When the valves fail, gravity causes the blood to flow backwards and in the wrong direction (reflux). As blood pools in the lower leg, pressure inside the veins increases (venous hypertension). Reflux, and the resulting venous hypertension, causes the leg to swell, resulting in debilitating pain, and in the most severe cases, venous ulcers. The VenoValve is being developed to treat CVI in the deep venous system with a focus on severe patients with C4b, C5 and C6 CVI.
 
We estimate that approximately 2.4 million people in the U.S. have C5 to C6 CVI due to reflux in the deep venous system, including patients that develop venous leg ulcers (C6 patients). Over one million new severe cases of CVI occur each year in the U.S., mostly from patients who have experienced a deep vein thrombosis or blood clot. The average patient seeking treatment of a venous ulcer spends as much as $30,000 a year on wound care, and the total direct medical costs from venous ulcer sufferers in the U.S. has been estimated to exceed $38 billion a year. Aside from the direct medical costs, severe CVI sufferers experience a significantly reduced quality of life. Daily activities such as preparing meals, housework, and personal hygiene (washing and bathing) become difficult due to reduced mobility. For many severe CVI sufferers, intense pain, which frequently occurs at night, prevents patients from getting adequate sleep. Severe CVI sufferers are known to miss approximately 40% more work days than the average worker. A high percentage of venous ulcer patients also experience severe itching, leg swelling, and an odorous discharge. Wound dressing changes, which occur several times a week, can be extremely painful. Venous ulcers from deep venous CVI are very difficult to heal, and a significant percentage of venous ulcers remain unhealed for more than a year. Even if healed, recurrence rates for venous ulcers are known to be high (20% to 40%) within the first year and as high as 60% after five years.

VenoValve Clinical Status
 
After consultation with the FDA, and as a precursor to the U.S. pivotal trial, we conducted a small first-in-human study for the VenoValve in Colombia which included eleven (11) patients. In addition to providing safety and efficacy data, the purpose of the first-in-human study was to provide proof of concept, and to provide valuable feedback to make any necessary product modifications or adjustments to our surgical implantation procedure for the VenoValve prior to conducting the U.S. pivotal trial. Endpoints for the VenoValve first-in-human study included safety (device related adverse events), reflux, measured by doppler, a VCSS score used by the clinician to measure disease severity and progress, a VAS score used by the patient to measure pain, and a quality of life measurement.
 
Final results from the one (1) year first-in-human study were presented at the Charing Cross International Symposium in April of 2021. Among the eleven (11) patients in the study, reflux improved an average of 54%, Venous Clinical Severity Scores (“VCSSs”) improved an average of 56%, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores, which are used by patients to measure pain, improved an average of 76%, all at one (1) year when compared to pre-surgery levels. VCSS scores are commonly used by clinicians in practice and in clinical trials to objectively assess outcomes in the treatment of venous disease, and include ten characteristics including pain, inflammation, skin changes such as pigmentation and induration, the number of active ulcers, and ulcer duration. The improvement in VCSS scores is significant and indicates the VenoValve patients who had severe CVI pre-surgery, had mild CVI or the complete absence of disease at one-year post surgery.
 
There were no device related safety incidences during the one (1) year first-in-human study. Non-device related safety incidences were minor and included one (1) fluid pocket (which was aspirated), intolerance from Coumadin anticoagulation therapy, three (3) minor wound infections (treated with antibiotics), and one occlusion due to patient non-compliance with anti-coagulation therapy.
 
In preparation for the VenoValve U.S. pivotal trial, on March 5, 2021, we submitted an IDE application with the FDA.
 
An investigational device exemption or IDE from the FDA is required before a medical device company can proceed with a pivotal trial for a class III medical device. On April 1, 2021, we received notification from the FDA that our IDE application was approved. We have named the U.S. pivotal trial for the VenoValve the SAVVE (Surgical Anti-reflux Veno Valve Endoprosthesis) study. It is a prospective, non-blinded, single arm, multi-center study of seventy-five (75) CVI patients to be enrolled at up to 20 U.S. sites.
 
No product modifications for the VenoValve were necessary following the first-in-human study and the SAVVE trial is evaluating the same device that was used in the first-in-human study. Endpoints for the SAVVE trial mirror those endpoints used for the first-in-human study. The primary safety endpoint for the pivotal trial is a material adverse safety event (mortality, deep wound infection, major bleeding, ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) in no more than twenty six percent (26%) of the patients at one (1) month post implantation, and the primary effectiveness endpoint for the pivotal trial is improvement in reflux of at least thirty percent (30%), measured at six (6) months post VenoValve implantation. In the first-in-human study there were no reported material adverse safety events at one (1) month post implantation, and reflux improved an average of fifty six percent (56%) at six (6) months post implantation. VCSS scoring to measure disease manifestations, VAS scores to measure pain, and quality of life measurements will also be monitored in the study.

On August 3, 2020, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation status to the VenoValve. The FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program was established to enable priority review for devices that provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The goal of the FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program is to provide patients and health care providers with timely access to medical devices by speeding up their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the FDA’s mission to protect and promote public health.
 
At the end of the VenoValve first-in-human study, eight (8) study participants agreed to additional monitoring. In August of 2021, longer term follow-up data was presented at the Society of Vascular Surgery Conference in San Diego, for the cohort of eight (8) patients. That data indicated no recurrences of the severe CVI that was present pre-VenoValve, including no ulcer recurrences for those patients whose venous ulcers had healed following VenoValve surgery. There were no reported safety issues from the end of one (1) year first-in-human study to the end of the two (2) year reporting period. In addition, the patients continued to improve, reporting 63%, 60%, and 93%, average improvements in reflux, VCSS, and VAS scores, respectively, at an average of two (2) years post VenoValve surgery compared to pre-VenoValve levels.
 
In October of 2021, we announced that the first patient in the SAVVE pivotal trial underwent successful VenoValve implantation surgery and had been discharged from the hospital. The surgery was performed by Dr. Adriana Laser, associate professor of surgery at Albany Medical College and a vascular surgeon with Albany Med Vascular Surgery. As of December 31, 2021, ten (10) of our clinical trial sites were activated and eligible to enroll patients in the SAVVE pivotal trial. As of March 24, 2022 we have sixteen (16) clinical trial sites that are active to enroll patients in the SAVVE trial and expect to have nineteen (19) active sites by March 31, 2022. Also, as of March 24, 2022, we have completed nine (9) successful surgeries in the SAVVE pivotal trial for the VenoValve. We expect to have our tenth surgery completed by March 31, 2022.
 
The resurgence of COVID and the Omicron variant had both direct and indirect consequences on our clinical trial. Several of our clinical sites put elective surgeries on hold and prohibited potential study subjects from coming to the hospital for screening. Further, as reported in the media, COVID resurgences put an enormous strain on all hospital resources including clinical staffs. In addition to caring for the influx of COVID patients, hospitals become short staffed due to their own employees’ COVID sicknesses, resulting in clinical staff being reassigned to cover the shortfall. The lack of available clinical personnel both slows enrollment and impacts the speed at which we can activate clinical sites.
 
Finally, COVID impacts our patient population. Patients with COVID or who have had COVID within ninety (90) days of their screening, are excluded from our study until after the ninety (90) day period has passed. In addition, concerns about getting COVID impact the patients’ willingness to undergo an elective surgical procedure with a one-night hospital stay. As hospital clinical operations return to more normal levels, our goal is to fully enroll the SAVVE pivotal trial by the end of 2022 or the beginning of 2023. We continue to monitor the ongoing overall impact of COVID on the SAVVE clinical trial and will issue updates when appropriate.
 
In February of 2021, we raised $41.4 million of capital in a public offering of our common stock. In September of 2021, we raised $20 million dollars of capital in a registered direct offering priced at the market under Nasdaq rules and purchased by a fund managed by Perceptive Advisors, a leading life sciences investment firm. We finished 2021 with approximately $55 million of cash. At our existing cash burn rate of approximately $4 million per quarter, we should have sufficient cash to fund operations through the end of 2024 and into 2025. With primary endpoints following full enrollment in the SAVVE pivotal trial of thirty (30) days for safety, and six (6) months for effectiveness, we expect to have primary endpoint data well in advance of the need to raise additional capital.

Government Regulation
 
Our product candidates and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our product candidates are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, distribution, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
PMA Approval Pathway
 
Class III devices such as the VenoValve generally require pre-market approval (PMA) before they can be marketed in the U.S. The PMA review and approval process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA also must contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
 
The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval, or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The VenoValve will require the approval of a PMA.
 
Clinical Trials in Support of PMA
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. The VenoValve required IDE applications prior to human testing in the United States, and we believe any future products such as the enVVE will also require IDE applications before human testing in the United States.
 
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 
In addition to IDE approval, a human, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the study, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.

Post-market Regulation
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: establishing registration and device listing with the FDA; QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; requirements related to promotional activities; clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA; and post-market surveillance activities and regulations.
 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
 
Each country or territory outside of the U.S. has its own rules and regulations with respect to the manufacture, marketing and sale of medical devices. For example, in December of 2018, we received regulatory approval from Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos, the Colombian equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for our first-in-human study for the VenoValve in Colombia. At this time, other than the first-in-human trial in Colombia, we have not determined which countries outside of the U.S., if any, we will seek approval for our product candidates.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we will offer the venous disease treatment market a compelling value proposition with the launch of our product candidates, if approved, for the following reasons:

● | We have extensive experience of proprietary processing and manufacturing methodology specifically applicable to the design, processing, manufacturing and sterilization of our biologic tissue devices. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
