Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview

TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“TOMI”, “we” and “our”) is a global bacteria decontamination and infectious disease control company, providing environmental solutions for indoor surface decontamination through the manufacturing, sales, service and licensing of our SteraMist® brand of products, including SteraMist® BIT™, a low percentage (7.8%) hydrogen peroxide-based fog or mist that uses Binary Ionization Technology (BIT™). Our solution and process are environmentally friendly because the only by-product from our decontamination process is oxygen and humidity. Our solution is organically listed in the United States and Canada as a sustainable green product with no or very little carbon footprint. Most of our competitors in the disinfection space leave significant byproducts and are corrosive. SteraMist is noncorrosive and does not damage equipment or facilities.

Our SteraMist® is a patented technology that produces ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (iHP™) using cold plasma science created under a grant by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Our EPA registered BIT™ Solution is composed of a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide converted to iHP™ after passing the trade secret blended solution including its sole active ingredient of 7.8% hydrogen peroxide through an atmospheric cold plasma arc. The newly formed iHP™ fog and mist consists of submicron’s to 3-micron radical particles that are carried throughout the treatment area in a fog or mist moving with the same velocity and characteristics of a gas. This allows the ionized hydrogen peroxide fog or mist to affect all surfaces and air space throughout the targeted treatment area, over, above and beyond the ability of manual cleaning and many other disinfection decontamination processes. Proprietary ingredients accelerate mist and fog dispersion by reducing evaporation time and treatment duration. iHP™ damages pathogenic organisms through the oxidation of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. SteraMist® no-touch disinfection and or decontamination treat areas mechanically, causing cellular disruptions and/or dysfunctions resulting in a 6-log (99.9999%) and greater kill or inactivation of all pathogens in the treatment area. Our DARPA-originated technology kills on contact with no residue.

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), we are required to register with the EPA and certain state regulatory authorities as a seller of disinfectants. In June 2015, SteraMist® BIT™ was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant and general broad-spectrum surface disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. SteraMist® BIT™ now holds EPA registrations (# 90150-2) for mold control, and air and surface remediation (# 90150-1). In February 2016, we expanded our label with the EPA to include Clostridium difficile Spores and MRSA, as well as the influenza (Avian) virus h1n1, which we believe has better positioned us to penetrate all industries including the biodefense and healthcare industry. In August 2017, our EPA label was further expanded to include efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. As of January 27, 2017, our technology is one of 53 of the EPA’s “Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores”, as published on the EPA’s K List. Further, in December 2017, SteraMist® was included in the EPA’s list G (Norovirus), L (Ebola) and M (Avian Flu). In March 2020, our EPA label was further amended to include Emerging Viral Pathogens claims, thus meeting the criteria against Enveloped viruses and Large Non-enveloped viruses and included on List N (Emerging Viral Pathogens including SARS-CoV-2). In 2021, the EPA granted SteraMist® BIT™ 0.35% hydrogen peroxide – EPA registration number 90150-3.

SteraMist® BIT™ brings to the world a mechanical and automated method of cleaning using innovative technology and EPA registered Hospital-HealthCare disinfectant, which improves and upgrades existing disinfecting and cleaning protocols that mitigates the risk of liability in a facility with transmission of resistant infectious pathogens.  We maintain this registration in all fifty (50) states, Washington DC, Canada, and registration and or importation rights in approximately thirty-five (35) other countries as of March 28,2022.

Our Technology

BIT™ was initially developed in response to Amerithrax, the weaponized anthrax spore attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11, 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. BIT™ is a patented process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, producing a fine aqueous mist (0.3-3 um in diameter) that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (“ROS”), mostly hydroxyl radicals (“OH”). ROS cause damage to pathogenic and resistant organisms, such as bacteria, bacteria spores, viruses, mold spores, other fungi and yeast, via oxidation of proteins carbohydrates, lipids and rendering the building blocks of nature’s amino acids, DNA and RNA inactive - leading to cellular death, disruption and/or dysfunction.

Testing detailed by DARPA demonstrated these hydroxyl radicals aggressively break the double bonds and other bonds in bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, fungus spores, viruses and certain biological and chemical warfare agents and neutralize their threat while producing nontoxic by-products. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after our EPA-registered solution passes through an atmospheric cold plasma arc, which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, the net result - our .OH hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as iHP™. This patented process allows these hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity, while seeking to attach with any and all surfaces within the proximity of TOMI’s mist.

The sole active ingredient of BIT™ is a low percentage (7.8%) Hydrogen Peroxide and is represented by the TOMI™ SteraMist® brand of products. Our technology produces a germ-killing aerosol that moves throughout a space like a gas. Our technology is able to efficiently and effectively kill pathogenic and resistant organisms in the air and on the surfaces without damaging delicate equipment or computers, and the only by-product is oxygen and water in the form of humidity.

Each and every SteraMist® product utilizes the innovative and easy-to-use power of Binary Ionization Technology which is designed to be easily incorporated into any industry’s current cleaning procedures. No wipe, no rinse, no residue, non-corrosive, high level efficacy, quick turnaround time, superior material compatibility (spray direct on sensitive equipment), and a submicron particle allows the mist/fog to reach every area being treated regardless of what is in the space.

 SteraMist® is being used throughout the world and has been demonstrated to reduce certain resistant problem organisms, such as bacterial spores, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), Clostridium difficile, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”), Ebola (“Ebola”) and SARS CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID. In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist® is being used for terminal cleaning, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of Clostridium difficile spore rates. SteraMist® has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO’s (Klebsiella pneumoniae, AB, pseudomonas aeruginosa) at large hospital to small clinics and has contributed to the control of MERS, Ebola and COVID throughout the world.

 Although our technology was developed to combat the hardest to kill pathogens and neutralize the most difficult chemical agents, our products and services have been used by our customers who are fighting at the front lines of combating the COVID-19 pandemic, especially from early 2020 to 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic gradually subsides, our customers continued to utilize our products as cleaning protocols have been changed due the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Our technology passed a sanctioned test showing six-log reduction against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is the laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. BIT™ has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents, including weaponized anthrax, chemical agents such as VX (an extremely toxic organophosphate) and sulfur mustard (otherwise known as mustard gas) when applied using properly developed international protocols.

Industries & Market Segments

Our product offerings help our customers create a healthier world by providing them a significant opportunity to help reduce the spread of Community Associated Infections (“CAI’s”) and Healthcare-Acquired Infections (“HAI’s”) and the most lethal of pathogens including our recent SARS CoV-2 pandemic and future pandemics.

SteraMist® and TOMI’s related service platforms are currently being used in a broad spectrum of industries and have the ability to fit into any cleaning protocol. We have categorized these industries into five (5) divisions: Hospital-HealthCare, Life Sciences, TOMI Service Network (TSN), Food Safety, and Commercial.

Hospital-HealthCare. SteraMist® solutions aid our Hospital-HealthCare customers in providing the quality of care and safety they provide to their patients by disinfecting patient and operating rooms, pharmacies, ambulances, and emergency environments in a hospital or healthcare facility. Our team of technicians and representatives train, write treatment protocols, maintain and troubleshoot capital equipment throughout the world for our Hospital-HealthCare customers.

We continue to penetrate the hospital-healthcare market segment, and under the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, hospitals that have high rates of infections and HAIs are facing significant financial penalties. Our SteraMist® BIT™ technology has proven to reduce the transference spread of infections leading to an overall reduction in the number of patients being infected as a result of the historic poor manual cleaning of these patient rooms, infectious disease rooms and operatory suites, with a corresponding return on investment to the hospital of up to 20-to-1 in the first year.

Life Sciences. Our SteraMist® line of products is a decontamination solution in this industry, specifically pharmaceutical (compounding and manufacturing), vivariums, research universities, BSLs (biological safety labs) 1, 2, 3 and 4 level, BSC’s (biological safety chambers), isolators, cage washers, and cleanrooms. With proper implementation of SteraMist®, all facilities can reduce the risk of infectious as well as potentially infectious agents and/or materials, which facilities such as these handle on a routine basis.

There are many requirements and restrictions on the type of decontamination agents our Life Sciences customers may use to prevent these risks and remediate adverse incidents. In light of these regulations, our rapid deployment of our effective iHP™ aerosolized mist is the solution to lower risks, reduce damage to expensive laboratory equipment and furniture, eliminate other labor intense procedures, and perform decontamination clean-up in these spaces quickly, less caustically, requiring no wipe and with no residue. By using iHP technology these most important facilities are able to perform more experiments a year due to the effective quick treatment that iHP offers.

Our team of technicians and representatives train, maintain, and troubleshoot capital equipment globally for our Life Sciences customers. Further, our iHP™ Corporate Service decontamination team provides routine and emergency treatment. TOMI’s iHP™ service team performs commissioning and decommissioning of facilities equipment or full complete space decontamination for new and existing customers.

The TOMI Service Network. The TSN, has allowed us to enhance our corporate service division by creating a multi-nation-wide network composed of existing, full-service specialists. 

These professional servicing specialists (TSN partners) focus their businesses in the commercial and residential space. Our team of customer experience managers and our training department maintains and troubleshoots capital equipment for these individuals with the goal of implementing servicing procedures and protocols throughout the United States and Canada for our TSN partners. Members are provided access to 24/7 support in marketing their iHP service divisions and landing webpage connected to our website.

We are technically advancing and streamlining engagement for the TOMI Service Network (TSN) by providing a user-friendly membership portal – The SteraMist | TSN Portal. This membership portal will host all marketing and informational material, ability to share member information to easily collaborate with other members, forums to interact and discuss topics and further develop knowledge on disinfection, podcast link, news alerts about new products and promotions, and direct to an order link. This portal will be available for desktop as well as a mobile app located on Apple App Store and Google Play. This portal will also be available for SteraMist Representatives, domestic and international, with amended permissions for ease of access to all SteraMist sales materials.

Our TSN network includes professional first responders that specialize within the mold remediation, hurricane and tornado response and other mitigation fields, biohazard and forensic specialists, and janitorial businesses. 

Food Safety Industry. SteraMist® aerosolizing cold plasma technology is an effective decontaminant in the food safety industry. According to the CDC, 80 million people per year in the United States contract, and 5,000 people die from, food poisoning or other food-related illnesses. Current food safety cleaning techniques involve time intensive processes, which can reduce food manufacturers’ profit. Our iHP™ degrades into only harmless water (humidity) and oxygen. We have applied for approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), when approved we anticipate that our solution can be applied directly to all foods. Currently we use SteraMist® on food packing, processing and storage equipment as SteraMist® is safe for use on electronics and kitchenware, along with high touch surfaces where most pathogens are found (such as phones, computers and kitchen appliances). We believe that SteraMist® could be useful for decontamination at all phases of food production, from the farm, slaughterhouse, packaging and canning facilities, food storage locations to the transportation of food and to the restaurants and grocery stores.

Commercial. TOMI commercial division addresses the viral pathogens threat to everyday operations. We bring powerful disinfection and decontamination to a wide array of industries with computability in endless use sites, from large-scale land, sea, and air transportation to county and state emergency facilities to retail and educational facilities. Our commercial customers have the goal to keep employees and first responders healthy while maintaining operations and our latest product launch the SteraPak® has received well recognized feedback in these markets.

Competition

The decontamination and environmental infectious disease control industry is intensely competitive and highly regulated. Competition is intense in all five (5) of our divisions and includes many large and small competitors.

Our competitors include companies that market other hydrogen peroxide-based products, such as Steris Corporation (“Steris”), Bioquell, Inc. (“Bioquell”) currently owned by Ecolab, Inc. (“Ecolab”) and The Clorox Company (“Clorox”), various ultraviolet companies and quad ammonia-chemical companies. During 2021 due to the COVID outbreak, new competitors that manufacture and sell electrostatic sprayers and biostatic protectants, specifically to the commercial industry, entered the market.

We believe our SteraMist® suite of products have a competitive advantage to our competitor’s products in that they are quicker and less caustic, provides a six log kill to a wide variety of pathogens and leave no residue or unpleasant odor. However, some of these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us.

We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the service, and our abilities to discover, develop, market, and innovate, disruptive cost-effective products and services. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar facilities. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon our ability to market and sell our indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Competitive Advantages

 We believe the SteraMist® technology has many advantages over its competition. Our technology can turn over a space to an end-user far faster than its competition. Our technology requires limited preparation to an area compared to our competitors and does not rely on fans or any outside force to move throughout a space. Our “iHP OH” is the smallest submicron 0.3-3-micron particle that receives a charge and can move around an area like a gas, going above, below, and beyond the hardest to reach areas.

10


Another key and critical advantage is the technology’s superior material compatibility. iHP kills on contact and leaves no dangerous byproducts in the areas being treated. It is important the world is educated and aware of the harsh chemicals that exist on the market, and used with electrostatic sprayers, as they will not ensure proper efficacy on the surface being treated as even if the chemical is EPA registered, it may not be compatible with the sprayer. For example, the sprayer may not be spraying enough of the chemical to kill the virus or the bacteria, in addition to a lot of these harsh chemicals and sprayers are destroying materials and equipment over time, creating a more costly product in the long run.

Our patented SteraMist technology can treat almost 4,000 cubic feet in 45 minutes with a contact time of only 15 minutes or spray surfaces 5 seconds per square foot with no wet contact time. Our technology has multiple competitive advantages required for disinfection SteraMist is no wipe, no rinse, no residue, non-corrosive, high level efficacy (developed by DARPA for Anthrax spores), quick turnaround time, superior material compatibility (spray direct on sensitive equipment), and our submicron-small micron particles which moves like a gas allows the mist/fog to reach every area being treated regardless of what is in the space.

 In summary, SteraMist® offers the following competitive advantages:


· | Provides a 99.9999% or six-log kill and above kill (i.e., the statistical destruction of all microorganisms and their spores) on all challenged pathogens, on multiple surfaces including Bacillus atrophaeus spores, Bacillus subtilis spores and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, the spore that is considered a gold standard for validation of sterilization versus household/industrial cleaners that offer a 99.9% (sanitizing) or three-log kill to 99.99% (disinfection) or four-log kill.

Government Regulation

 Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the EPA, the FDA and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Government regulations include detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices. We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. To date, every registration for our technology we have applied for has been accepted.
Employees

 As of March 14, 2022, we have twenty-four (24) full-time executive, operational and administrative employees working within the United States. Most of our sales are conducted by global exclusive distribution agreements or domestically by our internal sales team or independent manufacturing representatives. We consider our relationship with the employees to be good.
