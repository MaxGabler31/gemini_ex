SUPPLY CHAIN
 
The parts and raw materials for the Company’s products are generally available from more than one source. Except for certain optoelectronic products, the Company does not manufacture the basic parts or materials used in production of its products. From time to time, the Company has experienced difficulty in obtaining certain materials when needed. The Company’s inability to secure materials for any reason could have adverse effects on the Company’s ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could result in loss of customers or sales. However, the Company has not been materially affected by such shortages. The Company uses capacitors, active semiconductor devices (primarily in chip form), hermetic packages, ceramic substrates, resistor inks, conductor pastes, precious metals and other materials in its manufacturing operations. The Company’s delivery commitments to customers allow for adequate lead times for production of the products including lead time for order and receipt from the supply chain.
 
Some of the Company’s primary suppliers are NTK Technologies, W. L Gore, Hughes Circuits, Semi-Dice and TTI.
