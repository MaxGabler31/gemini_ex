Item 1.    Business
Overview
j2 Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“j2 Global”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a leading provider of internet services. Through our Cloud Services segment, we provide cloud services to consumers and businesses and license our intellectual property (“IP”) to third parties. In addition, the Cloud Services segment includes fax, voice, backup, security and email marketing products. Our Digital Media segment specializes in the technology, gaming, lifestyle and healthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. 
Our Cloud Services segment generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees and from IP licensing fees. Our Digital Media segment generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees.
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets. 
Our consolidated revenues are currently generated from three basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability. Our Cloud Services segment is driven primarily by subscription revenues that are relatively higher margin, stable and predictable from quarter to quarter with some seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter. The Cloud Services segment also includes the results of our IP licensing business, which can vary dramatically in both revenues and profitability from period to period. Our Digital Media segment is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. We continue to pursue additional acquisitions, which may include companies operating under business models that differ from those we operate under today. Such acquisitions could impact our consolidated profit margins and the variability of our revenues.
We were incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a new holding company structure, and our Cloud Services segment, operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, j2 Cloud Services, LLC (formerly j2 Cloud Services, Inc.), and its subsidiaries, was founded in 1995. We manage our operations through two business segments: Cloud Services and Digital Media. Information regarding revenue and operating income attributable to each of our reportable segments and certain geographic information is included within Note 16 - Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
Cloud Services
We believe that businesses of all sizes are increasingly purchasing cloud services to meet their communication, messaging, security, data backup, hosting, customer relationship management and other needs. Cloud-based services represent a model for delivering and consuming, independent of location, real time business technology services, resources and solutions over the internet. Their goal is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security. Our eFax®, MyFax® and sFax® online fax services enable users to receive faxes into their email inboxes and to send faxes via the internet. eVoice® and Onebox® provide our customers a virtual phone system with various available enhancements. KeepItSafe®, LiveVault®, and Livedrive® enable our customers to securely back up their data and dispose of tape or other physical systems. Our FuseMail® service provides our customers email, encryption, archival and perimeter protection solutions, while Campaigner® provides our customers enhanced email marketing solutions. All of these services represent software-as-a-service solutions except online backup which represents both a software-as-a-service solution and an infrastructure-as-a-service solution. We believe these services represent more efficient and less expensive solutions than many existing alternatives, and provide increased security, privacy, flexibility and mobility.
We generate substantially all of our Cloud Services revenues from “fixed” subscription revenues for basic customer subscriptions and, to a lesser extent, “variable” usage revenues generated from actual usage by our subscribers. Our online fax, virtual phone, email, customer relationship management and online backup products have both a fixed and variable subscription component with the substantial majority of revenues derived from the fixed portion. In addition, the cost structures of all our Cloud Services are very similar in terms of fixed and variable components and include capital expenditures that are in proportion to revenue for each product offering. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from patent licensing. We categorize our Cloud Services and solutions into two basic groups: number-based, which are services provided in whole or in part through a telephone number, and non-number-based, which are our other cloud services for business.
We market our Cloud Services offerings to a broad spectrum of prospective business customers including sole proprietors, small to medium-sized businesses, enterprises and government organizations. Our marketing efforts include enhancing brand

awareness; utilizing online advertising, search engines and affiliate programs; selling through both a telesales and direct sales force; and cross-selling. We continuously seek to extend the number of distribution channels through which we acquire paying customers and improve the cost and volume of customers obtained through our current channels.
We offer the following cloud services and solutions:
Fax
eFax® is the leading brand in the global online fax market. Various tiers of service provide increasing levels of features and functionality to sole proprietors, small and medium-sized businesses, and enterprises around the world. Our most popular services allow individuals to receive and send faxes as email attachments. In addition to eFax®, we offer online fax services under a variety of alternative brands including sFax®, MyFax®, eFax Plus®, eFax Pro™, eFax Secure™, eFax Corporate™ and eFax Developer™.
Voice
eVoice® is a virtual phone system that provides small and medium-sized businesses on-demand voice communications services, featuring a toll-free or local company number, auto-attendant and menu tree. With these services, a subscriber can assign departmental and individual extensions that can connect to multiple U.S. or Canadian numbers, including land-line and mobile phones and IP networks, and can enhance reachability through “find me/follow me” capabilities. These services also include advanced integrated voicemail for each extension, effectively unifying mobile, office and other separate voicemail services and improving efficiency by delivering voicemails in both native audio format and as transcribed text.

These solutions are hosted offsite and seamlessly integrated into a customer’s existing email system.

We have a team of experts that help our customers’ setup and optimize the SMTP relay.
IP Licensing
We hold a number of issued U.S. and foreign patents and other intellectual property rights. We seek to license some of these intellectual property rights to third parties in exchange for fees. We include the results of these activities within the Cloud Services segment, exclusive of brand licensing by the Digital Media segment. 
Global Network and Operations 
Our Cloud Services business operates multiple physical Points of Presence (“POPs”) worldwide, a central data center in Los Angeles and a remote disaster recovery facility. We connect our POPs to our central data centers via redundant, and often times diverse, Virtual Private Networks (“VPNs”) using the internet. Our network is designed to deliver value-added user applications, customer support and billing services for our customers anywhere in the world and a local presence for customers from thousands of cities in 50 countries on six continents. We offer our services in all major metropolitan areas in the United States (“U.S.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Canada and such major cities as Berlin, Copenhagen, Madrid, Manila, Mexico City, Milan, Paris, Rome, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo, Vienna and Zurich. Our customers are located throughout the world. 
Customer Support Services
Our Cloud Services customer service organization supports our cloud services customers through a combination of online self-help, email communications, interactive chat sessions and telephone calls. Our internet-based online self-help tools enable customers to resolve simple issues on their own, eliminating the need to speak or write to our customer service representatives. We use internal personnel and contracted third parties (on a dedicated personnel basis) to answer our customer emails and telephone calls and to participate in interactive chat sessions.
Our Cloud Services customer service organization provides email support seven days per week, 24 hours per day, to all subscribers. Paying subscribers have access to live-operator telephone support seven days per week, 24 hours per day. Dedicated telephone support is provided for corporate customers 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Live sales and customer support services are available in various languages, including English, Spanish, Dutch, German, French, Japanese and Cantonese.
Competition
Our Cloud Services segment faces competition from, among others, online fax-providers, traditional fax machine or multi-function printer companies, unified messaging/communications providers, telephone companies, voicemail providers, companies offering PBX systems and outsourced PBX solutions, email providers, various data backup and hosting providers and customer relationship management solutions. Historically, our most popular solutions have related to online faxing, including the ability of our customers to access faxes via email and our outbound desktop faxing capabilities. These solutions compete primarily against traditional fax machine manufacturers, which are generally large and well-established companies, as well as publicly traded and privately-held providers of fax servers and related software and outsourced fax services. Some of these companies may have greater financial and other resources than we do. 
We believe that the primary competitive factors determining our success in the market for our Cloud Services include financial strength and stability; pricing; reputation for reliability and security of service; intellectual property ownership; effectiveness of customer support; sign-up, service and software ease-of-use; service scalability; customer messaging and branding; geographic coverage; scope of services; currency and payment method acceptance; and local language sales, messaging and support. 
For more information regarding the competition that we face, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We generate Digital Media revenues from the sale of display and video advertising on our owned-and-operated properties as well as third-party sites; from the sale of customer clicks to online merchants as well as commissions on sales attributed to clicks to online merchants; from business-to-business leads to IT vendors; from the licensing of technology, data and other intellectual material to clients; and from the sale of subscription services to consumers and businesses.

We believe competitive factors relating to attracting and retaining users include the ability to provide premium and exclusive content and the reach, effectiveness, and efficiency of our marketing services to attract consumers, advertisers, healthcare professionals and publishers. We continue to seek opportunities to acquire additional web properties, both within and outside of the technology, gaming, lifestyle and healthcare verticals, with the goal of monetizing their audiences and content though application of our proprietary technologies and insight.

For more information regarding the competition that we face, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We regard the protection of our intellectual property rights as important to our success. We aggressively protect these rights by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress and trade secrets. We also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
Through a combination of internal technology development and acquisitions, we have built a portfolio of numerous U.S. and foreign patents. We generate licensing revenues from some of these patents. We are currently engaged in litigation to enforce several of our patents. For a more detailed description of the lawsuits in which we are involved, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We intend to continue to invest in patents, to aggressively protect our patent assets from unauthorized use and to generate patent licensing revenues from authorized users.
Several of our U.S. patents have been reaffirmed through reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). We have generated royalties from licensing certain of our patents and have enforced certain patents against companies using our patented technology without our permission.
We seek patents for inventions that may contribute to our business or technology sector. In addition, we have multiple pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, covering components of our technology and in some cases technologies beyond those that we currently offer. Unless and until patents are issued on the pending applications, no patent rights can be enforced. 
We have obtained patent licenses for certain technologies where such licenses are necessary or advantageous.

Like other technology-based businesses, we face the risk that we will be unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and the risk that we will be found to have infringed the proprietary rights of others. For more information regarding these risks, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business over the internet and, in some cases, using services of third-party telecommunications and internet service providers. These include, among others, laws and regulations addressing privacy, data storage, retention and security, freedom of expression, content, taxation, numbers, advertising and intellectual property. We are not a regulated telecommunications provider in the U.S. For information about the risks we face with respect to governmental regulation, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.
Seasonality
Our Cloud Services revenues are impacted by the number of effective business days in a given period. We traditionally experience lower than average Cloud Services usage and customer sign-ups in the fourth quarter. Revenues associated with our Digital Media operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, becoming most active during the fourth quarter holiday period due to increased retail activity.
Research and Development
The markets for our services are evolving rapidly, requiring ongoing expenditures for research and development and timely introduction of new services and service enhancements. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our current services, to respond effectively to technological changes, attract and retain engineering talent, sell additional services to our existing customer base and introduce new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
We devote significant resources to develop new services and service enhancements. Our research, development and engineering expenditures were $46.0 million, $38.0 million and $34.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For more information regarding the technological risks that we face, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,487 employees, the majority of whom are in the U.S.
Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing and management personnel. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit or agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
