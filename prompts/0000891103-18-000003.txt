OVERVIEW
Who We Are
IAC is a leading media and Internet company composed of widely known consumer brands, such as Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid, which are part of Match Group’s online dating portfolio, and HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List, which are operated by ANGI Homeservices, as well as Vimeo, Dotdash, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast and Investopedia.
For information regarding the results of operations of IAC’s segments, as well as their respective contributions to IAC’s consolidated results of operations, see “Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
All references to “IAC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
Our History
IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc. After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies. In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005.
In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire).
In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. and completed the separation of its travel and travel‑related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. In 2008, IAC separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster (now part of Live Nation, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc.
In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic, a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a €5 million note. In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation’s equity stake in IAC.
In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%. In 2012, we acquired About.com (now known as Dotdash).
In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick’s “owned and operated” website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, and The Princeton Review.
In 2015, we acquired Plentyoffish Media Inc., a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, for $575 million in cash, and completed the initial public offering of Match Group, Inc.
In 2016, we acquired VHX, a platform for premium over-the-top (OTT) subscription video channels, as well as a controlling interest in MyHammer Holding AG, the leading home services marketplace in Germany, and sold PriceRunner, ASKfm and ShoeBuy.
In 2017, we acquired controlling interests in HomeStars Inc. and MyBuilder Limited, leading home services platforms in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively, as well as sold The Princeton Review. We also completed the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor segment with those of Angie’s List, Inc. under a new publicly traded holding company that we control, ANGI Homeservices Inc. Lastly, through our Vimeo subsidiary, we acquired Livestream Inc., a leading live video solution.

DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES
Match Group
Overview
Our Match Group segment consists of the businesses and operations of Match Group, Inc. (“Match Group”). Through Match Group, we operate a dating business that consists of a portfolio of brands, available in 42 languages across more than 190 countries. As of December 31, 2017, IAC’s ownership and voting interests in Match Group were 81.2% and 97.6%, respectively.
Services
Through the brands within our dating business, we are a leading provider of subscription dating products servicing North America, Western Europe, Asia and many other regions around the world through websites and applications that we own and operate.
All of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review the profiles of other users without charge. Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free and some of which are paid, depending on the particular product. In general, access to premium features requires a subscription, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance. Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of subscription purchased, the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers. In addition to subscriptions, many of our dating products offer users certain features, such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other users, and these features are offered on a pay‑per‑use (or à la carte) basis. The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand‑by‑brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
Revenue
Match Group revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscriptions. Revenue is also earned from online advertising, the purchase of à la carte features (where users pay a non-recurring fee for a specific action or event) and offline events.
Marketing
We attract the majority of users of our dating products through word-of-mouth and other free channels. In addition, many of our brands rely on paid user acquisition efforts for a significant percentage of their users. Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising, banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns, video advertising, business development or partnership deals and hiring influencers to promote our dating products. Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events.
Competition
The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally. We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products. In addition to other online dating brands, we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services, such as in‑person matchmakers. Arguably, our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | our ability to continue to increase consumer acceptance and adoption of online dating products, including in emerging markets and other parts of the world where the stigma is only beginning to erode;


• | continued growth in Internet access and smart phone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets;


• | the continued strength of Match Group’s brands;


• | the breadth and depth of Match Group’s active user communities relative to those of its competitors;


• | our ability to evolve our dating products in response to competitor offerings, user requirements, social trends and the technological landscape;


• | our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our dating products;


• | our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies; and

4


• | the design and functionality of our dating products.

Lastly, we believe our broad portfolio of dating brands is a competitive advantage, given that a large portion of online dating customers use multiple dating products over a given period of time, either concurrently or sequentially.
ANGI Homeservices
Overview
Our ANGI Homeservices segment consists of the North America (United States and Canada) and European businesses and operations of ANGI Homeservices Inc. (“ANGI Homeservices”). ANGI Homeservices is a new publicly traded holding company that was formed to facilitate the combination of the businesses within our former HomeAdvisor segment with Angie’s List, Inc. ("Angie's List"), which transaction was completed on September 29, 2017 (the “Combination”).
Following the completion of the Combination, we own and operate the HomeAdvisor business, which includes the Marketplace (described below) in the United States and the various entities operating its international businesses, plus Angie's List, mHelpDesk, CraftJack and Felix.
ANGI Homeservices is the world’s largest digital marketplace for home services, connecting millions of homeowners across the globe with home service professionals. ANGI Homeservices operates leading brands in eight countries, including HomeAdvisor® and Angie's List® (United States), HomeStars (Canada), Travaux.com (France), MyHammer (Germany and Austria), MyBuilder (UK), Werkspot (Netherlands) and Instapro (Italy).
As of December 31, 2017, IAC’s economic and voting interests in ANGI Homeservices were 86.9% and 98.5%, respectively.
Services
Overview. We own and operate the HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service in the United States (formerly known as our HomeAdvisor domestic business, the “Marketplace”), which matches consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. The Marketplace provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments with those professionals online. The Marketplace also matches consumers with service professionals instantly by telephone, as well as offers several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects. We provide all Marketplace services and tools to consumers free of charge.
As of December 31, 2017, the Marketplace had a network of approximately 181,000 service professionals, each of whom had an active network membership and/or paid for consumer matches in December 2017. These service professionals provided services in more than 500 categories and 400 discrete markets in the United States, ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling projects. The Marketplace generated approximately 18.1 million fully completed and submitted customer service requests during the year ended December 31, 2017.
We also own and operate Angie’s List, which connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories nationwide. Angie’s List also provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content, including more than ten million verified reviews of local service professionals, to help them research, shop and hire for local services. We provide consumers with access to the Angie's List nationwide directory and related basic tools and services free of charge.
Marketplace Consumer Services. Consumers can submit a service request for a service professional through HomeAdvisor platforms (website and mobile application), as well as through certain paths on the Angie’s List website and various third-party affiliate platforms. When a consumer submits a request for a service professional, we generally match that consumer (through our proprietary algorithms) with up to four service professionals from our network based on several factors, including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request. When a consumer submits a service request through an Angie’s List platform, we generally match that consumer (through our proprietary algorithms) with a combination of Marketplace service professionals and selected certified service professionals (described below) from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory (as and if available for the given service request). 
5

Service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched through the Marketplace directly and consumers can review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. In all cases, consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through the Marketplace (including any from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory).
We also provide several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through our Instant Booking offering, consumers can schedule appointments for select home services with a Marketplace service professional instantly across HomeAdvisor platforms (website or mobile application). Through our Instant Connect offering, consumers can connect with a Marketplace service professional instantly by phone, as well as access the service through digital voice assistant platforms. In certain markets, we also provide Same Say Service and Next Day Service for certain home services.
In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access the online HomeAdvisor True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as an online library of home services-related resources, which consists primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with service professionals.
Marketplace Service Professional Services. We primarily offer and sell Marketplace memberships and related products and services to service professionals through our sales force (described below). Our basic annual membership package includes membership in our network of service professionals, as well as access to consumer connections through the Marketplace and a listing in the HomeAdvisor online directory and certain other affiliate directories, among other benefits. In addition to the membership subscription fee, Marketplace service professionals pay fees for consumer matches. We also offer certain other subscription products to Marketplace service professionals through mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud based field service software for small to mid-size service professionals, as well as custom website development and hosting services. 
Angie's List Consumer Services. When consumers visit an Angie’s List platform (website or mobile application), they can choose to register in order to search for a service professional in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory or be matched with a service professional through the Marketplace.
We provide consumers who register with access to ratings and reviews and the ability to search for service professionals through the Angie’s List nationwide online directory, as well as the Angie’s List digital magazine and access to certain promotions. For a fee, we offer two premium membership packages, which include varying degrees of online and phone support, access to exclusive promotions and features and the award-winning Angie’s List print magazine. Consumers who choose the Marketplace option will be matched with a combination of Marketplace service professionals and selected certified service professionals (described below) from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory (as and if available for the given service request). 
Angie's List Service Professional Services. We provide service professionals with a variety of services and tools through Angie’s List. Generally, service professionals who do not have an overall member grade below a “B” are eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member grade, passing certain criminal background checks and attesting to proper licensure requirements.
Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must purchase term-based advertising from us to obtain certification. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 45,000 certified service professionals under contract for advertising. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the term of his or her contract, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any of our service channels, we suspend any existing advertising and exclusive promotions and the related advertising contract is subject to termination.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in directory search results for an applicable category (together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information), with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose the Marketplace option, our proprietary algorithms will determine where a given service professional appears within search results.

Revenue
Our revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which are fees paid by Marketplace service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service), and membership subscription fees paid by service professionals. Fees paid by Marketplace service professionals for consumer matches vary based upon several factors, including the service requested, type of match (such as Instant Booking, Instant Connect, Same Day Service or Next Day Service) and geographic location of service. Our consumer connection revenue is generated and recognized when a consumer match is delivered to a Marketplace service professional. Membership subscription revenue is generated through subscription sales to Marketplace service professionals and is deferred and recognized over the term (primarily one year) of the applicable membership.
Revenue is also derived from the sale of time-based advertising to certified service professionals listed in the Angie’s List nationwide directory and membership subscription fees from consumers for premium membership packages. Service professionals generally pay for advertisements in advance on a monthly or annual basis, at their option, with the average advertising contract term being approximately one year. Advertising contracts generally include an early termination penalty. Revenue from the sale of website, mobile and call center advertising is recognized ratably over the time period in which the advertisements run. Revenue from the sale of advertising in the Angie’s List Magazine is recognized in the period in which the publication, containing the advertisement is published and distributed. Angie's List prepaid membership subscription fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the associated subscription, which is typically one year.
Marketing
We market our various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid search engine marketing, display advertising and third party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through email. Pursuant to third party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Marketplace products and services and those of Marketplace service professionals on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, we agree to pay these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through to one of our platforms and submit a valid service request through the Marketplace, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to the Marketplace. We also market our products and services to consumers through partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through relationships with certain retailers and direct mail.
We market subscription packages and related products and services to service professionals primarily through our Golden, Colorado based sales force, as well as through sales forces in Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado, Lenexa, Kansas, New York, New York and Indianapolis, Indiana. We also market these products and services through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We market term-based advertising and related products to service professionals primarily through our Indianapolis based sales force.
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. We compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related lead generation platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe our biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which is by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the size, quality, diversity and stability of our network of Marketplace service professionals and the breadth of our online directory listings;


• | the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;

7


• | our ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, our various brands, particularly our Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor brands;


• | our ability to consistently generate service requests through the Marketplace and leads through our online directories that convert into revenue for our service professionals in a cost-effective manner; and


• | the quality and consistency of our service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.

Video
Overview
Our Video segment consists primarily of Vimeo, Electus, IAC Films and Daily Burn.
Vimeo
Services. Vimeo operates a global video sharing platform for creators and their audiences. Through Vimeo, we provide creators with professional tools to host, manage, review, distribute and monetize videos online, as well as provide audiences with a high quality, ad-free viewing experience across devices.
We offer basic video hosting and sharing services free of charge. For certain fees, we offer premium capabilities for creators, including: additional video storage space, advanced video privacy controls, video player customization options, team collaboration and management, review and workflow tools, lead generation, premium support and the ability to sell videos (on a subscription or transactional basis) directly to consumers in a customized viewing experience. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 873,000 subscribers to Vimeo's SaaS video tools, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Vimeo reached over 260 million unique users worldwide. 
We also provide creators with professional live streaming capabilities directly through Vimeo, as well as through Livestream, a leading live video solution that we acquired in October 2017. Through Livestream, we also provide creators with production hardware, tools and services for capturing, broadcasting and editing live events, including: (i) our Mevo® camera, a pocket-sized live event camera that allows creators to edit video live as their events unfold, as well as stream their events live to multiple destinations, including other live streaming and social media platforms, (ii) live editing software for desktop, laptops and certain other devices that provides creators with live production control room-like features and (iii) professional services to assist creators with the planning, set up, production and management of live events.
Marketing. We market Vimeo’s services primarily through online marketing efforts, including search engine marketing, social media, e-mail campaigns, display advertising and affiliate marketing, as well as through our owned and operated website and mobile applications.
Revenue. Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly subscription fees paid by creators for premium capabilities and, to a lesser extent, sales of live streaming hardware, software and professional services.
Competition. Vimeo competes with a variety of online video providers, from general purpose video sharing sites for consumers and creators to niche workflow and distribution solutions for professionals and enterprises. We believe that Vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by offering a customizable, high definition video player, proprietary uploading and encoding infrastructure, a high quality, ad-free viewing experience and a turnkey solution for the production, distribution and monetization of video content.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily on:

• | the quality of our technology platform, premium offerings, live streaming tools and services and user (creator and viewer) experience;


• | whether our premium offerings and live streaming tools and services resonate with creators;


• | the ability of creators to distribute Vimeo-hosted content across third party platforms and the prominence and visibility of such content within search engine results and social media platforms;


• | the recognition and strength of the Vimeo brand relative to those of our competitors; and


• | our ability to drive new subscribers to our platform through various forms of direct marketing.

Electus
Services. Through Electus, we provide production and producer services for both unscripted and scripted television and digital content, primarily for initial sale and distribution in the United States. Our content is distributed on a wide range of 
8

platforms, including broadcast television, premium and basic cable television, subscription-based and ad-supported video-on-demand services and other outlets. We also sell and distribute Electus programming and other content, together with programming and other content developed by third parties, outside of the United States through Electus International, as well as work with various brands to integrate their products into, as well as sponsor, Electus content through our Content Marketing team.
In addition, we operate Electus Digital, which consists of the following websites and properties: CollegeHumor.com, Dorkly.com and Drawfee.com; YouTube channels WatchLOUD, Nuevon and Hungry; and Big Breakfast (a production company).

Through Electus, we also operate Notional.
Revenue. Electus revenue is derived primarily from media production and distribution and display advertising.
Marketing. We do not engage in any formal marketing efforts in the case of our production and producer services, instead relying on referrals and the quality of our services and projects. For content distribution, we rely on our sales force, referrals and the quality of our services and projects, and for international distribution only, attendance at industry trade shows. In addition, the platforms to which we license our content for distribution market our content through their own independent marketing efforts. Electus Digital attracts users and audience primarily through social media, search engine marketing and affiliate agreements.
Competition. We compete with entertainment studios, production companies, distribution companies, creative agencies and content websites. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the quality and diversity of our content relative to that of our competitors and the third parties to whom we license our content, as well as the quality of the services provided by licensees of our content;


• | our continued ability to create new content that resonates with licensees and viewers; and


• | our ability to sell integration and sponsorship opportunities for our content.

IAC Films
Services. IAC Films provides production and producer services for feature films (primarily for initial sale and distribution in the United States and internationally). Our content is distributed through theatrical releases and video-on-demand services.
Revenue. IAC Films revenue is derived primarily from media production and distribution.
Marketing. We pay third parties to market our films to consumers through traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), trailers in theaters and digital marketing (primarily paid marketing through search engine and social media platforms), and to a lesser extent through viral marketing and paid advertisement in print media. 
Competition. We compete with major studios, independent motion picture companies, distribution companies and digital media platforms. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the quality and diversity of our films relative to those of our competitors;


• | our continued ability to retain the services of quality actors, directors, producers and other creative and technical personnel, as well as production financing; and


• | our continued ability to create new films that resonate with viewers and distribute them to a broad viewing audience through theaters and video-on-demand channels.

Competition. The fitness and workout market is highly competitive and barriers to entry, particularly in the case of online platforms, are minimal. We compete primarily with other streaming fitness and workout platforms and, to a lesser extent, fitness and workout DVDs.

Applications    
Overview
Our Applications segment consists of:

• | Consumer, which develops and distributes downloadable desktop and mobile applications and includes Apalon, which houses our mobile applications, and SlimWare; and


• | Partnerships, which includes our business-to-business partnership operations.

Consumer
Through our Consumer business, we develop, market and distribute a variety of applications, primarily browser extensions, which consist of a browser tab page and related technology that together enable users to run search queries directly from their new tab page and web browsers. Many of our browser extensions are coupled with other applications that we have developed that provide users with access to various forms of content and software capabilities. These applications include: FromDoctoPDF, through which users can convert documents from one format into various others and share them across multiple platforms; MapsGalaxy, through which users can access accurate street maps, local traffic conditions and aerial and satellite street views; and WeatherBlink, through which users can access local weather conditions and satellite radar maps directly from their web browsers. Other applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as recipes, entertainment and astrology, among others) or provide users with particular reference information or access to specific capabilities (such as internet speed, online forms and package tracking, among others). We distribute these applications directly to consumers free of charge.
The Consumer business also includes: (i) Apalon, a mobile development company with one of the largest and most popular portfolios of mobile applications worldwide and (ii) SlimWare, a provider of community-powered software and services that clean, repair, update, secure and optimize computers, mobile phones and digital devices.
Partnerships
Through our Partnerships business, we work closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser-based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners’ products and services.
Revenue
Substantially all of the Applications segment's revenue consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites. Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers. The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Applications businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") in the manner provided by and pursuant to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020. The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Applications businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Applications businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us. We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click. In cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs. See “Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
To a significantly lesser extent, the Applications segment's revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications and services, fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements.
Competition
We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to develop, market and distribute applications and related technology directly and through third parties. Competitors of our Applications businesses include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other third party browser extension, convenience search and desktop and mobile applications providers, as well as other search technology and convenience service providers.
10

Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Applications businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
We believe that the ability of our Applications businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to:

• | create browser extensions and other applications that resonate with consumers (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search services);


• | maintain industry-leading monetization solutions for our applications;


• | differentiate our browser extensions and other applications from those of our competitors (primarily through providing customized browser tab pages and access to multiple search and other services through our browser extensions);


• | secure cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties; and


• | market and distribute our browser extensions and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner.

Publishing
Overview
Our Publishing segment consists of:

• | our Premium Brands business, which includes Dotdash (formerly About.com), Dictionary.com, Investopedia and The Daily Beast; and

Our Publishing businesses publish digital content and/or provide search services to users. Those of our Publishing businesses that publish digital content (our Premium Brands) generate such content through various sources, including, for example, through a combination of internal and independent freelance subject matter "experts" in the case of Dotdash and internal editorial staff in the case of The Daily Beast, and/or acquire such content (or the rights to publish such content) from third parties. Those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services generally generate and display of a set of algorithmic search results, or hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users. In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries. The paid listings displayed by our Publishing businesses are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.

Revenue
The Publishing segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, display advertisements (sold directly and through programmatic ad sales) and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications. The substantial majority of the paid listings that our Publishing businesses display are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.
Competition
We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers to our Publishing businesses.
In terms of publishing digital content, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results in relevant vertical categories and social channels. In terms of providing search services, generally our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search-centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications).
Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Publishing businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
We believe that the ability of our Publishing businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon:

• | the quality of the content and features on our various Publishing platforms (websites and mobile applications), and the attractiveness of the services provided by these platforms generally, relative to those of our competitors;


• | our ability to successfully generate and acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner;


• | the relevance and authority of the content and search results featured on our various Publishing platforms; and


• | our ability to successfully market the content and search services offered by our Publishing businesses in a cost-effective manner.

Other
Our Other segment consisted of The Princeton Review, which provided a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services, ShoeBuy, an Internet retailer of footwear and related apparel and accessories, and PriceRunner, a shopping comparison website. The Princeton Review, ShoeBuy and PriceRunner were sold in March 2017, December 2016 and March 2016, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, IAC and its subsidiaries employed approximately 7,000 employees. We believe that we generally have good relationships with our employees.
