 Segments
 As of May 31, 2018, we, together with our unconsolidated affiliates, operated 85 manufacturing facilities in 25 states and 11 countries.  Thirty-six of these facilities are operated by wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the Company.  The remaining facilities are operated by our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  
 
Our operations are managed principally on a products and services basis and are comprised of three primary operating segments which correspond with our reportable business segments: Steel Processing; Pressure Cylinders; and Engineered Cabs. The Steel Processing operating segment consists of the Worthington Steel business unit (“Worthington Steel”) which operates eight manufacturing facilities (seven of which we own); and three consolidated joint ventures: Spartan Steel Coating, LLC (“Spartan”), which operates a cold-rolled, hot-dipped galvanizing line in Monroe, Michigan; TWB Company, L.L.C. (“TWB”), which operates 10 laser welded blank facilities and is headquartered in Monroe, Michigan; and Worthington Specialty Processing (“WSP”), which processes wide-sheet steel for the auto industry and operates three facilities in Michigan.  The Pressure Cylinders operating segment consists of the Worthington Cylinders business unit (“Worthington Cylinders”), which includes recently-acquired New AMTROL Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “AMTROL”), and operates 24 manufacturing facilities. The Engineered Cabs operating segment consists of the Worthington Industries Engineered Cabs business unit (“Engineered Cabs”), which operates four manufacturing facilities. 
 
Effective June 1, 2017, Worthington Steelpac Systems, LLC (“Packaging Solutions”), which designs and manufactures recyclable steel packaging solutions for the movement of products and operates one manufacturing facility, was realigned under the Engineered Cabs operating segment, moving from the Steel Processing operating segment. See the Recent Developments section below.
 
On June 2, 2017, we acquired AMTROL, which operates as part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment.  See the Recent Developments section below.
 1



We hold equity positions in 9 joint ventures, which are further discussed in the Joint Ventures section below.  Of these, Spartan, TWB and WSP are consolidated with their operating results reported within our Steel Processing operating segment.
 
During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”), the Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs operating segments served approximately 800, 4,500, and 65 customers, respectively, located primarily in the United States.  International operations accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2018 and were comprised primarily of sales to customers in Europe.  No single customer accounted for over 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018. 
 Refer to “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note N – Segment Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of our reportable business segments.
 Recent Developments
 Effective June 1, 2017, we made certain organizational changes impacting the internal reporting and management structure of Packaging Solutions.  As a result of these organizational changes, management responsibilities and internal reporting were realigned, moving Packaging Solutions from the Steel Processing reportable segment to the Engineered Cabs reportable segment, where we expect to achieve synergies in design engineering and manufacturing development.
 
On June 2, 2017, we acquired AMTROL, a leading manufacturer of pressure cylinders and water system tanks, which is part of our Pressure Cylinders reportable segment.  AMTROL has manufacturing facilities in Rhode Island, Kentucky and Maryland which also produce refrigerant gas cylinders and ASME code products for industrial and commercial applications.  Its Portuguese subsidiary, AMTROL-ALFA, is a leading European producer of LPG, refrigerant, industrial and specialty gas cylinders.  The aggregate merger consideration for AMTROL was approximately $291.9 million after closing adjustments.   A portion of the merger consideration was used to pay off certain indebtedness and other liabilities of AMTROL.
 On November 20, 2017, we announced that our joint venture Worthington Armstrong Venture (“WAVE”) has agreed to sell its business and operations in Europe and Asia, to the Knauf Group, a family-owned manufacturer of building materials headquartered in Germany.  The WAVE businesses and operations in the Americas are not part of this transaction.  The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close before the end of calendar 2018. 
 
On March 31, 2018, we sold a 65% stake in Worthington Energy Innovations, LLC (“WEI”) to its founder, Tom Kiser, who already owned 20% of the business. We now hold a 10% equity interest and will have a passive role in the business. 
 On May 23, 2018, we acquired the remaining 25% ownership interest in Turkey-based Worthington Arıtaş Basınçlı Kaplar Sanayi (“Worthington Aritas”), a manufacturer of cryogenic pressure vessels for LNG and other gas storage applications.  Management committed to a plan to sell this business in a non-cash transaction.  The net assets of Worthington Aritas are now classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets.
 Steel Processing
 Our Steel Processing reportable segment consists of the Worthington Steel business unit, our consolidated joint ventures, Spartan, TWB and, beginning with the last quarter of fiscal 2016, WSP.  It also included Packaging Solutions through May 31, 2017.  For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by the Steel Processing operating segment was approximately 63%, 69% and 65%, respectively.
 
Worthington Steel is one of the largest independent intermediate processors of flat-rolled steel in the United States.  It occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications.  These products cannot typically be supplied as efficiently by steel mills to the end-users of these products.
 
2


As of May 31, 2018, the Steel Processing reportable segment, including Spartan, TWB, and WSP, operated 22 manufacturing facilities located in Ohio (5), Michigan (5), Mexico (5), Tennessee (2), Indiana (1), Alabama (1), Kentucky (1), New York (1), and Canada (1).  
 
Our Steel Processing reportable segment serves approximately 800 customers, principally in the automotive, aerospace, agricultural, appliance, construction, container, hardware, HVAC, lawn and garden, leisure and recreation, office furniture and office equipment markets.  The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for our Steel Processing operating segment.  For fiscal 2018, Steel Processing’s top three customers represented approximately 32% of the operating segment’s total net sales.
 
Our Steel Processing reportable segment buys coils of steel from integrated steel mills and mini-mills and processes them to the precise type, thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality required by customer specifications.  Computer-aided processing capabilities include, among others:
 
 
• | cold reducing, which achieves close tolerances of thickness;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | configured blanking, which mechanically stamps steel into specific shapes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coil fed laser blanking, which uses lasers to cut coils of steel, aluminum and other metals into specific shapes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cutting-to-length, which cuts coils into sheets of exact length;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | dry-lube, the process of coating steel with a dry, soap-based lubricant;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hot-dipped galvanizing, which coats steel with zinc and zinc alloys through a hot-dip process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hydrogen annealing, a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laser welding, which joins steel or aluminum blanks and coils with different thicknesses, coatings or material strength;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pickling, a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot-rolled steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | slitting, which cuts steel coils or steel sheets to specific widths;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | oscillate slitting, a slitting process that spools together several narrow coils welded end-to-end into one larger coil;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | temper rolling, which is the process of light cold-rolling steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tension leveling, a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | non-metallic coating, including acrylic and paint coating. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Steel Processing reportable segment also toll processes steel for steel mills, large end-users, service centers and other processors.  Toll processing is different from typical steel processing in that the mill, end-user or other party retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product.  Toll processing enhances Worthington Steel’s participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders, a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors.

The steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive.  There are many competitors, including other independent intermediate processors.  Competition is primarily on the basis of price, product quality and the ability to meet delivery requirements.  Technical service and support for material testing and customer-specific applications enhance the quality of products (see the Technical Services section below).  However, the extent to which technical service capability has improved Worthington Steel’s competitive position has not been quantified.  Worthington Steel’s ability to meet tight delivery schedules is, in part, based on the proximity of our facilities to customers, suppliers and one another.  The extent to which plant location has impacted Worthington Steel’s competitive position has not been quantified.  Processed steel products are priced competitively, primarily based on market factors, including, among other things, market pricing, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs, and overall economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
 Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the operations of Packaging Solutions were realigned, moving from the Steel Processing reportable segment to the Engineered Cabs reportable segment. 
 Pressure Cylinders
 The Pressure Cylinders reportable segment consists of the Worthington Cylinders business unit and Worthington Aritas.  Worthington Aritas is a manufacturer of cryogenic pressure vessels for LNG and other gas storage applications.  The percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by Pressure Cylinders was approximately 34%, 28% and 30% in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.  We acquired AMTROL on June 2, 2017, which has been included in the Pressure Cylinders reportable segment since that date, and accounted for approximately 7% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018.
 Our Pressure Cylinders reportable segment manufactures and sells filled and unfilled pressure cylinders, tanks, hand torches, well water and expansion tanks, and oil and gas equipment along with various accessories and related products for diversified end-use market applications.  The following is a description of these markets:

While a large percentage of Pressure Cylinders sales are made to major accounts, this operating segment served approximately 4,500 customers during fiscal 2018.  No single customer represented greater than 10% of net sales for the Pressure Cylinders operating segment during fiscal 2018.  
 
The Pressure Cylinders reportable segment, operates 24 manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, California, Kansas (2), Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio (6), Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin, Austria, Poland (2), Portugal (2) and Turkey.  
 
For sales in the United States and Canada, high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders are primarily manufactured in accordance with United States Department of Transportation and Transport Canada specifications.  Outside the United States and Canada, cylinders are manufactured according to European norm specifications, as well as various other international standards.  Other products are produced to applicable industry standards including, as applicable, those standards issued by the American Petroleum Institute, ASME and UL.
 
Worthington Cylinders has one principal domestic competitor in the low-pressure LPG cylinder market, and there are a number of foreign competitors in the LPG cylinder market and in the non-refillable refrigerant market.  We believe that Worthington Cylinders has the largest market share in its domestic low-pressure cylinder markets.  In the other cylinder markets, there are several competitors.  Worthington Cylinders is a leading supplier to the European markets for both the high-pressure cylinders and the low-pressure non-refillable cylinders.  Worthington Cylinders generally has a strong competitive position for its industrial, energy, retail and specialty products, but competition varies on a product-by-product basis, and geographically for energy products.  As with our other operating segments, competition is based upon price, service and quality.
 
The Pressure Cylinders reportable segment uses the trade names “Worthington Cylinders”, “AMTROL” and “Alfa” to conduct business.
 The Company uses the registered trademark “Balloon Time®” to market helium-filled balloon kits; the registered trademark “BERNZOMATIC®” to market certain fuel cylinders and hand held torches; the trademark “WORTHINGTON PRO-GRADE” to market certain LPG cylinders, hand torches and camping fuel cylinders; and the registered trademarks “MAP-PRO®” and “Pro-Max®” to market certain hand torch cylinders; “Therm-X-Trol®” and “Extrol®” to market thermal expansion tanks; “Well X Trol®”, “Champion®”, and “Wel-Flo and Design®” to market well tanks; and “Hydromax®” and “Boilermate®” to market indirect fired water heaters.
 Engineered Cabs
 The Engineered Cabs reportable segment consists of the Worthington Industries Engineered Cabs business unit and, effective June 1, 2017, our Packaging Solutions business.  For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by the Engineered Cabs operating segment was approximately 3%, 3%, and 4%, respectively.
 
Engineered Cabs is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and operates four manufacturing facilities, one each in Indiana, Ohio, South Dakota and Tennessee, which are located near key assembly locations of original equipment manufacturers.
 
Engineered Cabs is a non-captive designer and manufacturer of high-quality, custom-engineered open and enclosed cabs and operator stations and custom fabrications and packaging for heavy mobile equipment used primarily in the agricultural, construction, forestry, military and mining industries.  Engineered Cabs’ product design, engineering support and broad manufacturing capabilities enable it to produce custom cabs and structures used in products ranging from small utility equipment to the large earthmovers.  Packaging Solutions designs and manufactures reusable custom steel platforms, racks and pallets for supporting, protecting and handling products throughout the shipping process.
 
In addition to its engineered cab products, this operating segment has the capability to provide a full suite of complementary products such as machined structural components, complex and painted weldments, and engine doors.  Engineered Cabs has the manufacturing capability for steel laser cutting, steel bending and forming, roll-form tube curving and bending, machining, welding – robotic and manual, automated steel product cleaning and E-coating, top coat painting and assembly.

Engineered Cabs produces products for approximately 100 different equipment platforms for approximately 65 customers.  For fiscal 2018, Engineered Cabs’ top three customers represented approximately 55% of the operating segment’s total net sales.  Its production levels can range from small and medium production volumes through high volume productions.
 
Engineered Cabs competes with a limited number of non-captive producers of engineered cabs in the United States, although there are numerous other suppliers who can perform various functions supplied by the Company.  Some customers can also produce operator cabs in-house.  The Company’s competitive strengths include design and engineering capabilities as well as broad manufacturing capabilities, often providing a fully-integrated complete cab at a more effective cost than customers can produce in-house.  Competitive drivers are related to innovation, quality, delivery and service.  
 
Key supplies for this operating segment include steel sheet and plate, stampings, steel tubing, hardware, controls, wiper systems, glazing materials (glass, polycarbonate), perishables (paint, urethane, caulk), electrical materials, HVAC systems and aesthetic materials (acoustical trim, plastics, foam), which are available from a variety of sources.  
 As noted above, effective June 1, 2017, the operations of Packaging Solutions were realigned, moving from the Steel Processing reportable segment to the Engineered Cabs reportable segment.  Packaging Solutions operates one facility in Indiana.
 Segment Financial Data
 Financial information for the reportable business segments is provided in “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note N – Segment Data”.  
 Financial Information About Geographic Areas
 For fiscal 2018, our international operations represented 9% of our consolidated net sales, 6% of our net earnings attributable to controlling interest and 14% of our consolidated net assets.  During fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we had consolidated operations in Austria, Canada, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Turkey and the United States.  During these same three fiscal years, our unconsolidated joint ventures had operations in China, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States.  As noted in the Recent Developments section above, our joint venture WAVE has agreed to sell its business and operations in Europe and Asia.  The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close before the end of calendar 2018.  Summary information about our foreign operations, including net sales and fixed assets by geographic region, is provided in “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note A – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Risks and Uncertainties” and “Note N – Segment Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Suppliers 
 The primary raw material purchased by Worthington is steel.  We purchase steel in large quantities at regular intervals from major primary producers of steel, both domestic and foreign. The amount purchased from any particular supplier varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including market conditions, then current relationships and prices and terms offered.  In nearly all market conditions, steel is available from a number of suppliers and generally any supplier relationship or contract can and has been replaced with little or no significant interruption to our business.  During fiscal 2018, we purchased approximately 2.7 million tons of steel (73% hot-rolled, 12% cold-rolled and 15% galvanized) on a consolidated basis.  
 In the Steel Processing operating segment, steel is primarily purchased and processed based on specific customer orders.  The Pressure Cylinders and Engineering Cabs operating segments purchase steel to meet production schedules.  For certain raw materials, there are more limited suppliers -- for example, helium and zinc, which are generally purchased at market prices.  Since there are a limited number of suppliers in the helium and zinc markets, if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted due to a force majeure type occurrence, it may be difficult to obtain an alternative supply.  Raw materials are generally purchased in the open market on a negotiated spot-market basis at prevailing market prices.  Supply contracts are also entered into, some of which have fixed pricing and some of which are indexed (monthly or quarterly).  During fiscal 2018, we purchased steel from the following major 
 6


suppliers, in alphabetical order: AK Steel Holding Corporation; ArcelorMittal; NLMK USA; North Star BlueScope Steel, LLC; Nucor Corporation; Steel Dynamics, Inc.; and United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”).  Major suppliers of aluminum to the Pressure Cylinders operating segment in fiscal 2018 were, in alphabetical order:  Arconic Inc.; DK Resources Limited; Geumsan Tech; Meyer Aluminum; Sapa Group and Shanghai Everskill.  Major suppliers of zinc to the Steel Processing operating segment in fiscal 2018 were, in alphabetical order: Considar Metal Marketing Inc. (a/k/a HudBay); Glencore Ltd; and Teck Resources Limited.  Approximately 29.1 million pounds of zinc and 4.9 million pounds of aluminum were purchased in fiscal 2018.  We believe our supplier relationships are good.
 Technical Services 
 We employ a staff of engineers and other technical personnel, and we maintain fully equipped laboratories to support operations.  These facilities enable verification, analysis and documentation of the physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of raw materials and products.  Technical Service personnel also work in conjunction with the sales force to specify components and materials required to fulfill customer needs.  Engineers at Engineered Cabs design cabs and cab manufacturing processes according to applicable industry standards. To provide these services, we maintain a continuing program of developmental engineering with respect to product characteristics and product performance under applicable operating conditions.  Laboratory facilities also perform metallurgical and chemical testing as dictated by the regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and other associated agencies, along with International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM International, and other customer and industry specific requirements.  An IASI (International Accreditations Service, Incorporated) accredited product material testing laboratory supports some of these efforts.
Seasonality and Backlog
 Sales are generally strongest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as our operating segments are generally operating at seasonal peaks.  Historically, sales have generally been weaker in the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to reduced activity in the building and construction industry as a result of inclement weather, as well as customer plant shutdowns, particularly in the automotive industry, due to holidays.  We do not believe backlog is a significant indicator of our business.
Employees
 As of May 31, 2018, we had approximately 12,000 employees, including those employed by our unconsolidated joint ventures.  Approximately 9% of our consolidated labor force is represented by collective bargaining units.  Worthington believes it has good relationships with its employees, including those covered by collective bargaining units.
Joint Ventures
 As part of our strategy to selectively develop new products, markets and technological capabilities and to expand our international presence, while mitigating the risks and costs associated with those activities, as of May 31, 2018, we participated in three consolidated and six unconsolidated joint ventures.
Consolidated
 The results of the following three consolidated joint ventures have been consolidated with the financial results of the Company since the respective dates on which the Company acquired majority ownership or effective control.  The equity owned by the minority members is shown as noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets and their portions of net earnings are included as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of earnings.  The financial results of all of our consolidated joint ventures are consolidated within the Steel Processing operating segment.
