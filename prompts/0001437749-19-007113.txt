ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Petrogress, Inc. was incorporated on February 10, 2010 under the laws of the State of Florida as 800 Commerce, Inc. ("800 Commerce") for the purpose of marketing credit card processing services on behalf of merchant payment processing service providers. On February 29, 2016, 800 Commerce entered into an Agreement concerning the Exchange of Securities ("SEA") with Petrogres Co. Limited, a Marshall Islands corporation, and its sole shareholder, Christos Traios, a Greek citizen. Under the terms of the SEA, 800 Commerce issued 136,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, representing approximately 85% of the post-transaction issued and outstanding shares, to Mr. Traios in exchange for 100% of the shares of Petrogres Co. Limited.
 
800 Commerce's acquisition of Petrogres Co. Limited effected a change in control and was accounted for as a "reverse acquisition" whereby Petrogres Co. Limited was the acquirer for financial statement purposes. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of 800 Commerce are those of Petrogres Co. Limited and its subsidiaries from their respective inception and those of the consolidated entity subsequent to the February 29, 2016 transaction date.
 
On March 9, 2016, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to Petrogress, Inc.

On November 16, 2016, Petrogress, Inc. filed Articles of Merger and Plan of Merger in Florida and Delaware to change the Company’s domicile by merging with and into a Delaware corporation formed solely for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation.
 
The Company operates as a fully integrated international merchant of petroleum products, focused on the supply and trade of light petroleum fuel oil (LPFO), refined oil products and other petrochemical products to local refineries in West Africa and Mediterranean countries. The Company operates as a holding company and provides its services primarily through its four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Petrogres Co.

Competition
 
The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand. The Company competes for charters on the basis of price, vessel location, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on the Company’s reputation. The Company competes primarily with other independent tanker vessel owners and with major oil companies that own and operate their own vessels. The Company’s competitors may have more resources than the Company and may operate vessels that are newer, and therefore more attractive to charterers, than the Company’s vessels. Ownership of tanker vessels is highly fragmented and is divided among publicly listed companies, state-controlled owners and private shipowners.
 
Although the Company believes that at the present time no single company has a dominant position in the markets in which the Company competes, that could change and the Company may face substantial competition for medium- to long-term charters from a number of experienced companies who may have greater resources or experience than the Company does when the Company tries to re-charter its vessels. The Company believes the Company’s ability to comply better with the rigorous standards of major oil companies relative to less qualified or experienced operators allows the Company to effectively compete for new charters.
 
Employees
 
As of April 12, 2019, Petrogress Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries employed 10 employees located in Greece through Petrogres Hellas Co., a branch of Petrogres Co. Limited. Petrogres Africa Company Limited has 10 employees located in Ghana, through, a subsidiary of Petrogress Int’l LLC and approximately 65 full-time laborers and crew members are employed by Petronav Carriers LLC.
