ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
General
 
We are a reporting issuer in British Columbia and Ontario, and have our shares of common stock listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol “BAMM”, with a head office located at 750 – 1095 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2M6.
 
We were originally incorporated on November 5, 1998 in the State of Delaware under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, we acquired 100% of Kaleidoscope Venture Capital, Inc. (formerly Vocalscape Networks, Inc.) and changed our name to Vocalscape, Inc. In November 2005, we changed our name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc. In September 2008, we changed our name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (“Deploy Tech”) and effective November 13, 2017, we changed our name to Body and Mind, Inc. (“Body and Mind”).
 
On September 15, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (“Deploy”) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, Deploy completed a merger with Deploy Tech, its former parent company, pursuant to which Deploy was the surviving corporation and assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech. Upon the completion of the merger Deploy assumed the name “Deploy Technologies Inc.” and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploy’s issued and outstanding common stock. On May 10, 2011, we registered as an extra-provincial company in British Columbia and on September 30, 2011, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 2,900,000 shares of our authorized capital stock as Class A Preferred Shares (the “Preferred Shares”). On September 2, 2014, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the authorized Preferred Shares from 2,900,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares. On November 11, 2014, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our authorized as well as the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Common Shares”) on the basis of one (1) new share for ten (10) old shares which resulted in a reduction of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 Common Shares to 10,000,000 Common Shares and our issued and outstanding Common Shares decreasing from 23,130,209 Common Shares to approximately 2,313,021 Common Shares. On April 11, 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized capital from 10,000,000 Common Shares to 900,000,000 Common Shares.
 
On August 10, 2017, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Dep Nevada Inc. (“DEP”). On September 14, 2017, we, with DEP, entered into a definitive agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“NMG”), an arm’s length party, to carry out the business combination transaction initially announced on May 17, 2017, following the signing of the letter of intent between Toro Pacific Management Inc. (“Toro”) and NMG (the “Letter of Intent”), which was assigned to us pursuant to an assignment and novation agreement among Toro, NMG, and us dated effective May 12, 2017 (the “Assignment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Toro received 470,000 of our Common Shares. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we changed our name to “Body and Mind, Inc.” effective on November 14, 2017 by filing a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State and at the same time we cancelled our entire authorized class of Preferred Shares. In addition, on November 14, 2017, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of one (1) new share for three (3) old shares (the “Consolidation”) which resulted in there being 28,239,876 Common Shares issued and outstanding post-Consolidation. DEP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of NMG in exchange for the issuance of our Common Shares on a post-consolidation basis and certain cash and other non-cash consideration, as further described below (the “Acquisition”). Completion of the Acquisition resulted in a fundamental change under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”). Subsequent to completion of the Acquisition, we filed articles of exchange with the Nevada Secretary of State.

We completed a concurrent equity financing to raise aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$6,007,429.89 through the issuance of subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”) with each Subscription Receipt convertible into one pre-Consolidation Common Share and one common share purchase warrant (each a “Warrant”) of Body and Mind, at a price of CAD$0.22 per Subscription Receipt (the “Concurrent Financing”). Each Warrant is exercisable by the holder at a price of CAD$0.30 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance. Each Warrant is subject to acceleration provisions following May 14, 2018, if the closing trading price of the Common Shares is equal to or greater than CAD$1.20 for seven consecutive trading days, at which time we may accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants by issuing a press release announcing the reduced warrant term whereupon the Warrants will expire 21 calendar days after the date of such press release.
 
In consideration for all of the issued securities of NMG, the NMG securityholders (collectively, the “NMG Members”) received, on a pro rata basis, (a) 16,000,000 post-Consolidation Common Shares (the “Payment Shares”) at a deemed price of CAD$0.66 per share (the “Share Exchange”), (b) $2,000,000 cash, and (c) five non-interest bearing promissory note for an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 (the “Promissory Notes”) issued as follows: $450,000 to MBK Investments, LLC, $450,000 to the Rozok Family Trust, $490,000 to KAJ Universal Real Estate Investments, LLC, $120,000 to NV Trees, LLC, and $490,000 to SW Fort Apache, LLC. The Promissory Notes were secured by a senior priority security interest in all of our assets, to be paid at the earlier of fifteen (15) months from the closing date of the Acquisition or, if an equity or debt financing subsequent to the Concurrent Financing is closed in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000, then within 30 days of the closing date of such subsequent financing. We assumed NMG’s obligations pursuant to a loan in the amount of $400,000, payable to TI Nevada, LLC, (“TI Nevada”) of which $225,000 was paid on the Closing Date (as defined below) and the remaining $175,000, which was secured by a senior priority security interest in all of our assets, will be paid within 15 months of the Closing Date. Furthermore, we reimbursed NMG $84,000 for expenditures incurred prior to the Closing Date which were related to the acquisition of production equipment. The amounts owing under the Promissory Notes as at July 31, 2018 (please see additional information regarding the promissory notes under the heading ‘Subsequent Events’) are as follows:
 

Promissory Note | Payment Date | Amount | 
-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------

Any Payment Shares received by a “Related Person” (as defined in the CSE Policy 1) in connection with the Acquisition, and certain other Payment Shares as may be required by the CSE (“Escrow Shares”), are subject to escrow conditions prescribed by the CSE pursuant to the terms of an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) entered into among us, the holders of Escrow Shares and New Horizon Transfer Inc., the escrow agent. Payment Shares received by the former members of NMG are subject to escrow under the rules and policies imposed by the CSE, and are further subject to voluntary pooling agreements entered into between us and the former members of NMG (the “Voluntary Pooling Agreements”), pursuant to which the Payment Shares will be released from pooling to the former members of NMG in accordance with the following schedule:
 

6 months after the Closing Date | 10% of the respective Payment Shares
---------------------------------+-------------------------------------
12 months after the Closing Date | 20% of the respective Payment Shares
18 months after the Closing Date | 25% of the respective Payment Shares
24 months after the Closing Date | 45% of the respective Payment Shares

The Acquisition closed on November 14, 2017 (the “Closing Date”). On completion of the Acquisition, we assumed the business of NMG, being the cultivation and production of medical marijuana products.
 
Intercorporate Relationships
 
We have the following subsidiaries: 
 

Name of Subsidiary | Place of Incorporation | Ownership Interest
--------------------------+------------------------+-------------------
DEP Nevada Inc. | Nevada, USA | 100% 
Nevada Medical Group, LLC | Nevada, USA | 100% 
Pepper Lane North, LLC | Nevada, USA | 50% 

 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, DEP, was formed on August 10, 2017. DEP holds 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in NMG.
 
On December 18, 2017, we reached an agreement with a real estate investment group, led by NMG’s President, Robert Hasman, which intended to purchase a building adjacent to our existing facility and lease it back to a newly formed entity called Pepper Lane North LLC (“PLN” or “Partnership”) on a long-term basis with renewal options. PLN is a strategic partnership between the Company and a dispensary chain in the State of Nevada. The other PLN member intended to transfer an active cultivation license to the PLN facility and all expenditures under PLN were to be funded on a 50/50 basis by the PLN members. The new facility was expected to primarily consist of flowering rooms as production, packaging, distribution, and head office functions were to remain at the existing facility. We had also earmarked approximately 4,000 square feet of frontage for a dispensary upon receipt of a retail license. It was contemplated that at least half of the sales under PLN would be sold to the other PNL member through their existing dispensary network. In addition, we had signed an operating and management agreement with PLN and were to receive the greater of $15,000/month or 10% of PLN’s net profits. Prior to forming PLN, the members of PLN engaged surveyors to ensure compliance with permitting procedures and that PLN would receive the necessary approvals to move forward. During the nine months ended April 30, 2018 we were notified that a church was located in close proximity of the building and that permitting was unlikely to proceed. We have filed an insurance claim with the surveyor’s insurer to recover our deposit of $250,000 for the purchase of the building and our out of pocket damages. As a result of these events, the operating and management agreement with PLN have been terminated. In addition, as a result of these events PLN is expected to be dissolved once the claim has been resolved. 
 
It is the Company’s position that the Partnership agreement is null and void due to the fact that the Company was provided with incorrect information prior to signing the agreement. Therefore, we are of the view that the deposit is now recoverable from the surveyors and/or their insurer as a result of the negligence of the surveyors. 
 
The $250,000 deposit and additional claim to recover out of pocket damages over and above the deposit amount is considered a contingent asset and is expensed in the financial statements of the Company as at July 31, 2018 in accordance with ASC 450-30.

Business Operations
 
Past business of Deploy
 
We were a development stage company engaged in designing and developing technologies and products for the management of truck fleets by companies in the freight haulage, waste haulage, mining, industrial operations and manufacturing, military and law enforcement industries.
 
We identified our proprietary technology and primary product by the name “Fleet Data Management & Weigh System”. The principal and unique feature of the Fleet Data Management & Weigh System enables operators of heavy industrial hydraulic lifting equipment to weigh cargo “on-the-fly” during the process of loading carrier vehicles. The load weight of trucks is important information for several purposes, including billing, compliance with highway and safety regulations and loading within capacity specifications. We designed and developed the Fleet Data Management & Weigh System to provide this information, as well as much more, on a real-time basis. The Fleet Data Management & Weigh System is capable of providing such information for in-cab entry and can deliver the information by wireless communication to operations centers, billing departments and for archival purposes, in order to meet the needs of any fleet operator.
 
Following the 2008 acquisition by our predecessor entity of the on-the-fly weigh system technology from Trepped Enterprises Inc., we devoted much of our time to engineering; circuit board design and testing; firmware and software development and testing; adding components and features; hardware selection; and improving, testing and packaging the Fleet Data Management & Weigh System. Upon the completion of our merger with Deploy Tech, we acquired the rights to both the technology and products that comprise the system by virtue of being the surviving corporation. 
 
We developed a final prototype of the products that comprise our Fleet Data Management & Weigh System. We have tested both prototype packages on various types of vehicles. We have experienced delays due to lack of required funding which resulted in less attention on sales and marketing than expected. 
 
Due to the large number of different vehicles and vehicle models that contain variations in parts, our system had to be tested on each variation of a vehicle before it can be sold to customers to ensure that it is properly calibrated for that specific vehicle. This significantly increases our testing and sales timelines. 
 
Throughout our 2014 fiscal year, our management was focused on sales of our products as well as raising capital required to achieve our sales and marketing goals. We were not successful in raising required capital to hire sales and marketing staff or launch a sales and marketing campaign and therefore restructured the company to be more attractive to the investment community. 
 
Although a lack of funding caused delays in sales and marketing efforts, we were able to remain current in our reporting obligations, including the year-end requirements to file our audited financial statements, MD&A and annual listing statement.
 
Throughout our previous three years, we had developed and patented and had been selling our Fleet Data Management & Weigh System and prepared the Company for commercialization of our product line. We remain the owner of Patent # 2798525 which is titled as “Load-Measuring, Fleet Asset Tracking and Data Management System for Load-Lifting Vehicles.” While we continue to own and maintain this patent, our focus has changed to the business of cultivating and producing medical and recreational marijuana as further described in the “Description of Business” below. We anticipate selling our patent in the foreseeable future and do not anticipate allocating any current or future resources to our prior business.

Description of Business
 
NMG was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 3, 2014. NMG was an early applicant in Nevada in 2014 and was awarded one of the first state medical licences for both cultivation and production of marijuana. NMG has been a licensed producer and cultivator of cannabis products since it was issued its first cultivation license on November 5, 2015 and production license on December 10, 2015. On July 1, 2017 NMG was awarded an additional state recreational cultivation and production license. NMG operates under its marquee brand name of Body & Mind Inc. (“BaM”) and produces flower, oil extracts and edibles and are available for sale in dispensaries in Nevada and soon to be Ohio. 
 
NMG anticipates an increase in demand due to the recently approved “Adult Use” licensing in the State of Nevada that began in July 2017. NMG has several growth initiatives underway including new product introductions, product licensing, third party extraction, out-of-State licensing, and acquisitions.
 
In the 12 months following the completion of the Acquisition, we intend to:
 

(1) | Increase product availability in Nevada and Ohio; and
----+------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Lower cost of production. 

Milestones
 
The following table outlines how we intend to achieve the objectives enumerated above.
 

Objective | Milestone | Anticipated Cost | | Timeline from October 29, 2018 | 
------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+---------+--------------------------------+---------------
Increase product availability | Increase new edible products and increase flower production | $ | 150,000 | | Up to 120 days
Lower cost of production | Installation of cultivation equipment and rolling benches | $ | 250,000 | | Up to 60 days 

Improve Existing Facility
 
On June 28, 2018 we obtained a building permit from Clark County, Nevada. As of November 9, 2018 our expansion project for the Nevada facility is now complete. We are currently outfitting each room with rolling benches and water systems and estimate harvesting toward the end of calendar 2018, thus increasing our product availability while lowering our cost of production.
Increase Product Availability
 
Additionally,  we are increasing new edible products. We’ve determined the edible market is a sector of the marijuana industry with a high profit margin. To capitalize on this, we have made a dedicated effort to hire an individual with an extensive background in confectionary products and proper dosing techniques.
 
Since her hiring on March 6, 2018, we have maintained a consistent passing of all state-mandated testing of our edibles regarding dosing.
 
In addition, the Company has implemented improved recipes of our established edible products which has increased our product’s shelf life and improved taste. The Company has implemented an improved recipe for our Gummy products, which is our top selling edible. The Company developed additional preparation methods for our dried fruit line and we have a state approved recipe to make and sell a Fruit Roll-Up edible using all-natural ingredients. This will increase our fruit offerings to 7 products (3 types of dried fruits and 4 fruit based Roll-Ups).

Due to changes in the Nevada Regulations, we are in the process of improving and standardizing our Beef Jerky products. Our beef jerky recipes have been approved by the state, and we are developing the process to standardize the finished product. This will ensure each packaged edible is consistent in the amount of marijuana per piece. By standardizing the cooking process and final product, we can add new flavors to our product offerings. We are currently offering 3 flavors of Beef Jerky, and this number of flavors can be increased or decreased easily to flow with any changes in the edible market. With the standardization of the Beef Jerky preparation process, we plan to add spin off products such as beef based Doggie Treats infused with CBD instead of THC. We have a Doggie Treat recipe approved by the State of Nevada.
 
We have also developed recipes for the following items which we anticipate bringing to market:
 

· | Micro Dosed Tablets (A Mint Type of Product) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
· | Chocolate Confections (Candy Bars and/or Chocolate Pieces)
· | Short Bread Cookies 
· | Fruit-Based Jam 

Lower Cost of Production
 
As Flower continues to be the foundation product for Marijuana industry, we are striving for continuous improvement to our cultivation process. Our aim will always focus on increasing the production yields of each harvest, and to obtain the highest quality product harvest. Doing so, achieves two things for us and our customers: 1) allows us to maximize the profit of our company and 2) gives our customers the best value for their dollar by offering highly potent THC. By September 2018, we will have 3 additional grow rooms operating which will increase our overall flower production. We have a record-keeping systems in place to aid us in selecting flower strains that produce the largest yields and the highest THC. Our record-keeping system tracks room metrics, nutrient intake of the plants, and other vital metrics which helps us identify the best possible conditions for the plant to maximize its yield.
 
We are in the process of installing a centralized AC control system throughout our facility. This system will help us track each room’s environmental metrics and help us maintain a proactive response in the event of any equipment failure. In addition to the centralized AC control system, we are in the planning stage of installing a CO2 system in our grow rooms. This CO2 system will pump in Carbon Dioxide into the grow rooms which we expect to increase our flower yields by approximately 20 carbon dioxide, and humidity levels in each grow room. This will give us a real time reading of our grow rooms, allowing us to make adjustments in real time.
 
Financing
 
We expect to raise additional funds and meet our payment obligations either through equity financings, debt financing and/or business acquisitions. We anticipate utilizing the above to raise approximately $4,000,000 within the next six months. The funds will be used to pay the $2,175,000 in promissory notes due on or before February 2019, approximately $500,000 for dispensary construction in Ohio and the remainder to be used for general working capital (see additional information under the heading ‘Subsequent Events’).
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all food and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce (with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products). At this time, the Company’s edible food products are not introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, and FDA approval of the Company’s edible products is not required. However, the Company must, and does, comply with food labeling requirements set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and the Nevada Department of Taxation, which include: a statement of identity, net quantity of contents, ingredient statement, manufacturer information, nutritional labeling, “use-by” date, safe handling instructions, an allergen statement, “Keep out of reach of children” statement, “THIS IS A MARIJUANA PRODUCT” statement, cannabinoid profile, terpenoid profile, total amount of THC, the Company’s production license number, production run number, date of production, date of final testing, date on which the product was packaged, etc.
 
The Company’s operations as a licensed cultivator and producer of marijuana and marijuana products could be found in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act. Due to this, the Company may face higher federal income tax liability as it is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a cannabis company from deducting any expenses from their income on the its federal income tax return, except for those considered to be cost of goods sold (COGS). While this severely impacts marijuana retailers, as opposed to cultivators and producers, the Company does face higher federal income tax liability than a non-cannabis company.

The State of Nevada, per Nevada Revised Statutes Section 372A.290, has implemented the following taxes on marijuana and marijuana products: (i) a fifteen percent (15%) excise tax on the wholesale sale which is paid by the cultivator and is calculated on the fair market value at wholesale set by the Department of Taxation, and (ii) a ten percent (10%) excise tax on the retail sale which is paid by the retail store. The Company is obligated to collect and remit the wholesale cultivation tax on all wholesale sales and file the appropriate tax returns on a monthly basis. The Company currently does not have retail operations in Nevada, and therefore is not required to collect and/or remit any retail taxes. All marijuana and marijuana products sold at retail must also pay and remit sales taxes at the applicable local sales tax level. The Company currently does not have retail operations, and thus is not required to collect and/or remit any sales taxes.

Distribution Methods
 
We currently sell directly to licensed Nevada Dispensaries. We have no direct sales channels to the public. Our products are delivered directly to each dispensary by licensed distribution companies.
 
Competitive business conditions
 
Supply & Demand - as our competitors expand operations, there is more supply creating less demand. We need to provide high quality products, excellent customer service, and competitive prices.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials
 
Finished Flower – our clones are all produced in house using our mother plants as the source. Mothers are readily available to purchase throughout Nevada. Our coco growing medium (soil like material) is the only component of raw materials that is produced outside of our control. Coco suppliers are readily available in the event of a loss of our supplier. We produce our nutrients in-house using basic nutrients readily available in the cultivation market. Our packaging is produced overseas, and suppliers are readily available. 
 
Pre-Rolled Joints – our flower buds produce the material for our pre-rolls. All of our pre-roll packaging is easily obtained. There are numerous suppliers of joint paper, joint vials, and other joint packaging materials. 
 
BHO Concentrates – our flower is used to produce our concentrates. All the chemicals, supplies, and equipment required to produce BHO can be easily obtained.
 
Disposable Vape Pens – our flower is used to produce the oil placed in the vape pen. The vape pen and packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers, but again, there are plenty of suppliers that can meet our demand if needed.
 
Distillate Oil - our flower is used to produce the oil placed in the vape pen. The vape cartridge and packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers, but again, there are plenty of suppliers that can meet our demand if needed. Same goes for the chemicals need to produce the product. All chemicals are common and readily available for purchase
 
Rosin – our flower is used to produce the rosin. Our packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers, but again, there are plenty of suppliers to meet our demand
 
Edibles – all ingredients are locally sourced. We use our in house produced distillate oil to infuse all the edibles
 
We will cultivate and produce medical and recreational marijuana products such as flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name “Body and Mind”.
 
We have built our business plan around capitalizing on medical-use and recreational cannabis market. The regulated medical recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. As of July 2018, 30 states and the District of Columbia, have passed laws allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis.

State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor’s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. In Nevada, an applicant of a medical-use cannabis card must obtain verification from attending provider of health care that the person has been diagnosed with a chronic or debilitating medical condition, and its symptoms may be mitigated by the medical use of marijuana. Nevada has characterized the following as “chronic or debilitating medical conditions”: acquired immune deficiency syndrome; cancer, glaucoma, a medical condition or treatment for a medical condition that produces cachexia, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, severe nausea, or severe pain. The above list may be amended or added to from time to time. Nevada extends reciprocity for non-residents who hold a valid medical-use card in their state of residence, as long as the person abides by Nevada’s legal limits on the possession. Medical-use card holders may not possess more than two and one-half ounces of usable marijuana in any one 14-day period.
 
In Ohio, patients must have a qualifying medical condition to be eligible for a medical-use card. Such qualifying medical conditions include: HIV/AIDS; Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); cancer; chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); Crohn's disease; epilepsy or another seizure disorder; fibromyalgia; glaucoma; hepatitis C; inflammatory bowel disease; multiple sclerosis; pain that is chronic and severe, or intractable; Parkinson's disease; post-traumatic stress disorder; sickle cell anemia; spinal cord disease or injury; Tourette's syndrome; traumatic brain injury; and ulcerative colitis. Ohio prohibits smoking of medical-use cannabis, but permits oils, tinctures, plant material, edibles and patches. Ohio medical-use card holders may not possess more than a 90-day supply of medical marijuana, which is defined by form, as follows: plant material- no more than eight ounces of tier I medical marijuana, no more than five and three-tenths ounces of tier II medical marijuana; no more than twenty-six and fifty-five-hundredths grams of THC content in patches for transdermal administration or lotions, creams, or ointments for topical administration; no more than nine and nine-tenths grams of THC content in oil, tincture, capsule, or edible form for oral administration; no more than fifty-three and one-tenths grams of THC content in medical marijuana oil for vaporization.
 
We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation and production of products within the medical recreational use cannabis industry:
 

· | Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; 
· | Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;
· | NMG is currently in the process of obtaining a recreational distribution license; 
· | NMG currently has three main product lines: (i) flower, (ii) edibles, and (iii) extracts; and 
· | NMG currently cultivates recreational marijuana. 

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.
 
We use a state licensed distribution company to distribute our products and our primary market is in State of Nevada.
 
Competitive Business Conditions and Body and Mind’s Position in the Industry
 
Production and Sales
 
NMG has a number of licenses and a long-term lease for a facility allowing them to cultivate and produce medical and recreational marijuana. In addition to flower products we produce marijuana extract products such as distillate oil, ice wax, dry sift, shatter, edibles and topicals. 
Competitive Conditions
 
 The Nevada and Ohio Market
  We face competition from a variety of competitors. Several factors impacting competition include, but are not limited to, the quality control and consistency of products being produced, the hiring and retention of competent personnel within the industry, brand marketing and production costs. 
The United States Market
 
We face competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including but not limited to independent investors, hedge funds and other cannabis operators, all of whom may compete with us to acquire real estate zoned for medical-use and/or recreational-use cannabis facilities. The current market for medical and recreational marijuana products may be limited as more competitors enter the market.
