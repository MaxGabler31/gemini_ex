Item 1. Business of Community Health Systems, Inc.
 Overview of Our Company
 We are one of the largest publicly-traded providers of healthcare services in the United States and a leading operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities in communities across the country. We provide healthcare services through the hospitals and outpatient facilities that we own and operate in generally larger non-urban markets and selected urban markets throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or leased 83 hospitals with an aggregate of approximately 13,289 licensed beds, comprised of 81 general acute care hospitals and two stand-alone rehabilitation or psychiatric hospitals. Healthcare services are also provided in more than 1,000 outpatient facilities including affiliated physician practices, urgent care centers, freestanding emergency departments, occupational medicine clinics, imaging centers, cancer centers and ambulatory surgery centers. These hospitals and outpatient facilities are geographically diversified across 16 states, with the majority located in regional networks or in close geographic proximity to one or more of our other hospitals. We generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and specialized hospital healthcare services and outpatient services to patients in the communities in which we are located. Services provided through our hospitals and outpatient facilities include general acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. An integral part of providing these services is our network of affiliated physicians at our hospitals and affiliated businesses. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,500 physicians and an additional 900 licensed healthcare practitioners. Through our management and operation of these businesses, we provide standardization and centralization of operations across key business areas; strategic assistance to expand and improve services and facilities; implementation of patient safety and quality of care improvement programs and assistance in the recruitment of additional physicians and licensed healthcare practitioners to the markets in which our hospitals are located. In a number of our markets, we have partnered with local physicians, for-profit entities and/or not-for-profit providers in the ownership of our facilities.

 Our Business Strategy 
 The key elements of our business strategy are to:
 Become a market leader and increase market share in the communities we serve
 We operate across diverse markets that range from sole community providers to large regional networks. We are able to leverage our significant scale and standardized systems to provide cost-effective services and best practices for our affiliate operations. Each of our markets develops and executes a strategic plan with short- and long-term goals, based on their unique opportunities and the needs of their respective communities. As an organization, we also have implemented a number of strategic initiatives designed to improve market position, expand services to our patients, and capture a greater share of healthcare spending in our markets. These include:

• | Strengthening regional networks and local market operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 1


 
• | Expanding patient access points, health services and infrastructure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recruiting and/or employing additional primary care physicians and specialists; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing a more consumer-centric experience and facilitating connections between episodes of care.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Strengthening Regional Networks and Local Market Operations. We believe opportunities exist in select markets to create healthcare networks consisting of multiple hospitals and corresponding outpatient services.
 Regional networks are able to expand the breadth of services provided for our patients, develop centers of excellence for key services, deliver care in an organized and efficient way across the network, improve alignment with physicians and other providers, and make services more attractive to managed care and other payors. Currently, 48 of our hospitals operate in 13 unique regional networks.
 We also operate healthcare systems that are built around a single acute-care hospital. In these markets, we are focused on supporting the hospital with physician practices, outpatient services, clinical collaborations and partnerships that offer our patients health services across the continuum of care. These hospitals and their related outpatient services may operate in competitive markets or as sole community providers.
 Expanding Patient Access Points, Health Services and Infrastructure. When expanding services—in both the acute and non-acute care settings—our approach is data-driven and strategic to ensure our investments are responsive to community and patient needs and produce sound financial results. While we continue to provide health services across a broad spectrum, we have focused our attention and resources on service lines we believe have the greatest potential for growth, including primary care, emergency medicine, orthopedics, neuroscience, cardiovascular care, surgical services and behavioral health. Significant investments have been made in existing markets to expand the scale of inpatient offerings, including through increasing bed capacity and constructing new surgical and procedural suites. As the shift to delivering health services in outpatient settings accelerates, we continue to expand our care offerings beyond hospital walls to include more outpatient access through primary care practices, urgent care centers, free-standing emergency departments, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging and diagnostic centers, retail clinics and direct-to-consumer virtual health visits. We endeavor to advance the scale and breadth of inpatient and outpatient capabilities through both direct investments and strategic partnerships.
 We believe expanding our patient access footprint can attract new patients and increase patient retention, as well as our ability to connect patients from one episode of care to the next appropriate care setting. We also believe our investments will enhance our long-term growth and generate increased revenue, earnings, and operating margins by providing a solid return on investment.
 Recruiting and/or Employing Additional Primary Care Physicians and Specialists. The physician-patient relationship is the foundation on which healthcare services are built. Understanding this, we continuously assess our communities to identify service gaps and practice opportunities in order to recruit an optimal mix of primary care physicians and specialists. We analyze demographic data and referral trends and employ recruiters at the corporate level to support local hospital administrators in their physician recruitment efforts. In some markets, we employ physicians, often acquiring their practices at the onset of the arrangement. However, most physicians in our communities and on our medical staffs remain in private practice and are not our employees.
 We work hard to develop positive, collaborative relationships with physicians. We currently participate in 15 Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations which include approximately 4,000 employed and independent physicians in our communities. We look forward to realizing the benefits of these organizations, including opportunities to strengthen quality, deepen clinical collaboration and demonstrate performance under a reimbursement system moving toward more value-based incentives and payments.
 Developing a More Consumer-Centric Experience and Facilitating Connections between Episodes of Care. Consumers continue to take a more active role in healthcare decision-making, especially as they assume increasing responsibility for the cost of their healthcare. The rise in consumerism is highlighting customer expectations that have not always been prioritized in the healthcare setting. We are working on ways to create more enduring relationships with our patients by providing services that help people navigate their healthcare journeys and enable more seamless connections across episodes of care in our healthcare systems, hospitals, and physician practices. Some of these initiatives include:
  
• | A centralized and proprietary transfer center offering services to connect emergency department and hospitalized patients requiring transfer to facilities that can best meet their needs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Centralized patient scheduling call centers and online scheduling to ease appointment scheduling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient navigation and next appointment scheduling from existing points of care;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability of virtual health for certain services provided in the hospital and for direct-to-consumer, on-demand virtual visits with physicians and other healthcare practitioners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2


 
• | Digital marketing and consumer engagement campaigns; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Other technology enabled initiatives that support connected healthcare experiences, such as patient portals, text message appointment reminders, gaps-in-care campaigns and post-discharge surveys.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Increase productivity and operating efficiencies to enhance profitability
 Our hospital management teams are supported by experienced corporate leaders who have significant industry knowledge and a proven track record of success. Local hospitals benefit from centralized clinical, operational, financial and regulatory expertise that encompasses nearly every aspect of our business. Additionally, we are able to leverage deep and meaningful data sources to facilitate informed decision-making and drive operational improvements across the enterprise in areas such as drug and supply procurement, workforce optimization and staffing and emergency department and operating room performance.
 Standard policies and procedures in areas ranging from physician practice management to patient accounting to construction and facilities management help to facilitate best practices, reduce variation and improve operating results. The following areas highlight some of our standardized and centralized platforms.
 Billing and Collections. We have adopted standard policies and procedures with respect to billing and collections. We have automated various components of the collection cycle, including statements and collection letters, to help facilitate timely and accurate progression of our accounts through the collection cycle. We have consolidated local hospital billing and collection functions into five centralized business offices and have completed the transition of our hospital billing departments to this new infrastructure. We have been realizing the benefits of lower patient claim denials, higher underpayment recoveries and reduced operating costs.
 Physician Support. We support newly recruited physicians to facilitate a smooth and effective transition into our communities. For employed physicians, we utilize software solutions that monitor and help optimize their practice performance against industry standard benchmarks and best practices. We also have implemented programs to improve physician workflow, reduce physician turnover, optimize staffing at physician clinics and standardize onboarding processes.
 Procurement and Materials Management. We have standardized and centralized supply chain operations to improve procurement of the medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals used in our hospitals. We have an ownership interest in and participation agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HealthTrust, a group purchasing organization, or GPO, which benefits members through scaled pricing. HealthTrust contracts with certain vendors who supply a substantial portion of our medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals.
 Case and Resource Management. The primary goal of our case management program is to deliver safe, high-quality care in an efficient and cost effective manner. The program focuses on:
  
• | Appropriate management of length of stay consistent with national standards and benchmarks;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing unnecessary utilization;
--+----------------------------------


• | Developing and implementing operational best practices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Discharge planning; and
--+------------------------


• | Compliance with applicable regulatory standards.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Our case management program integrates the functions of utilization review, discharge planning, assessment of medical necessity and resource management. Patients are assessed upon presentation to the hospital and throughout their course of care with ongoing reviews. Industry-standard criteria are utilized in patient assessments and discharge plans are adjusted according to patient needs. Cases are monitored to prevent delays in service or unnecessary utilization of resources. When a patient is ready for discharge, a case manager works with the patient’s attending physician to evaluate and coordinate the patient’s needs for continued care in the post-acute setting. Hospitals have the support of a physician advisor to act as a liaison to the medical staff and assist with all the activities of the program.
 Other Initiatives. Numerous other initiatives have been standardized or centralized and leverage data to reduce costs and increase productivity. For example, we have improved staff scheduling and efficiency by implementing standardized time keeping systems, and we have implemented initiatives to reduce unnecessary overtime and guide temporary staffing decisions that align with patient admissions and acuity. We have created a centralized team and implemented standard processes for payroll processing and management of accounts payable. Likewise, we have leveraged data and expertise to optimize our performance in clinical and operating areas such as emergency room, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging and skilled nursing services and health information management. Each time we implement a new process initiative, we work to identify and communicate best practices and we monitor progress and performance improvement throughout the organization.

Continuously improve patient safety and quality of care
 We maintain quality assurance programs to monitor, support and advance quality of care standards and to meet Medicare and Medicaid accreditation and regulatory requirements. We maintain an emphasis on patient safety and clinical outcomes and we are continuously focused on ways to improve patient, physician and employee satisfaction. We believe that a focus on continuous improvement yields the best results for patients, reduces risk and liability, and creates value for the people and communities we serve.
 We have developed and implemented programs to support and monitor patient safety and quality of care that include:
  
• | Standardized data and benchmarks to monitor clinical outcomes, hospital performance and quality improvement efforts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recommended policies and procedures based on medical and scientific evidence;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training with evidence-based tools for improving patient safety and quality of care and patient, physician and employee satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging technology and information sharing around evidence-based clinical best practices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training programs for hospital management and clinical staff regarding regulatory and reporting requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implementation of specific leadership methods and error-prevention tools to create safer care environments for patients and staff.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have also expanded our network of outpatient services to create greater access and more convenience for our patients. Moreover, as conditions arising from the pandemic accelerated the need for telehealth appointments, we have significantly expanded our ability to provide remote care.
 We have operated a Patient Safety Organization, or PSO, since 2011. Our PSO is listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency, or HHS, for Healthcare Research and Quality. We believe our PSO has assisted, and will continue to assist us, in improving patient safety at our hospitals. The PSO has been recertified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through 2024.
 Industry Overview
 According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, national healthcare expenditures grew 9.7% in 2020 to $4.1 trillion, primarily due to a 36.0% increase in federal expenditures for healthcare that occurred largely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the spending growth was driven by federal financial assistance to healthcare providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, or PHSSEF, and Paycheck Protection Program loans, increased federal public health activity, and increased federal Medicaid funding. When spending associated with federal public health and other federal programs (including the PHSSEF and Paycheck Protection Program loans) is excluded, total national health expenditures increased 1.9% in 2020, a smaller increase than the projected 5.2%, largely due to decreased use of medical goods and services. The CMS projections of healthcare spending are constructed using a current-law framework. The most recent projections were published in March 2020, and therefore do not take into account the impacts of COVID-19 or the actual expenditures in 2020 or 2021. These projections indicate that total U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.6% for 2022 through 2028. CMS anticipates that total U.S. healthcare annual expenditures will reach nearly $6.2 trillion by 2028, accounting for approximately 19.7% of the total U.S. gross domestic product. 
 Hospital services, the market within the healthcare industry in which we primarily operate, is the largest single category of healthcare expenditures. In 2020, hospital care expenditures increased 6.4%, similar to the growth rate of 6.3% in 2019, and totaled nearly $1.3 trillion. The growth in 2020 reflected a substantial amount of funding from federal programs (including COVID-19 relief) and larger increases in Medicaid spending compared to prior years. CMS projects that the hospital services category will grow at an average of 6.0% annually from 2022 through 2028, reaching nearly $2.1 trillion by 2028.
 U.S. Hospital Industry. The U.S. hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public (government owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or for-profit institutions (investor owned). According to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 5,141 community hospitals in the U.S., which are not-for-profit owned, investor owned, or state or local government owned. Of these hospitals, approximately 35.1% are located in non-urban communities. We believe that a majority of these hospitals are owned by not-for-profit or governmental entities. These facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, OB/GYN and emergency services. In addition, hospitals offer other ancillary services, including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home care and outpatient surgery services.

Factors Affecting Performance. Among the many factors that can influence a hospital’s financial and operating performance are:
  
• | facility size and location;
--+----------------------------


• | facility ownership structure (e.g., tax-exempt or investor owned);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a facility’s ability to participate in GPOs, such as HealthTrust;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | facility payor mix;
--+--------------------


• | the terms of contracts with third-party payors, including managed care plans; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the extent of Medicaid expansion.
--+----------------------------------

 Patients needing the most complex care are more often served by the larger and/or more specialized urban hospitals. We believe opportunities exist in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals in order to expand the breadth of services offered in the non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in those markets and making them more attractive to managed care organizations.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 As a provider of healthcare services, we have been significantly affected by the public health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hospitals, medical clinics, medical personnel and employees have been actively caring for COVID-19 patients, and we have been working with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the communities we serve, including taking or supporting measures intended to limit the spread of the virus, protect our employees, and mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. For additional information regarding the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, as well as information regarding legislation enacted and other governmental actions taken by federal and state governments to assist healthcare providers in providing care during the pandemic and to provide financial relief to healthcare providers, see the discussion below under “COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Overview of Legislative Developments” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Hospital Industry Trends
 Demographic Trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2021, there were nearly 54 million Americans aged 65 or older in the U.S. comprising approximately 16.5% of the total U.S. population. By the year 2030, the number of Americans aged 65 or older is expected to climb to 73 million, or 20.6% of the total population. Due to the anticipated increasing life expectancy of Americans, the number of people aged 85 and older is also expected to increase from 6 million in 2016 to 9 million by the year 2030. This anticipated increase in life expectancy will increase demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for innovative, more sophisticated means of delivering those services. Hospitals, as the largest category of care in the healthcare market, will be among those impacted most directly by this increase in demand. Based on data compiled for us, the populations of the service areas where our hospitals are located grew 5.2% from 2016 to 2021 and are expected to grow by 4.0% from 2021 to 2026. The number of people aged 65 or older in these service areas grew by 19.8% from 2016 to 2021 and is expected to grow by 15.0% from 2021 to 2026. People aged 65 or older comprised 19.4% of the total population in our service areas in 2021, and they may comprise an estimated 21.5% of the total population in our service areas by 2026.
 Consolidation. In addition to our own acquisitions and dispositions in recent years, consolidation activity in the hospital industry, primarily through mergers and acquisitions involving both for-profit and not-for-profit hospital systems, is continuing. Reasons for this activity include:

• | ample supply of available capital;
--+-----------------------------------


• | valuation levels;
--+------------------


• | financial performance issues, including challenges associated with changes in reimbursement and collectability of self-pay revenue;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the community;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need and ability to recruit primary care physicians and specialists;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need to achieve general economies of scale and to gain access to standardized and centralized functions, including favorable supply agreements and access to malpractice coverage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes to healthcare payment models that emphasize cost-effective delivery of service and quality of outcomes for the entire episode of care; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory changes.
--+--------------------

The payor industry is also consolidating and acquiring health services providers in an effort to offer more expansive, competitive programs.
 Trends in Payment for Healthcare Services. As discussed in more detail in the Government Regulation section of this Form 10-K, growing financial and economic pressures on the healthcare industry have resulted in challenges to traditional reimbursement models. For example, value-based purchasing initiatives emphasize the cost-effective delivery of care and quality of outcomes. In addition, health insurance coverage models have evolved, with increased enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans and in high-deductible health plans. We may face greater risk of write-offs of uncollectible amounts from patients enrolled in high-deductible health plans.
 Shift to Outpatient Services. Because of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient healthcare facilities, the increase in the services that can be provided at these locations, and payor policies requiring or promoting treatment in outpatient settings, many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities. This trend has contributed to an increase in outpatient services while inhibiting the growth of inpatient admissions. Changes to Medicare policy affecting the reimbursement methodology for certain items and services provided by off-campus provider-based hospital departments have generally resulted in reduced payment rates for these hospital outpatient settings. In addition, CMS recently finalized a rule setting forth criteria for determining whether services or procedures should be removed from the Inpatient Only List, which is a list of procedures eligible to be reimbursed by Medicare only if performed in an inpatient setting. To the extent procedures become eligible to be reimbursed by Medicare if performed in outpatient settings, demand for outpatient services may increase in comparison to demand for inpatient services.

Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude loss (gain) from early extinguishment of debt, impairment and (gain) loss on sale of businesses, gain on sale of equity interests in Macon Healthcare, LLC, (income) expense related to government and other legal settlements and related costs, expense incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the settlement of certain professional liability claims for which the third-party insurers’ obligation to insure the Company against the underlying loss was being litigated along with income during the fourth quarter of 2021 associated with the settlement of such litigation for the recovery of amounts covered by such third-party insurance policies, expense related to employee termination benefits and other restructuring charges, expense from settlement and fair value adjustments on the contingent value right agreement liability related to the Health Management Associates, Inc., legal proceedings and related legal expenses, the impact of changes in estimate to increase the professional liability claims accrual recorded during the second quarter of 2019 (which estimate was further revised in the third quarter of 2019 based on updated actuarial analysis) with respect to claims incurred in 2016 and prior years, and expense related to the valuation allowance recorded in the second quarter of 2019 to reserve the outstanding balance of a promissory note received from the buyer in connection with the sale of two of the Company’s hospitals in 2017, as well as income from a reduction of the valuation allowance on the outstanding balance of a promissory note from the buyer of another hospital. As previously disclosed, during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred expenses in the amount of approximately $50 million related to the settlement of a professional liability claim for which the Company’s third-party insurer’s obligation to provide coverage to the Company in connection with the underlying loss was being litigated. Moreover, during the three months ended December 31, 2021, as referenced above, the Company recognized income in the amount of approximately $19 million, net of related legal fees, from the settlement of the aforementioned litigation with third-party insurers. The Company has included this adjustment in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2021, because the Company believes the income associated with such settlement is not reflective of the Company’s underlying results of operations in light of the intended purpose of Adjusted EBITDA in assessing the Company’s operational performance and comparing the Company’s performance between periods. The Company has from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of its subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions. The Company believes that it is useful to present Adjusted EBITDA because it adds back the portion of EBITDA attributable to these third-party interests. The Company reports Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company’s hospital operations and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Adjusted EBITDA is also used to evaluate the performance of the Company’s executive management team and is one of the primary metrics used in connection with determining short-term cash incentive compensation and the achievement of vesting criteria with respect to performance-based equity awards. In addition, management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing the Company’s consolidated results of operations and operational performance and in comparing the Company’s results of operations between periods. The Company believes it is useful to provide investors and other users of the Company’s financial statements this performance measure to align with how management assesses the Company’s results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA also is comparable to a similar metric called Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Company’s asset-based loan facility, or the ABL Facility, and the Company’s existing note indentures, which is a key component in the determination of the Company’s compliance with certain covenants under the ABL Facility and such note indentures (including the Company’s ability to service debt and incur capital expenditures), and is used to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the ABL Facility (although Adjusted EBITDA does not include all of the adjustments described in the ABL Facility). Adjusted EBITDA includes the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to hospitals that were divested during the course of such year, but in each case solely to the extent relating to the period prior to the consummation of the applicable divestiture. For further discussion of Consolidated EBITDA and how that measure is utilized in the calculation of covenants in the ABL Facility, see the Capital Resources section of Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance. The Company believes such adjustments are appropriate as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly 
 8


and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Additionally, this calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies.
 The following table reflects the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, to net income (loss) attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. stockholders as derived directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):

Sources of Revenue
 The following table presents the approximate percentages of net operating revenues by payor source for the periods indicated. The data for the periods presented are not strictly comparable due to the effect that hospital acquisitions and divestitures have had on these statistics. 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
Medicare | | 21.4 | % | | 23.9 | % | 25.2 | %
Medicaid | | 13.5 | | | 13.4 | | 13.2 | 
Managed Care and other third-party payors | | 64.2 | | | 62.9 | | 60.6 | 
Self-pay | | 0.9 | | | (0.2 | ) | 1.0 | 
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
As shown above, we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Included in Managed Care and other third-party payors is operating revenues from insurance companies with which we have insurance provider contracts, Medicare managed care, insurance companies for which we do not have insurance provider contracts, workers’ compensation carriers and non-patient service revenue, such as rental income and cafeteria sales. In the future, we generally expect the portion of revenues received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to increase over the long-term due to the general aging of the population and other factors, including health reform initiatives. There has been a trend toward increased enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid managed care, which may adversely affect our operating revenue. We may also be impacted by regulatory requirements imposed on 
 9


insurers, such as minimum medical-loss ratios and specific benefit requirements. Furthermore, in the normal course of business, managed care programs, insurance companies and employers actively negotiate the amounts paid to hospitals. Our relationships with payors may be impacted by price transparency initiatives and out-of-network billing restrictions, including those in the No Surprises Act, which took effect January 1, 2022 and is discussed further below. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing reimbursement arrangements or that third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services. 
 Net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost-based reimbursement and other payment methods. In addition, we are reimbursed by non-governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies. Amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental payors are generally less than our standard billing rates. We account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and our standard billing rates as contractual allowance adjustments, which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues. Final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties. We account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual allowance adjustments and report them in the periods that such adjustments become known. Contractual allowance adjustments related to final settlements and previous program reimbursement estimates impacted net operating revenues and net income (loss) by an insignificant amount in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
 The payment rates under the Medicare program for hospital inpatient and outpatient acute care services are based on prospective payment systems, which depend upon a patient’s diagnosis or the clinical complexity of services provided to a patient, among other factors. These rates are indexed for inflation annually, although increases have historically been less than actual inflation. 
 Payment rates under the Medicaid program vary by state. In addition to the base payment rates for specific claims for services rendered to Medicaid enrollees, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs to make separate payments that are not specifically tied to an individual’s care, some of which offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and are funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the providers. The programs are generally authorized for a specified period of time and require CMS’s approval to be extended. We are unable to predict whether or on what terms CMS will extend the supplemental programs in the states in which we operate. Under these supplemental programs, we recognize revenue and related expenses in the period in which amounts are estimable and payment is reasonably assured. Reimbursement under these programs is reflected in net operating revenues and included as Medicaid revenue in the table above, and fees, taxes or other program related costs are reflected in other operating expenses.
 As of December 31, 2021, Indiana, Florida, Texas and Alabama represented our only areas of significant geographic concentration. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Indiana, as a percentage of consolidated net operating revenues, were 16.4% in 2021, 15.0% in 2020 and 13.7% in 2019. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Florida, as a percentage of consolidated net operating revenues, were 12.2% in 2021 and 13.0% in 2020 and 14.3% in 2019. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Texas, as a percentage of consolidated net operating revenues, were 11.0% in 2021 and 12.2% in both 2020 and 2019. Net operating revenues generated by our hospitals in Alabama, as a percentage of consolidated net operating revenues, were 13.0% in 2021, 12.1% in 2020 and 10.6% in 2019.
 Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for hospital services provided. Charges and payment rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of service performed and the geographic location of the hospital. In recent years, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue received from outpatient services. We attribute this increase to:
  
• | advances in technology, which have permitted us to provide more services on an outpatient basis and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pressure from Medicare and Medicaid programs, insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce the length and number of inpatient hospital stays and to reduce costs by providing services on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Healthcare facility operations are also subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in colder weather months. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an impact on patient behaviors and patient volumes that has resulted in, and may continue to result in, temporary changes in typical seasonal fluctuations of our business.

Government Regulation
 Overview. Participants in the healthcare industry are required to comply with extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, our hospitals could lose their licenses and we could lose our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. These legal and regulatory standards address, among other issues, licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; the necessity and adequacy of medical care; quality of medical equipment and services; qualifications of medical and support personnel; operating policies and procedures; screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions; billing and coding for services; handling overpayments; classifications of levels of care provided; preparing and filing cost reports; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients; maintenance of adequate records; hospital use; rate-setting; building codes; environmental protection; privacy and security; interoperability and refraining from information blocking; debt collection; balance billing and billing for out-of-network services; and communications with patients and consumers. 
 Hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities to determine their compliance with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing and certification. All of our hospitals are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, most of our hospitals are accredited by The Joint Commission. This accreditation indicates that a hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Government regulations may change. If that happens, we may have to make changes to our facilities, equipment, personnel and services so that our hospitals remain certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in these programs. We believe that our hospitals are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local regulations and standards. We cannot be certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation.
 Healthcare Reform. The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that have impacted access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act increased health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. The Affordable Care Act also made a number of changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, such as a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update and reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, payments. However, reductions to Medicaid DSH payments have been delayed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, or the CAA, through 2023 (to begin in federal fiscal year 2024).
 The Affordable Care Act has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes. For example, effective January 1, 2019, the financial penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that most individuals enroll in a health insurance plan was effectively eliminated. This change resulted in legal challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and validity of the Affordable Care Act as a whole. However, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs lacked standing, allowing the law to remain in place. Nonetheless, the elimination of the individual mandate penalty and other changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. Some states have imposed individual health insurance mandates, and other states have explored or offer public health insurance options.
 The current presidential administration has indicated that it generally intends to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid programs. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health insurance coverage. In a final rule published in September 2021, HHS extended the annual open enrollment period for coverage through federal marketplaces and granted state exchanges flexibility to lengthen their open enrollment periods.
 Of critical importance to us is the potential impact of any changes specific to the Medicaid program, including the funding and expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation or agency initiatives. Historically, the states with the greatest reductions in the number of uninsured adult residents have expanded Medicaid. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions, but could ultimately decide to expand their programs at a later date. Of the 16 states in which we operated hospitals as of December 31, 2021, nine states have taken action to expand their Medicaid programs. At this time, the other seven states have not, including Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Texas, where we operated a significant number of hospitals as of December 31, 2021. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment conditions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards.
There is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the Affordable Care Act due to the potential for continued changes to the law’s implementation and its interpretation by government agencies and courts. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential 
 11


impact of other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels. Some reforms may have a positive impact on our business, while others may increase our operating costs, adversely impact the reimbursement we receive, or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored health insurance coverage, including single-payor models, and some states have implemented or are considering public health insurance options. Legislative and executive branch efforts related to healthcare reform could result in increased prices for consumers purchasing health insurance coverage, or destabilize insurance markets, among other effects. Some current initiatives, requirements and proposals, including requirements aimed at price transparency and out-of-network charges, may impact prices, our competitive position, and our relationships with insurers and patients. For example, the No Surprises Act requires providers to send an insured patient’s health plan a good faith estimate of expected charges, including billing and diagnostic codes, prior to when the patient is scheduled to receive the item or service. HHS is deferring enforcement of this requirement until it issues additional regulations.
Fraud and Abuse Laws. Participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to comply substantially with the requirements for participating in the programs, the hospital’s participation may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare program if it engages in any of the following acts:

• | making claims to Medicare for services not provided or misrepresenting actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | paying money to induce the referral of patients where services are reimbursable under a federal health program; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | paying money to limit or reduce the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including private healthcare plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. Additionally, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully falsifies or conceals a material fact or makes any material false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery or payment of healthcare services by a healthcare benefit plan is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both.
 A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits some business practices and relationships under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These practices include the payment, receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration of any kind in exchange for items or services that are reimbursed under a federal healthcare program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and have held that there is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals.
 The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs. As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG also publishes regulations outlining activities and business relationships that would be deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. These regulations are known as “safe harbor” regulations. The failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
 The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as potential violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute:
  
• | payment of any incentive by the hospital when a physician refers a patient to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment for physicians in facilities usually located close to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing, or other staff services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | free training for a physician’s office staff, including management and laboratory techniques (but excluding compliance training);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | guarantees which provide that, if the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | low-interest or interest-free loans or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences or an honorarium for speaker events;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of services which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | physician-owned entities (often referred to as physician-owned distributorships, or PODS) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in a number of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We also have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans. Although we strive to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, taking into account available guidance including the “safe harbor” regulations, including revised regulations issued in November 2020, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine otherwise. If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and/or exclusion from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs. Civil monetary penalties increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index.
 The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements. These types of referrals are commonly known as “self referrals.” Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties that are increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibition. One exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if the entity is located in a rural area, as defined in the statute. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, CMS has issued regulations that interpret the Stark Law. In November 2020 and November 2021, CMS finalized changes to the Stark Law implementing regulations intended to modernize and clarify the requirements for complying with the Stark Law.
 Another exception to the Stark Law, known as the “whole hospital” exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital, and the hospital meets certain “grandfathering” requirements imposed by the Affordable Care Act. These requirements prohibit physicians from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital and restrict the ability of physician-owned hospitals from expanding the capacity of their aggregate licensed beds, operating rooms and procedure rooms, beyond the ownership percentage and capacities in place in 2010. The whole hospital exception also contains additional public disclosure requirements. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds debt, stock or other types of investment in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly-traded securities that meet certain conditions.
 In addition to the restrictions and disclosure requirements applicable to physician-owned hospitals under the Stark Law, CMS regulations require physician-owned hospitals and their physician owners to disclose certain ownership information to patients. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request. Additionally, each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospital’s medical staff must agree, as a condition of continued medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their (or an immediate family member’s) ownership interest in the hospital. If a hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could lose its Medicare provider agreement and be unable to participate in Medicare.
 Evolving interpretations of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations could affect many of the arrangements entered into by each of our hospitals. In addition, law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, the courts and Congress have in recent years increased scrutiny of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to improperly pay for patient referrals and/or other business. Investigators have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources.
 Many states in which we operate have also adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals, similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or that otherwise prohibit fraud and abuse activities. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. Little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
 13


Our operations could be adversely affected by the failure of our arrangements to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, billing laws and regulations, current state laws or other legislation or regulations in these areas adopted in the future. We are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level in any of these areas will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or how they may affect our operations. We are continuing to enter into new financial arrangements with physicians and other providers in a manner structured to comply in all material respects with these laws. We strive to comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws. We cannot assure you, however, that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation.
 Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws. Another significant enforcement mechanism used within the healthcare industry is the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which can be used to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for service not provided and submitting false cost reports. The FCA covers payments involving federal funds in connection with the health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, if those payments involve any federal funds. Liability under the FCA often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA broadly defines the term “knowingly.” Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute “knowingly” submitting a false claim and result in liability. Among the many other potential bases for liability under the FCA is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. Submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government and courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA.
 When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial civil penalties for each separate false claim. These civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe calculation of damages. The FCA also contains “qui tam,” or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. If the government intervenes in the action and prevails, the party filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors and agents providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws.
 A number of states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the FCA. From time to time, companies in the healthcare industry, including ours, may be subject to actions under the FCA or similar state laws.
 Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee-Splitting. Some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations, from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit direct or indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities. Possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician’s license, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. These laws vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We structure our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law. However, we cannot provide assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we, or transactions in which we are involved, are in violation of these laws. These laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations.
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, imposes requirements as to the care that must be provided to anyone who comes to facilities providing emergency medical services seeking care before they may be transferred to another facility or otherwise denied care. Sanctions for failing to fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil money penalties, which are increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, the law creates private civil remedies that enable an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief. A medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital’s violation of the law also has a similar right. Although we believe that our practices are in compliance with the law, we can give no assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law will not assert we are in violation of this law.

Conversion Legislation. Many states, including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals, have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities. In other states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste. These legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the not-for-profit seller. While these reviews and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition, we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing the acquisition process. There can be no assurance, however, that future actions on the state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals. If these activities are widespread, they could limit our ability to acquire hospitals.
 Antitrust Laws. The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.
 Certificates of Need. The construction of new facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, significant capital expenditures and the addition of new services at our facilities may be subject to state laws that require prior approval by state regulatory agencies. These certificate of need, or CON, laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need and give approval prior to the construction or acquisition of facilities, significant capital expenditure or the addition of new services. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 65 hospitals in 12 states that have adopted CON laws. If we fail to obtain necessary state approval, we will not be able to expand our facilities, complete acquisitions or significant capital expenditures or add new services in these states. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a provider’s licenses.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HHS has established electronic data transmission standards and code sets that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically and has issued operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. HIPAA also requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier.
 As required by HIPAA, HHS has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information and require covered entities, including health plans and most healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically maintained or transmitted. Business associates (entities that handle identifiable health-related information on behalf of covered entities) are subject to direct liability for violation of applicable provisions of the regulations. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. We have developed and utilize a HIPAA compliance plan as part of our effort to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements. The privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards.
 Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.
 Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS is required to perform compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We are also subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties and subject us to additional privacy and security restrictions. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement 
 15


actions in response to data breaches. In addition, various states have enacted, and other states are considering, new laws and regulations concerning the privacy and security of consumer and other personal information. To the extent we are subject to such requirements, these laws and regulations often have far-reaching effects, are subject to amendments and changing requirements and updates to regulators’ enforcement priorities, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply and may subject our business to a risk of increased potential liability. These laws and regulations often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, which may increase the likelihood or impact of data breach litigation.
 Payment
 Medicare. Medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease.
 Payments for inpatient acute hospital services are generally made pursuant to a prospective payment system, or PPS. Under the inpatient PPS, our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount for each hospital discharge based on the patient’s diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a Medicare severity diagnosis-related group, commonly known as an “MS-DRG,” based upon the patient’s condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. The MS-DRGs are severity-adjusted to account for the severity of each patient’s condition and expected resource consumption. Each MS-DRG has a payment weight assigned to it that is based on the average resources used to treat Medicare patients in that MS-DRG. MS-DRG payments are based on national averages and not on charges or costs specific to a hospital. Medicare sets discharge base rates (standardization payment amounts), which are adjusted according to the MS-DRG relative weights and geographic factors. In addition, hospitals may qualify for an “outlier” payment when a patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold.
 The MS-DRG payment rates for inpatient acute services are adjusted by an update factor on October 1 of each year, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG payment rates, known as the “market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. MS-DRG payment rates were increased by the “market basket index” update of 2.4% and 2.7% for each of federal fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, subject to certain adjustments. For federal fiscal year 2021, the market basket update was adjusted by the following percentage points: a positive 0.5 adjustment in accordance with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, and a 0.0 productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2022, the market basket was adjusted by the following percentage points: a positive 0.5 adjustment in accordance with MACRA and a 0.7 reduction for the productivity adjustment. A reduction of 25% of the market basket update occurs if patient quality data is not submitted, and a reduction of 75% of the market basket update occurs for hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health records, or EHR, technology without receiving a hardship exception. Additional adjustments may apply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors.
 The MS-DRG payment rates are also adjusted to promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. First, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under CMS’s Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, while hospitals that do not satisfy certain quality performance standards receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. CMS withholds 2% of participating hospitals’ Medicare payments and uses the total amount collected to fund payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality and resource use measures. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospital’s own past performance. Second, hospitals experiencing “excess readmissions” within 30 days from the patient’s date of discharge following treatment for conditions or procedures designated by CMS receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions or procedures subject to the readmission standard. The payment reduction is determined by assessing that hospital’s readmissions relative to hospitals with similar proportions of dual-eligible patients. Third, the bottom quartile of hospitals based on the national risk-adjusted hospital acquired condition, or HAC, rates in the previous year have their total inpatient operating Medicare payments reduced by 1%. HHS has indicated that it will increase its efforts to promote, develop and use alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, and bundled payment arrangements.
 In addition, hospitals may qualify for Medicare DSH payment adjustments when their percentage of low-income patients exceeds specified regulatory thresholds. A majority of our hospitals qualify to receive these adjustments. CMS also distributes an additional payment to each DSH hospital for its proportion of uncompensated care costs relative to the uncompensated care amount of other DSH hospitals. The uncompensated care amount is hospital-specific and generally includes charity care and non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt. The Medicare DSH adjustments and uncompensated care payments as a percentage of net operating revenues were 0.91% and 1.11% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 We also receive Medicare reimbursement for hospital outpatient services through a PPS. Services paid under the hospital outpatient PPS are grouped into ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs. Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. APC payment rates are generally determined by applying a conversion factor, which CMS updates annually using a market basket. For calendar year 2021, CMS estimated an increase in hospital outpatient PPS payments of 2.4%. This reflected 
 16


a market basket increase of 2.4%, with a 0.0 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2022, CMS estimated an increase in hospital outpatient PPS payments of 2.0%, reflecting a market basket increase of 2.7%, with a negative 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment. A 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update applies to hospitals that do not submit required patient quality data. We are complying with this data submission requirement.
 In calendar year 2019, CMS began a two-year phase-in of an expanded site-neutral payment policy for off-campus provider-based departments paid under the outpatient PPS. Under the policy, all off-campus provider-based departments are paid the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, -equivalent rate for clinic visits, which is generally lower than the outpatient PPS rate. Before the expanded policy, the MPFS-equivalent rate did not apply to “excepted” provider-based departments. In September 2019, a federal judge invalidated the expansion of the site-neutral payment policy for calendar year 2019. CMS appealed this decision and prevailed. However, pending its appeal, CMS had begun reprocessing the 2019 claims paid at the lower rates. As a result of its successful appeal, CMS indicated it would begin, by November 1, 2021, to reprocess the 2019 claims provided at excepted provider-based departments so that they are paid at the same rate as non-excepted provider-based departments for those services under the MPFS. For calendar year 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing year two of the policy phase-in. For calendar year 2021 and beyond, CMS is continuing the payment policy. The MPFS-equivalent rate for calendar year 2022 is approximately 40% of the outpatient PPS rate. 
 CMS uses fee schedules to pay for physician services, physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, freestanding surgery center services, and certain other items and services. Under the MPFS, CMS has assigned a national relative value unit, or RVU, to most medical procedures and services that reflects the resources required to provide the services relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of the time and intensity of work required, overhead expense attributable to the service, and malpractice insurance expense. These elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. To determine the payment rate for a particular service, the sum of the geographically adjusted RVUs is multiplied by a conversion factor. For calendar year 2022, CMS decreased the conversion factor by approximately 3.71%, reflecting a budget neutrality adjustment to account for changes in RVUs and the expiration of a 3.75% temporary payment increase that Congress approved for calendar year 2021 through the CAA. However, Congress approved a 3.0% payment increase for calendar year 2022, which will partially offset this reduction.
 CMS requires physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians to participate in one of two tracks under the Quality Payment Program, or QPP, which is a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Under both tracks, performance data collected each performance year affects Medicare payments two years later. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as QPP evolves. Under the Advanced Alternative Payment Model, or Advanced APM, track, incentive payments are available based on participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a Medicare incentive payment and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, if the provider has sufficient participation in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track, under which physicians will receive performance-based payment incentives or payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHRs.
 Medicaid. Medicaid is a program funded jointly by state and federal governments, and administered by the states, that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying low-income individuals. Medicaid enrollment has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the federal government has made available enhanced federal Medicaid funding in response to the pandemic. 
 Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. In addition to the base payment rates for specific claims for services rendered to Medicaid enrollees, states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs to make separate payments that are not specifically tied to an individual’s care. Supplemental payments may be in the form of Medicaid DSH payments, which are intended to offset hospitals’ uncompensated care costs. Medicaid DSH payments as a percentage of our net operating revenues were 0.54% and 0.65% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation provide for reductions to the Medicaid DSH program, but Congress has delayed the implementation of these reductions. Under current law, Medicaid DSH payments will be reduced by $8 billion per year in each of federal fiscal years 2024 through 2027. Supplemental payments may also be in the form of non-DSH payments, such as upper payment limit payments, which are intended to address the difference between Medicaid fee-for-service payments and Medicare reimbursement rates. These supplemental reimbursement programs are designed with input from CMS. The programs are generally authorized for a specified period of time and require CMS’s approval to be extended. CMS is considering changes to both types of programs, and we are unable to predict whether or on what terms CMS will extend the supplemental programs in the states in which we operate.
 The federal government and many states are using or considering various strategies to reduce Medicaid expenditures, outside of the pandemic response. In response to budgetary pressures, certain states in which we operate have adopted broad taxes on healthcare providers to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid programs. In addition, many states currently operate, or have applied to CMS to operate, Medicaid programs under waivers to standard Medicaid program requirements. For example, the Texas Transformation and Quality Improvement Program, or the Texas Waiver Program, is operated under a waiver granted under Section 1115 of the Social 
 17


Security Act. The program provides funding for uncompensated care and supports several delivery system reform initiatives. However, there is currently uncertainty regarding the duration of the Texas Waiver Program. Although the previous presidential administration approved a 10-year extension of the program, through September 2030, CMS rescinded this extension in April 2021. The Texas Attorney General filed a lawsuit challenging the rescission and, in August 2021, a federal district judge granted a preliminary injunction temporarily reinstating the extension. While the lawsuit is pending, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has re-submitted its application to extend the Texas Waiver Program.
 There is uncertainty in other states as well. The prior presidential administration increased state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including by allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement or to use a block grant funding structure. However, the current presidential administration issued an executive order directing agencies to re-examine measures that reduce health insurance coverage or undermine Medicaid programs, and the administration has rescinded approvals of waivers for work and community engagement requirements.
TRICARE. TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s healthcare program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE generally reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.
 Annual Cost Reports. Hospitals participating in the Medicare and some Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. 
 Commercial Insurance and Managed Care Companies. Our hospitals provide services to individuals covered by private healthcare insurance or by health plans administered by managed care companies. These payors pay our hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospital’s established charges and the coverage provided in the insurance policy. Payors try to limit their costs by negotiating with hospitals and other healthcare providers for discounts to established charges. Commercial insurers and managed care companies also seek to reduce payments to hospitals by establishing payment rules that in effect re-characterize the services ordered by physicians. For example, some payors vigorously review each patient’s length of stay in the hospital and recharacterize as outpatient all inpatient stays of less than a particular duration (e.g., 24 hours). Similarly, some payors have prior authorization requirements designed to shift certain procedures to outpatient settings, where payment rates are typically lower. Reductions in payments for services provided by our hospitals to individuals covered by these payors could adversely affect us.
 Under the Managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide members with Medicare benefits. The plans may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and cost-sharing obligations. Similarly, managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with private entities to handle program responsibilities like care management and claims adjudication. Enrollment in Managed Medicare and managed Medicaid programs has increased in recent years as the federal and state governments seek to control healthcare costs.
 Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, in 12 jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. Chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, and we chose to do so. However, CMS has not converted all of our hospitals to one MAC and currently does not have an established date to accomplish the conversion. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow.
 Medicare and Medicaid Integrity. CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations, or QIOs, for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC, program, CMS contracts with RACs nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis and based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year.
 18


The RAC program’s scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS contracts with Unified Program Integrity Contractors, or UPICs, to perform audits, investigations and other integrity activities. Working across five geographic jurisdictions, UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 We maintain policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2020 was nearly four years. To ease the backlog of appeals, HHS has taken steps to streamline the process and improve efficiency, such as offering various settlement initiatives. Nevertheless, we may experience significant delays in appealing any RAC payment denials. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 Accountable Care Organizations. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs have gained traction in both the public and private sectors. An ACO is a network of providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. The Medicare Shared Savings Program seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers and exceptions are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. 
 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or CMS Innovation Center, is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. In October 2021, the CMS Innovation Center published an outline of its strategy for the next decade, noting the need to accelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the CMS Innovation Center aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and most Medicaid beneficiaries in a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care. CMS also indicated it will streamline its payment model portfolio and consider how to ensure broad provider participation, including by implementing more mandatory models.
 Bundled Payment Initiatives. Providers participating in bundled payment initiatives accept accountability for costs and quality of care by agreeing to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a certain amount, bundled payment models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. The CMS Innovation Center has implemented bundled payment models, including the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced, or BPCI Advanced, initiative, which is expected to run through December 2023. We are participating in BPCI Advanced initiatives in five of our markets. Generally, participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, but CMS currently requires hospitals in selected markets to participate in bundled payment initiatives for specific orthopedic procedures and end-stage renal disease treatment, and a mandatory radiation oncology bundled payment model is expected to begin January 1, 2023. In its 2021 strategy refresh, the CMS Innovation Center signaled its intent to increase provider participation through implementation of more mandatory models. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including models that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common with both governmental and non-governmental payors.
 Supply Contracts
 We purchase items, primarily medical supplies, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, under an agreement with HealthTrust, a GPO in which we are a noncontrolling partner. The current term of this agreement expires in December 2022, with automatic renewal terms of one year unless either party terminates by giving notice of non-renewal. As of December 31, 2021, we had a 17.5% ownership interest in HealthTrust. By participating in this organization, we are able to procure items at competitively priced rates for our hospitals. There can be no assurance that our arrangement with HealthTrust will continue to provide the discounts that we have historically received.
Competition
 The hospital industry is highly competitive. The competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers, including urgent care centers and other outpatient providers, for patients has intensified as patients have become more conscious of rising costs and quality of care in their healthcare decision-making process. The majority of our hospitals are located in generally larger non-urban service areas in which we believe we are the primary, if not the sole, provider of general acute care health services. Those hospitals in non-
 19


urban service areas may face limited or no direct competition because there are no other hospitals in their primary service areas. However, these hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area, including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in those service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons, including the need for services we do not offer, payor networks that exclude our providers, or physician referrals. Patients who are required to seek services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for services we do provide. Our other hospitals, in selected urban service areas, may face competition from hospitals that are more established than our hospitals. Some of our competitors offer services, including extensive medical research and medical education programs, that are not offered by our facilities. In addition, in certain markets where we operate, there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at our hospitals. We also face competition from other specialized care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers. Some competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, and participating in ACOs, or other clinical integration models. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may increase this competition. We believe that we will continue to face increased competition in outpatient service models that become more integrated through acquisitions or partnerships between physicians, specialized care providers, and managed care payors.
 In most markets in which we are not the sole provider of general acute care health services, our primary competitor is a municipal or not-for-profit hospital. These hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding general and capital expenditures and offering services more specialized than those available at our hospitals.
 The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital’s staff is an important factor in a hospital’s competitive position. Physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed. Admitting physicians may be on the medical staffs of other hospitals in addition to those of our hospitals. We attempt to attract our physicians’ patients to our hospitals by offering quality services and facilities, convenient locations and state-of-the-art equipment. 
 Trends towards transparency and value-based purchasing may impact our competitive position and patient volumes. CMS publicizes on its Care Compare website data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. The quality measures that must be reported by providers, some of which impact reimbursement under value-based purchasing initiatives, continue to evolve. In addition, hospitals are required to publish online a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including gross charges, discounted cash prices and payor-specific and de-identified negotiated charges, in a publicly accessible online file. Hospitals are also required to publish a consumer-friendly list of standard charges for certain “shoppable” services (i.e., services that can be scheduled by a patient in advance) and any associated ancillary services or, alternatively, maintain an online price estimator tool. In addition, the No Surprises Act, which took effect January 1, 2022, requires providers to send to an insured patient’s health plan good faith estimates of the expected charges for scheduled items or services, including billing and diagnostic codes, prior to the scheduled date of the items or services. The estimate must cover any item or service that is reasonably expected to be provided together with the primary items or services, including those that may be provided by other providers. If a patient is uninsured, the notice must go to the patient. If the actual charges to an uninsured (or self-pay) patient are substantially higher than the estimate, the patient may invoke a dispute resolution process established by regulation to challenge the higher amount. HHS is deferring enforcement of certain requirements of the No Surprises Act related to estimates for insured patients. Among other consumer protections, the No Surprises Act also prohibits providers from charging patients an amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for emergency services rendered by out-of-network providers and certain non-emergency services rendered by out-of-network providers at certain in-network facilities, including hospitals. HHS has established a dispute resolution process for out-of-network providers and health plans to resolve payment disagreements when surprise billing protections apply.
 Compliance Program
 We take an operations team approach to compliance and utilize corporate experts for program design efforts and facility leaders for employee-level implementation. We believe compliance is another area that demonstrates our utilization of standardization and centralization techniques and initiatives which yield efficiencies and consistency throughout our facilities. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on individual employee actions as well as company operations. Our approach focuses on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business.
 Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1997. Currently, the program’s elements include leadership, management and oversight at the highest levels, a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the program’s policies.
 20


The compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Included within these functional areas are materials and activities for business sub-units, including laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency, surgery, observation, home care, skilled nursing and clinics. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, emergency department treatment and transfer requirements and other patient disposition issues, are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements and review and audit. Another focus of the program is the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security.
 We have a Code of Conduct which applies to all directors, officers, employees and consultants, and a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and business associates who work in the accounting, financial reporting and asset management areas of our Company. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.chs.net/company-overview/code-of-conduct.
 Corporate Integrity Agreement
 On August 4, 2014, we announced that we had entered into a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of our affiliated hospitals. In addition to the amounts paid in the settlement, we executed a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, with the OIG that has been incorporated into our existing and comprehensive compliance program.
 On September 25, 2018, we announced a global resolution and settlement agreements ending the U.S. Department of Justice investigation into certain conduct of Health Management Associates, Inc., or HMA, and its affiliated entities and settling certain qui tam lawsuits that were initiated and pending, and known to us, before our acquisition by merger of HMA in 2014. Under this settlement, we made payments totaling $266 million, including interest, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Additionally, under the terms of the global settlement, our existing CIA was amended and extended. The extension began immediately and effectively added two years to the existing CIA, with the amended CIA running through September 2021. For additional information regarding the terms of the CIA, as amended, see pages 20 through 21 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed on February 18, 2021.
 The amended CIA expired in September 2021. However, we are still subject to final audit and reporting requirements under the terms of the CIA. In connection with these final audit and reporting requirements, it remains possible that we will become subject to further action by the OIG which could include the imposition of civil monetary penalties and/or the extension of the term of the CIA. 
 Human Capital
 Overview
 At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 66,000 employees, including approximately 15,000 part-time employees. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2021, certain employees at six of our hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is possible that union organizing efforts will take place at additional hospitals in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. 
 Our industry is facing unprecedented workforce challenges and this has become a significant operating issue for healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. An area that has been particularly challenging for providers is registered nurse, or RN, recruitment and retention.  We have had a centralized clinical recruiting function in place for a limited number of our markets since 2018. In early 2021, we made the decision to expand this focused recruiting resource and expect that this will be in place for all of our affiliated hospitals by early 2022. For those hospitals already supported by this internal centralized RN recruiting team, we have seen an increase in clinical position hires and a decreased time-to-fill for those key patient care roles. We have also engaged with a recruitment process outsource vendor in certain markets having additional staffing needs while we have been building our internal centralized RN recruiting team. In addition to these efforts, we have been working to bring international RNs through the visa process to our hospitals. We believe that these efforts will aid in our ability to take patient transfer requests, shorten emergency department wait times and lessen dependency on high cost contract labor.

Due to the challenges above and other factors, our hospitals and other healthcare facilities, like many other healthcare providers, have experienced rising labor costs. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. In some of our markets, employers across various industries have increased their minimum wage, which has created more competition for this sector of employees. As a result of these and other factors, our labor costs could continue to increase. Moreover, potential changes to federal labor laws and regulations, including those supported by the current presidential administration, could increase the likelihood of employee unionization activity and the ability of employees to unionize. The extent of unionization may affect labor costs in the future. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.
 We believe that our employees are vital contributors to our success, and we devote significant resources to recruit, retain and develop our workforce. Certain areas of focus in this regard are summarized below. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
     We believe that a diverse workforce is a catalyst for positive and consistent patient outcomes and high quality care. With inclusion as our strategy, diversity and equity are the outcomes we expect. Our objective is to recruit and retain a diverse population of employees with respect to their experiences, education, socioeconomic status, race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability, culture, sexual orientation and gender identity or expression that are reflective of the communities we serve. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our employees were women and approximately 25% were people of color.
       As we strive to deepen our culture of inclusion, our goal is to strengthen our individual and collective cultural competence through both formal training and development programs and by informally sharing lived experiences and relating to one another. We are committed to building a diverse talent pipeline through a variety of venues and programs such as internships, residencies, mentorship programs and by partnering with diverse professional organizations. A Diversity Leadership Committee was formed in 2021 and various actions have been taken with respect to many diversity, equity and inclusion objectives such as retaining and developing high potential employees, improving patient experience and outcomes and increasing supplier diversity. We intend to leverage data to inform and measure the effectiveness of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts over time.
 Training and Talent Development
 The delivery of high quality patient care is predicated on proper education and continued training. We provide a wide range of development programs and resources to support our employees, including temporary and contract personnel. In this regard, our talent development strategy is facilitated through our Advanced Learning Center platform, or ALC, a web-based portal, which provides employees and contractors access to computer based training courses as well as instructor-led classes. Our ALC provides training in many areas, including clinical, compliance, information technology, employee development, health information management, human resources, workplace safety and security, as well as hands-on resuscitation skills training. We offer continuing education credits for many of these disciplines. We are committed to continue to offer a quality library of training courses, which, at present, consists of approximately 2,700 courses published companywide, with a significant number of additional courses published at local facility levels.
 The quality of our training is assured through a robust annual course review process. Each course is reviewed by the author or subject matter expert for current accuracy of content, relevancy and utilization.  Updates are made based on current standards as well as feedback from individuals who complete the courses. Under the direction of our senior leadership, some courses are assigned to learners based on their role in our organization. The vast majority of the library is available for self-enrollment by our employees at no additional cost to the learner.

We also provide a wide range of other development programs and resources, including a tuition reimbursement program; nursing partnerships with education institutions which offer educational pathways to those desiring to become professional nurses; an executive development program, which identifies and develops qualified personnel for leadership-level positions at our healthcare facilities; our Community Leadership Excellence and Development Series, or LEADS, which is a proprietary training program for directors, managers and supervisors at our hospitals; and residency training programs. Moreover, we have provided mental health support for our personnel struggling with the significant emotional impact of caring for patients during the pandemic.
 Employee Safety
       The safety of our employees is of the utmost importance and is key to the continuous delivery of high quality patient care. We strive to protect our employees through continued communication, data analysis, equipment evaluation and education. Leadership methods which employ a “safety-first” mindset are practiced in our hospitals including in safety huddles performed regularly by personnel at our hospitals. Each huddle consists of a three-part agenda: (1) a look back at any significant safety or quality issues in the past 24 hours, (2) a look ahead to any anticipated safety or quality issues in the next 24 hours, and (3) a follow-up on safety critical issues requiring a rapid response.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations that govern, among other things, our disposal of medical waste, as well as our use, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials. In addition, we could be affected by climate change to the extent that climate change results in severe weather conditions or other disruptions impacting the communities in which our facilities are located or adversely impacts general economic conditions, including in communities in which our facilities are located. At the current time, our compliance with environmental legal requirements, including legal requirements relating to climate change, does not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial results or operations. However, it is possible that developments may arise in the future as a result of climate change or other environmental developments that we are unable to currently predict.
 We recognize the environment is an exhaustible resource and the importance of using the environment and its resources responsibly. We have established goals and taken actions with respect to various sustainability matters with a focus on the reduction of our carbon footprint, water and energy usage and material waste. For additional information about our ongoing environmental sustainability actions and practices, refer to our 2021 Environmental Sustainability Report, which is available in the Company Overview-Sustainability section of our website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information on our website, including our 2021 Environmental Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
 Professional Liability Claims
 As part of our business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To cover claims arising out of the operations of hospitals, we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance on a claims made basis in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured, in amounts we believe to be sufficient for our operations. We also maintain umbrella liability coverage for claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by our other insurance policies. However, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us or may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. For a further discussion of our insurance coverage, see our discussion of professional liability claims in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
