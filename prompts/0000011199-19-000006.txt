ITEM 1 — BUSINESS

Bemis Company, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the “Registrant” or “Company”), continues a business formed in 1858.  We were incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company with the name changed to Bemis Company, Inc. in 1965.  We are a global manufacturer of packaging products. 

Our long-term strategic objectives are to accelerate growth, focus innovation, and continuously improve. During 2017, we launched Agility, our multi-year, three-pronged approach to fix, strengthen, and grow our business. Our vision is: passionate commitment to the growth and success of our customers will make Bemis the clear choice for inspired packaging solutions.
The majority of our products are sold to customers in the food industry.  Other customers include companies in the following types of businesses: chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, industrial, and other consumer goods. Further information about our operations in our business segments and geographic areas is available in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,700 employees worldwide. Approximately 7,800 of these employees were in the U.S., with 39 percent of the 5,550 hourly production employees covered by collective bargaining agreements involving six different unions. Of the approximately 7,900 employees who were outside the U.S., over half of the hourly production employees and some of the salaried workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements and are represented by numerous unions. 

Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions.  We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders.  Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate.  The business of each of the reportable segments is not seasonal to any material extent.

We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment.  We also have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries.  Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage.  However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results as a whole or those of any of our segments. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets.
 Our business activities are organized around our three reportable business segments, U.S. Packaging (66 percent of 2018 net sales), Latin America Packaging (15 percent) and Rest of World Packaging (19 percent). A summary of our business activities reported by our three reportable business segments follows. 
Definitive Transaction Agreement with Amcor
On August 6, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors, along with the Board of Directors of Amcor Limited (“Amcor”), unanimously approved a definitive agreement (the "Agreement”) under which Bemis will combine with Amcor in an all-stock combination (the "Merger”).
The Merger will be effected at a fixed exchange ratio of 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of our stock, resulting in Amcor and Bemis shareholders owning approximately 71% and 29% of the combined company, respectively. Closing of the Merger is conditional upon the receipt of regulatory approvals, approval by both Amcor and Bemis shareholders, and satisfaction of other customary conditions. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing, we expect the Merger to close in the second quarter of calendar year 2019. 
U.S. Packaging Segment
The U.S. Packaging segment represents all food, consumer, and industrial products packaging-related manufacturing operations located in the United States. This segment manufactures multilayer polymer, blown and cast film structures which are then converted to produce packaging for processed and fresh meat, dairy, liquids, frozen foods, cereals, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, pet food, bakery, lawn and garden, tissue, fresh produce, personal care and hygiene, and agribusiness.

Latin America Packaging Segment
The Latin America Packaging segment includes all food and non-food packaging-related manufacturing operations located in Latin America. This segment manufactures multilayer polymer, blown and cast film structures to produce packaging sold for a variety of food, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, and industrial applications. Additional products include injection molded and thermoformed plastic. These packaging solutions are used for a variety of applications including processed and fresh meat, dairy, liquids, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, bakery, tissue, fresh produce, personal care and hygiene, disposable diapers, pet food, pharmaceutical, and medical devices.
Rest of World Packaging Segement
The Rest of World Packaging segment includes all food and non-food packaging-related manufacturing operations located in Europe and Asia-Pacific as well as medical device and pharmaceutical packaging-related manufacturing operations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This segment manufactures multilayer polymer, blown and cast film structures to produce packaging sold for a variety of food, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, and industrial applications. These applications include processed and fresh meat, dairy, liquids, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, bakery, tissue, fresh produce, personal care and hygiene, pharmaceutical, and medical devices.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
While our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, substantially all sales are made by our direct sales force.  Sales offices and plants are located throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers.  Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization.

Sales to the Kraft Heinz Company, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11 and 10 percent of our sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Business arrangements with them and certain large customers require a large portion of the manufacturing capacity at a few individual manufacturing sites.  Any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time, which would allow for an orderly transition for both our manufacturing sites and the customer.

The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive.  Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price.  This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms.  Competitors include Amcor, Berry Global Group, Inc., Bryce Corporation, Coveris Holdings S.A., Printpack, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Sonoco Products Company, Wipak OY, Winpak Ltd, and a variety of other privately held companies.  

We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable.  Advertising is limited primarily to business and trade publications emphasizing our product features and related technical capabilities.

Raw Materials
Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use.  These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials.  While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions.  Currently, raw materials are readily available.
Environmental Matters
Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions.  These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material.  In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes.  

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding certain environmental matters.

Explanation of Terms Describing the Company’s Products
Aseptic packaging — Packaging used in a flash-heating process in which a food product and its packaging are sterilized separately and then combined and sealed under sterile conditions. This process retains more nutrients and uses less energy than conventional sterilization techniques and extends the shelf life of processed food without using preservatives.
Barrier products — Products that provide protection and extend the shelf life of the package contents.  These products provide protection from oxygen, moisture, light, odor, or other environmental factors by combining different types of plastics and additives into a multilayered plastic package.  
Cast film — A plastic film that is extruded through a straight slot die as a flat sheet during its manufacturing process.
Coextruded film — A blown or cast film extruded with multiple layers extruded simultaneously.
CSD labels — Carbonated soft drink labels.
Extruded film — A plastic film manufactured by forcing heated resin through a shaped die. This forms a tube of thin plastic film which is then expanded by an internal column of air to produce a continuous ribbon of film.
EZ Open packaging — Package technologies such as peelable closures or laser scoring used to allow the consumer easy access to a packaged product. EZ Open packaging may be combined with reclose features such as plastic zippers to allow for convenient storage of the packaged material once opened.
Film laminate — A multilayer plastic film made by laminating two or more films together with the use of adhesive or a molten plastic to achieve a barrier for the packaged contents.
Flexible pouches — A packaging option that delivers a semi-finished package, instead of rollstock, to a customer for filling product and sealing/closing the package for distribution.
Flexographic printing — The most common flexible packaging printing process using a raised rubber or alternative material image mounted on a printing cylinder.
Forming films — A flexible plastic film that is designed to take the shape determined by a cavity when subjected to heat and vacuum.
Injection molded plastic — Plastic that is created through a manufacturing process where heated plastic is injected into a die or mold.
Multipack — A film manufactured by a modified extrusion process that is used for wrapping and holding multipacks of products such as canned goods and bottles of liquids, replacing corrugate and fiberboard.
Narrow-web rolls — Films that are produced one-across at widths typically less than one meter and can be produced in either tube or roll form depending on the application.
Recyclable packaging — A film manufactured through proprietary methods that allows consumers to recycle through existing How2Recycle store drop-offs. 
Retort packaging — A multilayer flexible or rigid package able to withstand the thermal processing used for sterilization, similar to the process used for pressure cooking. The food is prepared and sealed in a package and then heated to approximately 250 degrees Fahrenheit under high pressure. This process extends the food product’s shelf life under normal room temperature conditions.
Rigid packaging — A form of packaging in which the shape of the package is retained as its contents are removed. Cups, tubs, trays and clamshell packaging are examples of rigid packaging options.
Rollstock — The principal form in which flexible packaging material is delivered to a customer.  Finished film wound on a core is converted in a process at the end user’s plant that forms, fills, and seals the package of product for delivery to customers.
Rotogravure printing — A high quality printing process utilizing a metal engraved cylinder.
Shrink bags/films — An extruded packaging film that is cooled, reheated, and stretched at a temperature near its melting point. The film is made to shrink around a product by an application of thermal treatment, and can be a barrier product if a layer of oxygen barrier material is added.
Specialty film — Plastic films that are produced for non-food applications and are typically used as either secondary packaging
or incorporated into a film structure to impart specific physical and /or performance characteristics.
Sterilization packaging — Packaging materials and preformed packaging systems that support the sterilization process, physical and sterile barrier protection through global distribution, and aseptic operating room presentation of life saving medical devices and technologies.
Thermoformed plastic packaging — A package formed by applying heat to a film to shape it into a tray or cavity and then sealing a flat film on top of the package after it has been filled.
Vacuum skin packaging ("VSP") — Vacuum skin packaging combines the benefits of traditional vacuum packs in terms of shelf life extension and premium second-skin presentation of meats, fish, and ready-made meals. VSP systems include multilayer high barrier top webs and adapted forming webs and trays.
