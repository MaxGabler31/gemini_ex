Company Overview
 
Highpower manufactures and sells Lithium-ion and Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. We also design and produce advanced battery packs and systems.
 
Rapid advancements in electronic technology have expanded the number of battery-powered devices in recent years. As these devices have come to feature more sophisticated functions, more compact sizes and lighter weights, the sources of power that operate these products have been required to deliver increasingly higher levels of energy. This has stimulated consumer demand for higher-energy batteries capable of delivering longer service between recharges or battery replacement. In contrast to non-rechargeable batteries, after a rechargeable battery is discharged, it can be recharged and reused. Rechargeable batteries generally can be used in many non-rechargeable battery applications, as well as high energy drain applications such as electric toys, power tools, portable computers and other electronics, medical devices, and many other consumer products. High energy density and long achievable cycle life are important characteristics of rechargeable battery technologies. Energy density refers to the total electrical energy per unit volume stored in a battery. High energy density batteries generally are longer lasting power sources providing longer operating time and necessitating fewer battery recharges. Greater energy density will permit the use of batteries of a given weight or volume for a longer time period. Long cycle life is a preferred feature of a rechargeable battery because it allows the user to charge and recharge many times before noticing a difference in performance. Long achievable cycle life, particularly in combination with high energy density, is desirable for applications requiring frequent battery recharges.
 
To adapt to this demand, SZ Highpower was founded to manufacture, market and research Ni-MH batteries. SZ Highpower’s predecessor was founded in Guangzhou in 2001, and moved to Shenzhen in 2002.

Below is organizational flow chart of the Company:
 


Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a global leader in the development and manufacture of rechargeable battery products. We believe the following strategies are the critical to achieve this goal:
 
Continue to pursue cost-effective opportunities
 
Our operating model, coupled with our modern manufacturing processes, has resulted in a low cost structure, and an ability to respond rapidly to customer demands. We intend to achieve greater cost-effectiveness by expanding production capacity, increasing productivity and efficiency and seeking to lower the unit cost of products through the use of advanced technologies.
 
Continue to invest in Research and Development (“R&D”)
 
In order to maintain our difference, we will continue to strengthen the investment in R&D. We have also established a good cooperative relationship with universities, such as Central South University and Tsinghua University.
 
Continue to focus on brand customers
 
We are committed to bringing quality products and services to brand customers in the world and the top of segment markets to ensure the customer brand value continuously grows.
 
Products
 
Our Ni-MH rechargeable batteries are versatile solutions for many diverse applications due to their long life, environmentally friendly materials, high power and energy, low cost and safe applications. Developed to meet the requirement for increasingly higher levels of energy demanded by today’s electronic products, our Ni-MH rechargeable batteries offer increased capacity and higher energy density to expect a longer running time between charges as well as the performance of cycle life exceeds 2000 cycles for high-end products.

Sales and Marketing
 
We have a broad sales network of approximately 70 sales and marketing staff in China and have one branch office in Hong Kong. Our sales staff in each of our offices targets key customers by arranging in-person sales presentations and providing after-sales services. Our sales staff works closely with our customers so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products. We offer different price incentives to encourage large-volume and long-term customers.
 
Sales from our customers are based primarily on purchase orders we receive from time to time rather than firm, long-term purchase commitments. Uncertain economic conditions and our general lack of long-term purchase commitments with our customers make it difficult for us to predict revenue accurately over the longer term. Even in those cases where customers are contractually obligated to purchase products from us, we may elect not to enforce our contractual rights immediately because of the long-term nature of our customer relationships and for other business reasons, and instead may negotiate accommodations with customers regarding particular situations.
 
We mainly engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities help in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 25.9% and 21.2% of our net sales were from our five largest customers, respectively. The percentages of net sales disclosed for each of our major customers includes sales to groups of customers under common control or that could be deemed affiliates of such major customers. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from many other battery manufacturers, some of which have significantly greater name recognition and financial, technical, manufacturing, personnel and other resources than we have. We compete against other Ni-MH and lithium-ion battery producers, as well as manufacturers of other rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. The main types of rechargeable batteries currently on the market include: lead-acid; Ni-Cad; Ni-MH; liquid lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer. Competition is typically based on design, quality, stability, and performance. The technology behind Ni-MH and lithium rechargeable batteries has consistently improved over time and we continue to enhance our products to meet the competitive threats from its competitors.
Supply of Raw Materials
 
The cost of the raw materials used in our rechargeable batteries is a key factor in the pricing of our products. We purchase materials in volume, which allows us to negotiate better pricing with our suppliers. Our purchasing department locates eligible suppliers of raw materials, striving to use only those suppliers who have previously demonstrated quality control and reliability.
 
For Ni-MH, we purchase raw materials, consisted primarily of metal materials including nickel oxide, nickel foam, metal hydride alloy and other battery components, such as membranes, from suppliers located in China and Japan. For lithium batteries, we purchase raw materials consisting primarily of LiCoO2, graphite and electrolyte. We believe that the raw materials and components used in manufacturing rechargeable batteries are available from enough sources to be able to satisfy our manufacturing needs; however, some of our materials relating to nickel and cobalt are available from a limited number of suppliers. One supplier accounted for 10.7% and no supplier accounted for over 10% of our total purchase amount during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Presently, our relationships with suppliers are generally good and we expect that our suppliers will be able to meet the anticipated demand for our products in the future.
 
Manufacturing
 
The manufacturing of rechargeable batteries requires coordinated use of machinery and raw materials at various stages of production. We have a large-scale active production base in Shenzhen and in Huizhou, a dedicated design, sales and marketing team and company-trained employees. We use automated machinery which enables us to enhance uniformity and precision during the manufacturing process. We intend to further improve our automated production lines and strive to continue investing in manufacturing infrastructures to further increase our manufacturing capacity, which help us control the unit cost of products.

Research and Development
 
To enhance our product quality, reduce cost, and keep pace with technological advances and evolving market trends, we have established an advanced research and development center. Our research and development center is not only focused on enhancing our Ni-MH and Lithium-based technologies by developing new products and improving the performance of our current products, but also seeks to develop alternative technologies. Our research institute is currently staffed with over 350 research and development technicians who overlook our basic research center, product development center, process engineering center, material analysis and performance testing labs. These teams work together to research new material and techniques, develop new products and push to mass production.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we expended $13,492,057 and $9,512,074, respectively, in research and development.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the battery industry. We regularly file patent applications to protect our research, development and design, and are currently pursuing numerous patent applications in China. Over time, we have accumulated a lot of patents in China. We also have a U.S. patent for safety technology on rechargeable batteries.
 
We also rely on unpatented technologies to protect the proprietary nature of our product and manufacturing processes. We require that our management team and key employees enter into confidentiality agreements that require the employees to assign the rights to any inventions developed by them during the course of their employment with us. The confidentiality agreements include noncompetition and non-solicitation provisions that remain effective during the course of employment and for periods following termination of employment, which vary depending on position and location of the employees.
 
Seasonality
 
The first quarter of each fiscal year tends to be our slow season due to the Chinese New Year holidays. Our factories and operations are usually shut down for 2 weeks during this time, resulting in lower sales during the first quarter.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,400 employees, all of whom were employed full-time. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good.
