The first element, Connect, aims to connect more customer workflows, industry life cycles, and solution offerings, so that we can continue to transform the way our customers work. This includes integrating more of our customers’ data through cloud offerings and making more of our solutions available over time on a subscription basis. Cloud enablement raises the bar with shared, on-demand services that empower network participants to proactively contribute to organic value creation and delivery directly and with fewer intermediaries. When end users interact on a shared, online platform, the overall value that is created increases as the number of end-user participants increases. This network effect means that the willingness of developers, partners, or end users to engage increases as the number of network participants grows, which further enhances the platform experience and end-user value. The second element, Scale, aims to invest in the people, processes, and technologies that are necessary to streamline and standardize our internal processes, provide a seamless experience for our customers as they engage with our connected solutions, and enable us to continue to grow our business efficiently and effectively for many years into the future.
•Increasing focus on software and services. Software and services targeted for the needs of vertical end markets are increasingly important elements of our solutions and are core to our growth strategy. We generally have an open application programming interface philosophy and open vendor environment, which leads to increased adoption of our software and analytics offerings. These software and services solutions integrate and optimize additional workflows for our customers, thereby improving their work productivity, and in the case of subscription, maintenance, and support services, also provide us with enhanced business visibility over time. Professional services constitute an additional customer offering that helps our customers integrate and optimize the use of our offerings in their environment.
•Focus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential. We focus on large markets historically underserved by technology that offer significant potential for long-term revenue growth, profitability, and market leadership. Our core industries, such as construction, agriculture, and transportation, are each multi-trillion dollar global industries that operate in demanding environments with technology adoption in the early phases relative to other industries. With the emergence of mobile and cloud computing capabilities, the increasing technological know-how of end users, and compelling return on investment, we believe many of our markets are attractive for substituting Trimble’s technology and solutions in place of traditional operating methods.
•Domain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base.  We have over time redefined our technological focus from hardware-driven point solutions to integrated work process solutions by developing domain expertise and heavily reinvesting in research and development (“R&D”) and acquisitions. We currently have over 1,000 unique patents reflective of our technology portfolio and deep domain knowledge to deliver specific, targeted solutions quickly and cost-effectively to each of the vertical markets we serve. We look for opportunities where the opportunity for technological change is high and that have a requirement for the integration of multiple technologies into complete vertical solutions.

We currently have distribution channels in over 85 countries, and sales are supported by our own offices located in over 40 countries around the world. 
•Optimized go-to-market strategies to best access our markets.  We utilize vertically focused go-to-market strategies that leverage domain expertise to best serve the needs of individual markets both domestically and abroad. These go-to-market capabilities include independent dealers, joint ventures, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and distribution alliances with key partners, such as CNH Industrial, Caterpillar, and Nikon, as well as direct sales to end users, which provide us with broad market reach and localization capabilities to effectively serve our markets.

•Strategic acquisitions.  Organic growth continues to be our primary focus, while acquisitions serve to enhance our market position. We acquire businesses that bring domain expertise, geographic presence, technology, products, and distribution capabilities that augment our portfolio and allow us to penetrate existing markets more effectively, or to establish a market beachhead. Our success in targeting and effectively integrating acquisitions is an important aspect of our growth strategy.
•Venture fund investments. In 2021, we announced a newly formed strategic venture fund. With this fund, we expect to invest up to $200 million in early- to growth-stage companies that can accelerate innovation and effectively bring new solutions to our customers and the industries that we serve and would give us an early, inside look and stake in emerging business and technology solutions.
•Sustainability. The global economy is experiencing a fundamental shift toward sustainability driven through broad stakeholder engagement, with a focus on decarbonization. Historically, through delivering productivity and efficiency gains, Trimble products have delivered sustainability for our customers, and we envision more opportunities to deliver expanded carbon reductions and other sustainability benefits, such as water management in agriculture and utilities, for our customers through our Connect and Scale and the other strategies we have described. 
Our focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model. As our solutions have expanded, our go-to-market model has also evolved, with a balanced mix between direct, distribution, and OEM customers, as well as an increasing number of enterprise-level customer relationships.

In quarterly business reviews, we review gender and U.S. ethnicity demographics and trends for every business within Trimble, as well as region and business-led initiatives that will lead toward future progress. 

We have a number of employee resource networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including networks that support women, caregivers, Black, Hispanic/Latinx and Indian professionals, veterans, employees with disabilities, and our LGBTQ+ community. We are focused on measuring and increasing gender representation, as well as race and ethnic diversity in high-impact roles such as front-line management, engineering, product management, and sales. We have provided increased access to diversity and inclusion educational resources, training, assessments, articles, and other employee forums to help us work together and more effectively across a variety of cultures globally. 
We are committed to inspiring and attracting extraordinary and diverse talent. The hiring and retention of top talent is always a strategic priority, and increasingly, a challenging one. In addition, our increasing focus on technologies, such as cloud and autonomy, requires us to compete against leading companies in the technology sector. Colleges and universities remain an important source of talented recruits. We aim to transform and re-invent the way Trimble attracts and hires employees to increase diversity. Initiatives include modifications to our recruiting process to ensure the inclusion of diverse, underrepresented candidates, developing relationships with universities with higher underrepresentation, creating diverse talent pools, and increasing networking and referrals with diverse professional organizations. 
In 2021, we created our Renew Returnship program that provides employment opportunities for those who have taken a break in their careers to look after their families. We engaged in new relationships with the National Society of Black Engineers, participated in national and local diversity career fairs, and sponsored new engagements focused on increasing gender and race/ethnic diversity in the industries we serve through groups like Construction and Transportation Girl. We announced the Dr. Gladys West Scholarship Program through the Trimble Foundation to honor a GPS technology pioneer and woman of color by awarding scholars at three universities serving underrepresented students, and we also added new Trimble technology labs at Minority Serving Institutions.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe people should be paid for the role they perform and their skills and experience, regardless of their gender, race, age, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role, their experience, their performance, and the region in which they live. We also regularly review our compensation practices to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. In addition to base salaries, certain roles are eligible to participate in short-term and long-term incentive plans.
We offer market competitive benefit programs (which vary by country/region), which include health and wellness benefits, life insurance and disability benefits, flexible savings accounts, paid time off, parental and family leave, employee support programs, retirement plans, and an employee stock purchase plan. Other benefits include fertility, adoption, and surrogacy education assistance; gender dysphoria, family and caregiver support; flexible work schedules; education assistance; and on-site services such as health centers and fitness centers at some sites.
Talent Development
We are committed to providing every employee with the opportunity to learn, grow, and excel in a respectful and collaborative workplace. Part of our people development mission is to create a culture of continuous learning and curiosity. We believe that skills and abilities can be developed through training, relationships, and experiential learning. We are launching new career growth and development initiatives to empower employees to identify skill development resources, and provide projects and job opportunities to achieve their personal goals and full potential. We encourage employees to nurture a love of continuous learning and a resilience that is essential for accomplishment. 
We have a framework for people development that is employee-centric and evidence-based. Employees and managers have frequent, casual conversations based upon employee survey data that drive engagement, career growth, and retention. These surveys also include questions oriented around the Company’s mission, vision, values, and purpose, work environment, diversity and inclusion, career development, and employee-manager relations. Our internal worldwide training portal, Learn.Trimble.com, provides a set of resources that is easy to access anytime and anywhere, with a range of focus areas from new employees to existing employee development to manager development. 
Building Connections
We believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. Since our employees are passionate about a variety of causes, our company giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants and employee fundraising. We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees.  Lastly, we encourage and provide our employees with a day of service as a benefit to help our communities. 

Our Trimble Foundation aligns international philanthropic efforts by giving back to the communities where Trimble does business and helping those in need. We do this by supporting three focus areas, disaster and climate resilience; female education and empowerment; and diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as by supporting the philanthropic efforts of our local offices. 
Health, Safety, and Wellness
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
