THE COMPANY
 
Our Corporate History
 
Quality Online Education Group Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on September 20, 2007 as Life Nutrition Products, Inc. and was previously a dietary supplement company specializing in the development marketing and distribution of all natural, proprietary, dietary supplements under the names Trim For Life® Appetite Control and Trim For Life® Energy Formula. Pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation filed with the State of Delaware and effective as of July 19, 2013, LNP changed its corporate name to “ADGS Advisory, Inc.”. On May 14, 2021, the Company changed its name to Quality Online Education Group Inc., and its symbol to “QOEG.”
 
On September 7, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Conqueror Share Exchange Agreement”) with Conqueror Group Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (“Conqueror”) and Acumen Charm Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation (the “Conqueror Shareholder”). Pursuant to the Conqueror Share Exchange Agreement, at the closing of the transaction contemplated in the Conqueror Share Exchange Agreement (the “Conqueror Transaction”), the Company was to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Conqueror from the Conqueror Shareholder, making Conqueror a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The Closing was to transpire on or before January 31, 2011 but it did not occur by that date. However, as of May 11, 2011, among other things, Michael M. Salerno, the Company’s then sole officer and director, resigned as an officer and director of the Company, and appointed Chu Zhanjun and Li Gang as directors, and Chu Zhanjun as President, Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Company, each a designee of Conqueror. As a result, a change in control occurred, due to the resignation of Mr. Salerno as sole officer and director, appointment of Mr. Chu as President, Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Company, and appointment of Mr. Chu and Mr. Li as directors. At the time, the parties anticipated that the transaction contemplated by the Conqueror Share Exchange Agreement would not be completed at any time in future.
 
On December 7, 2012, LNP entered into the Original Exchange Agreement with ADGS and ADGS Holding. Pursuant to the Original Exchange Agreement, at the closing of the transaction contemplated thereunder (the “Transaction”), we agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ADGS, making ADGS a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On March 28, 2013, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Original Exchange Agreement (the Original Exchange Agreement, as amended is referred to in this report as the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Almonds Kisses Limited (BVI), a British Virgin Islands company (“Almonds Kisses BVI”), from the eight shareholders of Almonds Kisses BVI (the “Shareholders”), instead of the shares of ADGS, on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement. Almonds Kisses BVI is the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ADGS. The Original Exchange Agreement incorrectly indicated that such owner was ADGS Holdings which error was corrected in the Amendment. The Shareholders are Tong Wing Yee, Tong Wing Shan, Tso Yin Yee, Pang Yiu Kwong, Sin Kok Ho, Fahy Roase-Collette, Tsang Kwai Chun and ADGS Holdings, each of whom executed the Amendment. In addition, on March 28, 2013, the parties to the Exchange Agreement entered into an Extension Agreement (the “Extension Agreement”) extending the closing date of the Transaction to on or before April 15, 2013.
 
Thus, upon consummation of the Acquisition which occurred on April 12, 2013, Almonds Kisses BVI became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of Almonds Kisses BVI became our controlling shareholders, and Almond Kisses BVI in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ADGS. In January 2013, Almonds Kisses BVI also became the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Vantage, a Hong Kong corporation. Almond Kisses (BVI) in turn also owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Vantage. ADGS owns 80% of ADGS Tax Advisory Limited (“ADGS Tax”) which is a Hong Kong incorporated holding company, and ADGS Tax owns a 30% interest in Dynamic Golden Limited which is also a Hong Kong incorporated company.

Almonds Kisses BVI was incorporated on March 1, 2011 as a limited liability company in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) and, as originally constituted, was owned by the eight Shareholders identified above. ADGS is a Hong Kong corporation which was incorporated on April 28, 2011 and, as originally constituted, was solely owned by Tong Wing Yee and Tong Wing Shan (two of the shareholders of Almonds Kisses BVI) until being acquired by Almonds Kisses BVI pursuant to a transaction completed on April 30, 2011 in contemplation of the Acquisition. In this regard and in anticipation of effecting a transaction which resulted in the Acquisition, on April 30, 2011 Tong Wing Yee and Tong Wing Shan exchanged their shares for additional shares in Almonds Kisses BVI in order to create a BVI holding company structure for the operating business. British Virgin Islands holding companies have been utilized in Hong Kong for many years by entrepreneurs undertaking business in Hong Kong. Management believes such structure may provide certain advantages in the future in that shares held in a Hong Kong corporation are subject to a fairly substantial stamp duty on the transfer of any of such shares while the transfer of shares in a BVI company is not subject to any stamp duty in the BVI. In addition, Management further believes the BVI holding company structure may provide other benefits in the future including more corporate flexibility in that mergers can be effected by a BVI company compared to Hong Kong where a Hong Kong company is not able to merge with any entity insofar that a merger is not provided for under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.
 
On July 19, 2013, Life Nutrition Products, Inc. changed its name to ADGS Advisory, Inc. The Company also changed its symbol from LIPN to ADGS on such date. ADGS Advisory, Inc. is a holding company.
 
On December 11, 2019, Rhonda Keaveney purchased 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Series A Stock from the Company, resulting in Ms. Keaveney gaining voting control of the Company
 
On January 30, 2020, Rhonda Keaveney sold the controlling voting shares to Golden Panegyric Inc., and a change of control took place.
 
On June 26, 2020, Golden Panegyric Inc. sold the controlling voting shares to Xuye Wu, and a change of control took place.
 
On August 31, 2020, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired Quality Online Education Group Inc., an Ontario company, in exchange for 3 Billion (3,000,000,000) shares of common stock of the Company, and a change of control occurred.
 
On May 14, 2021, the Company changed its name to Quality Online Education Group Inc., and its symbol to “QOEG.”
 
On August 25, 2022, the Company was qualified for the Reg A.

Our Products
 
We have designed a holistic learning solution that enhances effective learning through the integration of live lessons, practice, and mentoring. Our academic materials for K12 students include pre-reading, picture books, videos, and songs. Through our custom-built mobile solutions, students and parents can set their goals and follow student progress in a one-stop service. Before taking lessons, students preview course materials using exercises and illustrations, supported by a pronunciation recognition and rating system. Our teaching assistants mentor students by coaching them on the proper learning methods and attending to their needs throughout the learning process. We have designed a holistic learning solution that enhances effective learning through the integration of live lessons, practice, assessment, and mentoring. Our live lessons allow for frequent interactions between students and teachers, which is a key factor in improving English communication skills. Assessments includes post-lesson quizzes, both of which help students better assess their learning outcome and identify areas for improvement.
 
Live lessons
 
One on one online lessons with native English speaker teachers
 
A majority of our students take live one-on-one lessons. Lessons are typically 25 minutes long. Teachers and students interact using real-time audio and visual streaming technology. Our teachers provide instructions using our standardized curriculum. Teachers are allowed to adjust the pace of each lesson according to student performance and reaction, thus accommodating students across all learning curves.
 
In order to give students a consistent and seamless learning experience, we arrange the same teacher for most of the classes for each student, and the teaching assistants regularly review the feedback from students, their parents, and the teachers.
 
We pack our lessons into 3 groups – 75 lessons valid for 9 months, 150 lessons valid for 18 months, and 300 lessons valid for 36 months. The unit lesson price is different regarding the package the students choose and the teacher’s teaching experience and background, ranging from USD $6.5 to $17.2.
 
Small class lessons with native English speaker teachers
 
In April 2021, we launched our small class program to give students more options that cater to their needs to learn with peers, with a fixed schedule, fixed classmates, and fixed teachers.
 
Students opting in for small class lessons will choose a class with a fixed teacher designated for the class and a fixed weekly schedule for a period of approximately three months. Students will take two lessons each week. Each lesson comprises two 25-minute sessions. Each small class is composed of up to four students. The small class lesson format encourages students to interact with the teachers and classmates and engage students in the in-class environment through learning with the same groups of classmates and teachers every time.
 
We offer the lesson in 3 groups – autumn term package, spring term package, and 1-year package. About 60 lessons for each term and 120 lessons for 1 year. The unit lesson price is USD $ 4.15.
 
Effective Practice
 
Students are encouraged to preview course materials through our APP platform. Pre-lesson learning is particularly important, as such a process allows young students to engage in more productive interactions with teachers during live lessons.
 
Our pre-lesson studying system contains key vocabulary, word pronunciation practice, and grammar learning points. Our system is interactive, featuring audio functions that allow students to hear the correct pronunciation of key vocabulary words and model sentences. Students can record their pronunciation of individual words to be graded by our system. To build a more instinctive understanding of the English language for our students, our pre-lesson studying system relies on cartoons or interesting graphic stories to explain the meaning of vocabulary and phrases, rather than simply presenting the translation.

Mentoring by local service team
 
We maintain a pool of service teams or teachers for our students all around the world. The customer service is provided by a third-party service partner. We are planning to hire local service teams as our customer base grow in France, Brazil, Thailand and Vietnam. We have established stringent selection criteria and will make hiring decisions based on education service experience.
 
Business Partners
 
We also provide a one-stop educational service to our business partners, including recruiting native English speaker tutors, customizing teaching content, and training the tutors. We provide native English speaker tutor recruiting and training services to business customers. Given the interactive nature of our lessons and targeting students, we seek to engage teachers who have a strong command of the English language and good communication skills. Prospective candidates must go through a resume screening, phone interview screening, pre-service orientation, new teacher training, and demonstration to be qualified to deliver live lessons to our students. We also leverage the native English speaker tutor recruiting and training services to business customers.
 
Teacher engagement
 
Our teachers from the Philippines and North America have high English proficiency and experience in service industries or the education industry. The individual skill sets and backgrounds of prospective teachers, combined with our rigorous selection and training program, have enabled us to build a team of passionate and patient teachers who are highly qualified to assist students in meeting their learning objectives. The majority of our teachers are university graduates in the Philippine, including many from reputable universities, medical and nursing schools, as well as experienced teachers. For our American Academy program, we mainly engage teachers from North America with primary school and kindergarten teaching experience.
 
We attract applicants through various online social media platforms and career websites and regularly participate in job fairs in the Philippines.
 
Teacher training and development
 
Through the ongoing online enhancement of teaching methods and teacher training centers in the Philippines, most of our teachers can develop the skills to communicate key learning points more effectively to our students. We believe that empowering our teachers with these skills is essential to improve the student experience and ensuring that our students receive a quality education. We also add requirements and customize the training content according to the demand or the business customers.
 
The newly engaged teachers are generally required to undergo standard training programs that focus on the curriculum from us or business customers, teaching skills in a live lesson setting, as well as the learning about the behavior and objectives of different types of students. After completing our new teacher training program, the candidates will be assessed by our team of experienced evaluators before they are allowed to offer lessons on our platform or start the service for our business customers.
 
The teachers are ranked according to student feedback and peer evaluation process. Teachers must accumulate the required amount of teaching hours, maintain high student ratings, and complete the training modules to get a promotion or salary increase. Our training program is updated and customized based on changes to our curriculum, the demand of business customers, and feedback from our quality assurance team and students.

Most of our management team is based in Ontario, Canada. Most of the full time tutors we hire are in the Philippines. Our main operation functions such as accounting, education content, R&D, IT, and marketing are based in Toronto. We have tutor resource management vendors in the Philippines. We have sales partners in Southeast Asia, Europe and South America. Historically, Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., as a sales and service center for Chinese customers, collected the revenue from Chinese customers and Quality Online Education Group Inc. (Ontario) collected the revenue from the customers of other areas. The Company adjusted the organization structure in September 2021. All the revenues including those from China is collected by Quality Online Education Group Inc. (Ontario). From Dec 2021, we stopped acquiring new students from mainland China. The Company ceased offering tutoring services to students in mainland China in the end of April 2022.
 
Our Strategy – Business Plan
 
Quality Online Education Group, QOEG’s operating company, was founded in August 2018 in Ontario Canada with a global reach. We provide comprehensive online English lessons to students around the world. English education resources are unbalanced between areas. The students in some of the Southeast Asia and European countries are extremely under-served. To address this unmet need, we have developed online and mobile education platforms, customized the content and optimized the marketing method to provide high quality yet affordable products that enable students around the world to take live English lessons with English native speaking teachers. We connect our students with highly qualified foreign teachers. The teachers have gone through our rigorous selection and training process before they deliver lessons to the students. We hire, train, and manage our tutors for North America and the Philippines.
 
Our market consists of students from K12 to adults. The lessons we provide are focused on the interaction and application of English as well as test preparation such as IELTS.
 
While remaining based in Canada, we have successfully launched a direct selling model around the world. This business model is cost-effective, enabling us to save significant sales and marketing dollars and build a stronger cash flow outlook compared to the competitors who only use online advertising.
 
We are also launching small group lessons, one teacher teaches 2-4 students online at the same time, which unit price is lower than other competitors, which may be affordable for more students in our target cities yet with a higher margin.
 
We intend to further develop our sales of our online products through making it available and recognized in more and more countries in need of English teaching resources. Moreover, we anticipate a greater margin of profit by increasing the student retention rate and launching new product lines, like group lessons.
 
All our cash is paid directly by our customers to our Canadian company. We pay service expenses and sales commissions to the service partners in different countries for the local customer service.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The online English education services market in general is fragmented, rapidly evolving, and highly competitive. We also face competition from other online and mobile platforms or internet companies that plan to expand their business into English education.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:
 

● | scope and quality of course offerings; 
--+-------------------------------------------


● | quality and performance of the teachers; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | overall student experience and satisfaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | ability to effectively market course offerings to target customer groups, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cost-effectiveness of courses; 
--+-----------------------------------

We believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete in the selected cities’ market in which we operate on the basis of our innovative approach to acquire students, scalable and efficient business model, extensive and high-quality teacher network, high course quality, and experienced management team caring about all the stakeholders including students, parents of our students, business partners, as well as the tutors.
 
However, some of our current or future competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, or greater financial, technical, or marketing resources than we do. For a discussion of risks related to competition, see more discussion in “Risk Factors”.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
To customer business marketing and sales
 
We market our platform through a combination of online social media and offline channels, and we also generate sales leads through referrals, which we called “The Mommy Influencer Sales”.
The Mommy Influencers
 
We have historically generated a significant percentage of our sales leads through word-of-mouth referrals by our students and their parents in K-12 product lines. New enrollments through word-of-mouth referrals have benefited from the rapid growth in our student base, as well as our reputation, brand, and the proven learning results of our students. We integrated social network functionalities into our mobile app, such as sharing functions with WeChat, to encourage students to share their learning experiences with their friends. We believe the rapid growth of our K-12 student base, greater brand awareness, and the success of our K-12 students in achieving their English learning objectives lead to more word-of-mouth referrals and the purchase of larger course packages by our K-12 students initially.
 
We have a KOL (Key Opinion Leader) marketing ecosystem in online and offline communities, including online social media groups and offline training camps. the KOLs bring significant leads to our sales team. We pay influencers when their referrals end up buying the products. It’s known in marketing circles as fission sales. To support this sales model, we developed a virtual campus system and recruit headmasters for the virtual campus. Each headmaster manages a group of mummy influencers who provide leads to our telemarketing team.
 
Our telemarketing teams follow-up on sales leads by providing additional information and support and trying to convince prospective students to enroll in our free trial lessons. Our course consultants then follow up with prospective students who have taken our free trial lessons and promote course packages most suited to each student’s background, proficiency, and learning objectives.
 
Branding
 
We are focused on promoting our brand and increasing the overall effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. In 2019, we engaged Chris Downs, a Canadian educator, author, teacher, celebrity, and popular guest star of a TV series and movies in China. We believe Chris’s success in his career and image echoes with our company principle on delivering good quality education for all the students.
 
To business marketing and sales
 
We also provide online English tutor solutions to business customers by direct sales model. We help the business customers build up their own brand online English lessons or add native English speaker tutors. Many small-medium education centers and institutions around the globe are interested in expanding their product line to foreign teacher English lessons, for example, after school tutoring centers, kid’s picture book clubs, immigration agencies etc.
 
We provide holistic solutions to business customers including recruiting, training, and managing the tutors. Our dedicated corporate sales force regularly communicates with potential business clients in every city we enter.

Regulation
 
From Dec 2021, we stopped acquiring the students live in mainland China. In compliance with the New Regulation, the “Opinions on Further Alleviating the Burden of Homework and After-School Tutoring for Students in Compulsory Education” published in July 2021 by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council of the PRC, the Company ceased offering tutoring services to students in mainland China in the end of April 2022.
 
About 550 students in mainland China were still active, which was about 1/3 of our monthly active students by end of Feb 2022. The lessons of those active students were delivered, and contracts were terminated by the end of April 2022. We haven’t had any operations in China since then.
 
The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the ICP Measures, promulgated by the PRC State Council and as last amended on January 8, 2011, sets forth more specific rules on the provision of internet information services. According to the ICP Measures, any company that engages in the provision of commercial internet information services must obtain a sub-category VATS License for Internet Information Services, or the ICP License, from the relevant government authorities before providing any commercial internet information services within the PRC. The Company does not have a proper ICP license after the termination of the only existing VIE contract with Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd.
 
On July 24, 2021 China’s official state media, including Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television, announced the Opinions on Further Alleviating the Burden of Homework and After-School Tutoring for Students in Compulsory Education (the “Opinion”), issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council. The Opinion contains high-level policy directives about requirements and restrictions related to online and offline after-school tutoring services, including, (i) foreign capital is prohibited from controlling or participating in Academic AST providers through merger and acquisitions, entrusted operations, joining franchise or using variable interest entities. (ii) banning foreign teachers located overseas from providing tutoring services in China.
 
This Opinion does affect the operation in China. The company made following restructurings and decisions.
 
Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in the value-added telecommunications market, we operated our online platform through Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd, our consolidated variable interest entity, or VIE, in the PRC. Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd held our ICP license necessary to operate our online service in China. We relied on a series of contractual arrangements among Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd and its shareholders to operate our online and mobile platforms in China. We did not have equity interests in Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd. However, as a result of these contractual arrangements, we were the primary beneficiary of Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd and treat it as our consolidated VIE under U.S. GAAP.
 
We terminated the VIE contract in September 2021 and entered a new service contract with Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd as one of the suppliers on global online market research, education consulting and information technology consulting service. Our agreement with Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co. is attached hereto as an Exhibit. By the termination of the VIE contracts the company also does not have proper ICP license to deliver online education service to students in mainland China. Thus, we ceased the operations in China in the end of April 2022.
 
The Company is not planning to invest in Tianjin Zhipin Education Technology Co., Ltd. or any other companies in China. We no longer own any companies or invest in any companies in China as a foreign investor.
 
The Company’s compliance with these measures will not have a material adverse impact on its existing business in the countries other than China. To make sure our customers are not from mainland China, we stopped the marketing and sales activities in mainland China, and the updated service agreement required the customers announce that they are not living in mainland China. Our updated service agreement is attached hereto as an Exhibit.
