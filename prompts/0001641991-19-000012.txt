FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements in this document and any documents incorporated by reference, including any statements as to operational and financial projections, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses’ or our industries’ actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, or changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. Particular risks facing us include business, internal operations, legal and regulatory risks, costs of raw materials, pricing pressures, and changes in the economy.  These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management’s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets.
All the forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” and in any documents incorporated by reference herein that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new businesses and product lines. We cannot predict these new risk factors, and we cannot assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no obligation to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this document.
BUSINESS
Our Business
SPX FLOW, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“SPX FLOW,” ‘‘the Company,’’ “we,” “us,” or “our”) operate in three business segments. Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, SPX FLOW innovates with customers to help feed and enhance the world by designing, delivering and servicing high value solutions at the heart of growing and sustaining our diverse communities. The Company's product offering is concentrated in rotating, actuating and hydraulic technologies, as well as automated process systems, into food and beverage, industrial and power and energy markets. In 2018, SPX FLOW had approximately $2.1 billion in annual revenues with operations in more than 30 countries and sales in more than 150 countries, with approximately 40%, 35%, and 25% from sales into the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively.
We serve the food and beverage, power and energy and industrial markets. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, mixers, filters, air dryers, hydraulic tools, homogenizers, separators and heat exchangers, along with the related aftermarket parts and services, supports global industries, including food and beverage, oil and gas, power generation (including nuclear and conventional), chemical processing, compressed air and mining. From an end market perspective, in 2018, approximately 36% of our revenues were from sales into the food and beverage end markets, approximately 28% were from sales into the power and energy end markets, and approximately 36% were from sales into the industrial end markets. Our core strengths include expertise in rotating, actuating and hydraulic equipment, a highly skilled workforce, global capabilities, product breadth, and a deep application knowledge that enables us to optimize configuration and create custom-engineered solutions for diverse processes.
Between 2015 and 2017 we executed a multi-year, global realignment plan to transition our organization to an operating structure, improve our competitive position and increase our ability to serve customers. As part of this plan, we optimized our 
1

global footprint by consolidating eight manufacturing sites and a shared service center.  In addition, we improved our capabilities in high value countries, streamlined several business processes and reduced selling, general and administrative expense across our support functions. The majority of the improvements tied to the global realignment program are structural in nature to allow us to operate at a lower cost structure and more efficiently.
We have aligned our segment teams to focus primarily on developing intimate customer relationships and expanding our relevance to customers within each end market.  The key areas our end market teams are emphasizing include (i) product management, (ii) channel development, (iii) localization and (iv) project execution and delivery. We made substantial progress in these areas during 2017 and 2018. Our ultimate goal was to create a more customer-centric, service-oriented organization and deliver greater value to our customers, investors and employees.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments — Food and Beverage, Power and Energy, and Industrial. The following summary describes the products and services offered by each of our reportable segments:
Food and Beverage:  Our Food and Beverage reportable segment operates in a regulated, global industry with customers who demand highly engineered, turn-key solutions. Key demand drivers include dairy consumption, emerging market capacity expansion, sustainability and productivity initiatives, customer product innovation and food safety. Key products for the segment include mixing, drying, evaporation and separation systems and components, heat exchangers, and reciprocating and centrifugal pump technologies. We also design and construct turn-key systems that integrate many of these products for our customers. Our core brands include Anhydro, APV, Bran+Luebbe, Gerstenberg Schroeder, LIGHTNIN, Seital and Waukesha Cherry-Burrell. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Fristam Pumps, GEA Group AG, Krones AG, Südmo, Tetra Pak International S.A. and various regional companies.  
Power and Energy: Our Power and Energy reportable segment primarily serves customers in the oil and gas industry and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear and other conventional power industries. A large portion of the segment's revenues are concentrated in oil extraction, production and transportation at existing wells, and in pipeline applications. The underlying driver of this segment includes demand for power and energy. Key products for the segment include pumps, valves and the related accessories, while the core brands include APV, Bran+Luebbe, ClydeUnion Pumps, Copes-Vulcan, Dollinger Filtration, LIGHTNIN, M&J Valve, Plenty and Vokes. The segment's primary competitors are Cameron, Ebara Fluid Handling, Flowserve Corporation, ITT Goulds Pumps, KSB AG and Sulzer Ltd.  
Industrial: Our Industrial reportable segment primarily serves customers in the chemical, air treatment, mining, pharmaceutical, marine, shipbuilding, infrastructure construction, general industrial and water treatment industries. Key demand drivers of this segment are tied to macroeconomic conditions and growth in the respective end markets we serve. Key products for the segment are air dryers, filtration equipment, mixers, pumps, hydraulic technologies and heat exchangers. Core brands include Airpel, APV, Bolting Systems, Delair, Deltech, Hankison, Jemaco, Johnson Pump, LIGHTNIN, Power Team and Stone. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Chemineer Inc., EKATO, Actuant, Enerpac, IDEX Viking Pump, KSB AG, Parker Domnick Hunter and various regional companies.
Acquisitions
We have not acquired any businesses since SPX FLOW was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company from SPX Corporation in September 2015. As part of our long-term strategy, we plan to evaluate potential acquisitions that (a) are complementary to our existing products and services, (b) increase our relevance to customers and our capabilities to serve them, (c) expand our global capabilities and accelerate our localization strategy and (d) expand our end market reach.
Research and Development
We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 156 domestic and 299 foreign patents, including 31 patents that were issued in 2018, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate 
2

our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors—Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.”
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, titanium, nickel and petroleum-based products. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower the overall cost of raw materials. In addition, due to our diverse product and service offering, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. However, we are not dependent on any one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Lastly, we continue to centralize certain aspects of supply chain management in an effort to ensure adequate materials are available for production at low cost. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors—The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.”
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors are diverse, ranging from large multi-nationals to regional and local companies. Our principal global competitors include Alfa Laval AB, Flowserve Corporation, GEA Group AG, IDEX Corporation, ITT Goulds Pumps, Sulzer Ltd. and Tetra Pak International S.A. We do not have any one competitor with all the same product offerings, nor do we have any one competitor which serves all the same end markets. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends on a variety of factors including breadth of product offering, product quality, engineering strength, brand reputation, lead times, global capabilities, service capabilities, and cost. As many of our products are sold through distributors and independent representatives, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. 
Backlog
Information with respect to the backlog of each of the Company's segments at December 31, 2018 is presented in “MD&A—Results of Reportable Segments.”
Environmental Matters
See “MD&A — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates — Contingent Liabilities,” “Risk Factors—We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 
Employment 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 7,000 employees. Less than 1% of our U.S. employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, while certain of our non-U.S. employee groups are covered by various collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 
Executive Officers 
See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 
Other Matters 
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 
The financial results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. In aggregate, our businesses tend to be stronger in the second 
3

half of the calendar year. Additionally, timing of revenue recognition on large Food and Beverage systems projects, Power and Energy projects and large Industrial orders may cause significant fluctuations in financial performance from period to period.
