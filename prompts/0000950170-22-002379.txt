 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
Our goal is to bring perception to all devices. Through our Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (“FMCW”) sensing technology, we believe we are introducing the world’s first 4D LiDAR-on-chip that, along with our proprietary software applications, enables the adoption of LiDAR across broad applications. We believe that our solutions will allow for the wide-scale adoption of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary 4D LiDAR technology has the potential to enable new categories for perception across consumer electronics, consumer health, industrial automation and security applications.
Founded in 2017 by former Apple engineers Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk and led by a multidisciplinary team of engineers and operators experienced in the field of sensing and perception, Aeva’s mission is to bring the next wave of perception technology to broad applications from automated driving to consumer electronics, consumer health, industrial automation and security. Our 4D LiDAR-on-chip combines silicon photonics technology that is proven in the telecom industry with precise instant velocity measurements and long-range performance for commercialization.
 On March 12, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Aeva, Inc. consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) with InterPrivate Acquisition Corp. (the Company’s predecessor, which was originally incorporated in Delaware as a special purpose acquisition company (“IPV”)) pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated as of November 2, 2020 (the “BCA”), by and among IPV, WLLY Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of IPV, and Aeva, Inc. Immediately upon the consummation of the Business Combination, WLLY Merger Sub Corp. merged with and into Aeva, Inc., with Aeva, Inc. surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of IPV. IPV changed its name to Aeva Technologies, Inc. and the pre-combination Aeva retained its name of Aeva, Inc.
 

As a development stage company, we work closely with our customers on the development and commercialization of their programs and the utilization of our products in such programs. Thus far, our customers have purchased prototype products and engineering services from us for use in their research and development programs. We are expanding our manufacturing capacity through third-party manufacturers to meet our customers’ anticipated demand for the production of our products.
Unlike legacy 3D LiDAR, which relies on Time-to-Flight (“ToF”) technology and measures only depth and reflectivity, Aeva’s solution leverages a proprietary FMCW technology to measure velocity in addition to depth, reflectivity and inertial motion. We believe the ability of Aeva’s solution to measure instant velocity for every pixel is a major advantage over ToF-based sensing solutions. Furthermore, Aeva’s technology is free from interference from other LiDAR beams and sunlight, and our core innovations within FMCW are intended to enable autonomous vehicles to see at significantly higher distances up to 500 meters.
We believe the advantages of our 4D LiDAR-on-chip allows us to provide the first LiDAR solution that is fully integrated onto a chip with superior performance at scale, with the potential to allow for the wide-scale adoption of autonomous driving and drive new categories of perception across industrial automation, consumer electronics, consumer health, aerospace, and security markets.
 Technology Overview
With the world’s first LiDAR that is integrated onto a silicon photonics chip module, Aeva’s proprietary FMCW technology combines instant velocity measurement for each pixel, superior long-range performance, immunity from any LiDAR or sunlight interference, at low optical power. We believe that the advantages of our innovative sensing technology allows us to address the next generation of autonomous driving applications.
 Beyond automotive applications, Aeva’s 4D LiDAR architecture enables superior resolution and precise velocity sensing, which we believe positions Aeva to potentially drive new perception categories for industrial automation, consumer electronics, consumer health, and security applications.
Aeva’s 4D LiDAR Technology
Our 4D LiDAR technology is based on an approach that is fundamentally different from 3D ToF technology and traditional FMCW LiDAR technologies. Our technology differentiation is rooted in Aeva’s:
•proprietary FMCW design; 
 •integrated silicon photonics technology; 
 •custom digital processing application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”); and 
 •4D Perception software.
 Aeva’s Proprietary FMCW Design
Unlike legacy 3D LiDAR, which relies on ToF technology to transmit high power pulses of light to measure an object’s range, Aeva’s 4D LiDAR uses a continuous, low power laser beam to measure the change in frequency of the waveform as it reflects off an object. This allows our 4D LiDAR to detect the instant velocity of every point with centimeters per second precision and measure range at distances up to 500 meters.
Aeva’s 4D LiDAR is also free of interference from other LiDAR beams and sunlight and operates at fractions of the optical power that is typically required to achieve long range performance in 3D ToF systems.


We believe that Aeva’s proprietary 4D LiDAR technology approach addresses some of the critical hurdles that have previously slowed the broad adoption of automotive LiDAR that is based on legacy 3D ToF technology:
   
Integration on silicon photonics enables compact form factor | Integrating the key optical components of a LiDAR onto one small silicon photonics module allows for compact form factor for volume scale 
Free of interference | By carrying a unique signature for each beam, our 4D LiDAR can block any source of power that does not carry the unique signature, rendering it free of interference from other LiDAR and sunlight.
High sensitivity | Aeva’s 4D LiDAR is highly sensitive, which allows for long range performance up to 500 meters. 
High dynamic range | Aeva’s 4D LiDAR is not prone to noise effects observed in ToF technologies when measuring highly reflective objects such as traffic signs on the road. 
Higher sensitivity in inclement weather | Aeva’s 4D LiDAR has the potential to perform better in inclement weather by taking advantage of the continuous transmission of laser beams as opposed to short pulses in ToF LiDARs. 
Instantaneous measurement of velocity | Aeva’s 4D LiDAR can directly measure the instantaneous velocity of every pixel by measuring the Doppler effects caused by the dynamic motion of objects. 
Laser Safety | Due to a low power continuous beam, Aeva’s 4D LiDAR has better laser safety margins by design compared to ToF LiDAR approaches that require high power laser pulses. 

 Aeva’s technology also differs from other FMCW LiDAR technologies across multiple areas:
•Point density and maximum range: Aeva’s implementation of an innovative FMCW technology approach breaks the dependency between maximum range and point density, enabling long range capability at high resolutions simultaneously, which has been a critical limitation of other FMCW LiDAR technologies. 
 •Highly scalable laser solution: Aeva’s customized laser solution is fiber-less and based on scalable semiconductor manufacturing processes. 
 •Long range performance: By leveraging our proprietary digital signal processing and our custom integrated photonics technology, Aeva’s technology is designed to achieve superior range performance up to 500 meters. 
 •Low transceiver count: Aeva’s innovative FMCW technology approach allows for a low number of transceivers required to provide high resolution performance across the entire Field of View (“FOV”).
 •Integrated photonics built on proven processes: Aeva’s 4D LiDAR leverages proven semiconductor components integrated on scalable Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (“CMOS”) based silicon photonics processes and does not rely on any exotic materials that are typically challenging to produce in volume. 
 Integrated Silicon Photonics Technology
Built on existing silicon CMOS and III-V technologies and semiconductor manufacturing processes, our solution measures depth, reflectivity and velocity for every pixel.
We believe that our technologies in the field of integrated photonics have the potential to enable 4D LiDAR-on-chip for broad applications:
•Transmitter: Aeva uses its own proprietary semiconductor laser based on an existing low-cost III-V process already in production for telecom applications. Our fiber-less laser solution is power efficient and designed for Aeva’s proprietary signal processing to provide long range performance. 
 

•Detector: Aeva’s custom detector solution is based on existing and scalable semiconductor processes. Low cost photodetectors are integrated on a silicon photonics platform without the use of any exotic materials that are not producible in volume or higher cost detectors used in other LiDARs such as single-photon avalanche diode (“SPAD”) and avalanche photodetectors. 
 •Silicon photonics platform: The core optics of Aeva’s 4D LiDAR is made of silicon photonics technology that brings together an integrated and mass-manufacturable optical sensing module in a compact form factor. 
 Custom Digital Signal Processing ASIC
Aeva’s complex digital signal processing (“DSP”) algorithms have been designed and developed to process the returned optical signal to enable our 4D LiDAR to achieve superior performance across all detectable targets. The result of these DSP algorithms is a high fidelity point cloud of 4D data (3D position as {x,y,z} plus instantaneous velocity) for every pixel.
The custom design of DSP algorithms for Aeva’s ASIC is the result of extensive development and validation of real-world road data, spanning a variety of road types, geographic and environmental conditions over multiple years. Aeva’s proprietary DSP algorithms have been designed to provide the following benefits:
•Optimized detection algorithms custom developed for Aeva’s photonics solution enabling long range performance up to 500 meters; 
 •High point density at low processing power enabled by proprietary detection algorithms that accelerate computationally intensive processing; 
 •Accurate range and velocity measurements for targets across the entire field of view; 
 •Low false alarm rates enables high confidence detections and reliable point cloud data; and 
 •Real-time perception software utilizing 4D point cloud data.
 We believe our custom digital signal processing has the potential to enable a high-performance, low-power ASIC solution that can operate across a variety of environmental conditions while meeting the stringent automotive grade safety and security requirements for production.
4D Perception Software
When combined with Aeva’s powerful perception software, our product allows for fast object detection and classification as well as precision tracking that is essential for a highly automated driving system. In addition, our vehicle state estimation software produces high quality vehicle dynamics and positioning information without the added inertial motion sensing hardware and software typically used in today’s vehicles. 
Object Detection
With Aeva’s instantaneous velocity measurement per pixel, the complex task of finding moving objects such as vehicles, pedestrians and bicycles is not only made simple and precise but also fast. Whereas legacy 3D LiDAR systems require accumulating measurements over several samples to determine if an object is moving, Aeva’s instantaneous velocity measurement per pixel allows the task of detecting moving objects to be executed on a single sample, reducing the reaction time and improving the overall safety of the system.
Object Classification and Tracking
We believe our products can enhance our detection capabilities to track and classify dynamic detected objects using 4D LiDAR’s instant velocity data.
 

Vehicle State Estimation
Through the instantaneous measurement of velocity, Aeva’s 4D LiDAR can produce high quality estimates of vehicle positioning and dynamic properties such as velocity, acceleration, and rate of turn. Whereas high quality vehicle state estimation can be obtained today with expensive hardware solutions such as fiber optic based gyroscopes and high precision inertial motion sensors, Aeva’s 4D LiDAR as an edge device can provide high quality and precise estimates without the use of any additional hardware, thereby further reducing the requirements and costs of such additional hardware. These high quality estimates can be used to produce high fidelity 3D maps of the environment and inform the vehicle computer about the current dynamics state of the vehicle.
Ground Segmentation and Lane Detection
With Aeva’s precise static pixel measurement, the task of estimating where the ground lies in front of the vehicle to determine drivable regions is straightforward. This information can be used by the vehicle to determine drivable regions and lane markings on the road.
Aeva 4D LiDAR vs. Other Sensing Technologies
Machine perception has evolved from using basic vision sensors to multiple sensing solutions each complementing the other’s capability to provide new capability and safe function. Today’s machines utilize the following sensing inputs for perception function: color, velocity, depth, reflectivity and inertial motion. While each current sensing technology has varying capabilities to measure some of these input requirements, we believe that Aeva’s 4D LiDAR technology combine key advantages across all requirements. Below is a comparison of Aeva’s 4D LiDAR technology and other existing solutions today.
 While we believe Aeva’s 4D LiDAR technology meets the requirements of perception function for automated driving and beyond, other sensing technologies have certain advantages.
For example, other sensing technologies, such as cameras and Radar, represent well-established and well-understood technologies. Cameras can measure higher resolution color information compared to LiDAR technology, which is advantageous in certain circumstances, for example, when reading traffic lights. Radars operate in the radio frequencies and thus can better measure through severe weather conditions where an optical sensor such as camera or LiDAR have visibility limitations. Additionally, Radar and camera technologies, as well as certain legacy LiDARs, have been deployed in certain production vehicles, while Aeva’s products are not yet mass produced.
Camera
Cameras can measure color at high resolution and can also be used to infer depth. However, cameras inherently cannot measure depth, velocity, reflectivity, or inertial motion, which are all essential for the function of assisted driving systems (“ADAS”) and autonomous driving applications. Monocular cameras, or commonly known as 2D cameras, are the primary sensing component in today’s ADAS systems. Distance calculations in these camera systems are approximations based on software algorithms but are not based on actual direct measurements of depth. The primary use of cameras for automotive applications today is in lane keep assist, automatic high beam control, and traffic sign recognition as well as use in adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking when combined with other technologies. Binocular cameras, commonly known as 3D cameras, use two cameras to provide the same functionality of 2D cameras but leverage software algorithms to infer depth estimation at short distances.
Despite camera performance limitations, which include poor visual performance across different environmental conditions and lack of velocity detection and accurate measurement of distance, cameras are low in cost and thus their use in current production vehicles is common. However, a number of Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier-1 suppliers have developed camera systems with additional components to overcome inherent camera technology shortfalls that come at the expense of increased cost and complexity.
Radar
Radar is a sensing system that uses radio waves to determine various properties of objects. Radar applications were first introduced to passenger vehicles for consumer use over 20 years ago and radar is considered a mature technology. There are three typical major classes of automotive radar systems today: short-range radar, medium-range radar, and long-range radar. Short-range radar is used for collision proximity warning and safety and enables limited parking assist features. Medium-range radar watches the corners of the vehicle, performs blind spot detection, and observes other-vehicle lane cross over and helps avoid side/corner collisions. Long-range radar is a forward-looking sensor used for adaptive cruise control and early collision detection at far ranges.
Radar systems measure velocity and depth albeit at much lower resolution and precision across a variety of environmental and lighting conditions. Radar does not meet other reflectivity, color and inertial motion perception requirements.
Legacy 3D Time-of-Flight LiDAR
Legacy LiDAR is based on ToF technology and can measure depth and reflectivity. ToF LiDAR measures the distance between a sensor and an object based on the time difference between the emission of a laser pulse signal and its return to the sensor when reflected from the object. In ideal conditions, ToF LiDAR can accurately measure distances in a complete scene with a single laser pulse.
However, because ToF systems measure power directly at the detector, they typically suffer from multiple limitations:
•Susceptible to interference: ToF sensors compete with other sources of optical power (e.g. sunlight and other LiDAR beams) and therefore are subject to inference. 
 •High optical power: ToF LiDAR systems need higher-powered laser pulses to achieve better performance and overcome other interference sources.
 •Can’t directly measure velocity: ToF technology cannot measure pixel velocity instantaneously. ToF systems need multiple measurements to estimate the velocity of an object. 
 •Higher cost and low scalability: High performance ToF LiDARs have a higher component count and/or are fiber based which can make them more costly and challenging to scale due to complex manufacturing techniques. 
 Almost all LiDAR systems in the market today are based on legacy ToF technology and face similar limitations highlighted above.
Our solutions and products
We provide perception solutions that enable our customers to see the world around them more clearly and in new ways. We believe that our products, based on Aeva’s proprietary 4D LiDAR technology have the potential to enable a diverse set of perception applications.
We have two primary product offerings for different market applications:
•a 4D LiDAR solution, consisting of our 4D LiDAR sensing system with embedded software targeted towards automotive, industrial, and security applications; and
 •a silicon photonics engine, and software algorithms, for industrial automation, consumer electronics and consumer health applications. 
 Our solutions are generally expected to be incorporated into final products such as automobiles, industrial equipment and consumer devices. We expect that, after a rigorous, multi-year product design and engineering validation process, customers would select our solutions to be designed into specific final product models, and our solutions would be sold at agreed rates per unit for the lifetime of the customer’s product programs.


Within the automotive sector, we expect our 4D LiDAR solution to be integrated into the vehicle as part of the vehicle integration and production processes to provide perception sensing capability as part of the vehicle’s overall autonomous driving stack. We expect our 4D LiDAR solutions to be compatible for integration into passenger vehicles, trucks and new mobility vehicle platforms, and we are engaged with customers in each of these categories for the potential integration of our solutions into such vehicle platforms.
Within industrial applications, we expect our 4D LiDAR solution would be incorporated as part of an industrial automation platform solution (such as industrial metrology products or cargo moving robots used for factory automation). Within security applications, we expect our 4D LiDAR solution would be incorporated as part of security monitoring systems that may use other sensing and computer electronics systems. We expect to leverage the synergies of our supply chain and manufacturing counterparties within automotive applications to sell our solutions directly to industrial automation companies that develop manufacturing automation solutions for other industrial companies and to manufacture and distribute our products using our existing manufacturing counterparties.

We believe that our innovative products can improve safety, reduce development effort of perception software and reduce costs of autonomous driving systems. In addition, we believe that our solutions solve perception problems across a broad set of market applications, including the automotive, consumer electronics, consumer health, industrial automation and security markets.
Automotive
The automotive industry is undergoing a transformative change towards autonomy that is driven by fundamental shifts in consumer behavior as well as an industry response to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives. Rising safety and security concerns, increasing demand for a more reliable transportation system, and transition from car ownership to “Mobility as a Service”, are expected to also increase the demand for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.
Advanced driver-assistance systems — Level 1 and Level 2
Passenger cars. Growth in population, urbanization, and rising disposable income have driven higher demand for passenger cars. The autonomous passenger car industry is expected to see steady growth as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Currently, Level 1 passenger vehicles still account for a majority of the global autonomous passenger vehicles market, but automotive OEMs are collaborating with technology providers to provide Level 2 ADAS systems for passenger cars.


Autonomous driving — Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5
Autonomous trucking. The autonomous trucking industry is expected to grow rapidly, with North America currently the largest market, and other geographies such as Europe and Asia still in the early stages of adoption. Growing demand from the logistics and construction sectors and growth from other industrial sectors have contributed to the expansion of the autonomous trucking industry. Additionally, more stringent government rules and safety considerations have also generated demand for automated driving technology in this sector. Many truck OEMs are partnering with AD technology manufacturing companies to produce autonomous truck systems. Suppliers of top truck OEMs have also collaborated with several technology companies to develop autonomous systems.
We believe the autonomous trucking industry has the potential to rely heavily on high performance long range LiDAR sensing solutions for the detection of objects at long distance in order to provide safe braking distance and otherwise achieve safe automated driving functionality on the highway. We believe Aeva 4D LiDAR’s long range and fast detection capability can position us to provide attractive solutions for this market.
Passenger cars. We expect the transition to Level 3, Level 4 and eventually Level 5 vehicles to be a significant factor for our growth. Autonomous passenger cars depend on several types of automotive sensors such as camera, radar, and LiDARs, along with comprehensive software technology solutions to provide automated driving function such as highway automation and urban self-driving functionality. We believe automotive OEMs and Tier 1s will continue to partner with the most advanced technology companies to implement the best sensing perception systems that enable safe automated driving function at production scale.
New mobility. Over the past several years, a number of emerging mobility and technology players have entered into the autonomous driving market with a vision to develop fully autonomous vehicles. This segment has experienced substantial investments in research and development in anticipation of the roll-out of driverless mobility services to consumers. Some players, such as Waymo, Uber, Nuro and Zoox, have focused their research and development efforts on developing Level 4 and Level 5 robo-taxis for the delivery of people and goods. Additionally, autonomous technology providers collaborate with automotive OEMs and Tier 1 component providers to develop autonomous vehicles.
Consumer devices
Consumer electronics
We believe Aeva’s 4D LiDAR-on-chip technology has the potential to be utilized in consumer devices such as phones, tablets and smart glasses for various perception applications, including 3D mapping and AR/VR. The application of new sensing input devices used in consumer electronics is expected to continue to grow as innovations help drive down costs and increase performance of consumer electronics devices. AR/VR technology has the potential to be a significant source of demand for the consumer electronics industry. Several major product manufacturers and consumer electronics technology companies have been increasingly public about development of AR/VR feature sets in their next generation consumer electronics products. We believe LiDAR is capable of enabling new use cases for these applications, and some of the largest technology companies have already implemented LiDAR sensing technologies in their phone and tablet devices. The consumer electronics devices market is highly competitive with a few major players dominating the market, including Samsung, Apple and Huawei.
Consumer health
We believe that Aeva’s 4D LiDAR has the potential to enable new applications within the consumer health market, including for contactless health monitoring. Specifically, we see potential future opportunities within consumer healthcare devices where the demand is growing for non-invasive, accurate and low-power sensors that can monitor relevant vital signs such as pulse rate and respiration rate. Longer-term, there may be additional opportunities for our 4D LiDAR to be used in broader consumer health applications such as heart health monitoring and other home-based digital healthcare equipment.


Industrial automation
As manually intensive tasks become more automated, we believe the opportunity for our sensing solutions in industrial workplaces has the potential to expand. Aeva’s 4D LiDAR technology has the potential to offer robots, industrial metrology machines and other automation equipment as a way to perceive their surroundings in a more clear, accurate and cost-effective manner.
The growth of automation poses numerous benefits for industrial applications, including increased efficiency, lower labor costs, and enabling workers to allocate their time to more productive tasks. We believe that some of the same benefits that our 4D LiDAR technology provides for automotive safety applications are beneficial for increasing safety and improving production efficiencies in industrial manufacturing and factory automation environments.
Competition
Given the emerging nature of the automated driving industry and other industries where LiDAR solutions are applicable, there are a number of companies developing LiDAR technologies for automotive, industrial and other applications, including companies developing ToF LiDAR solutions and LiDAR solutions that may be similar to ours. In addition, certain automotive players may have their own internal LiDAR development programs. We believe a significant portion of these other companies are developing legacy 3D LiDAR systems, all of which utilize some variant of ToF technology architectures which we believe have certain limitations in performance, or require high power or are high cost.
 There may be new companies that are independently developing LiDAR solutions that may be similar to ours. However, we believe that our innovative product design, substantial real world collected road data, intellectual property portfolio together with a strong engineering and operations team provide us with certain advantages.
Contracts and Customers
Thus far, we have generally entered into strategic partnership agreements, development agreements and similar agreements with customers in the automated and autonomous driving industry. Pursuant to these agreements, we have sold or otherwise provided product prototypes and non-recurring engineering services for the purpose of research and development and testing of our customers’ development programs. Since our inception, these types of arrangements have accounted for most of our revenues. More recently, we have entered into production memorandums of understanding, development agreements and similar arrangements with certain of our customers that outline the potential development and commercialization of our products into such customers’ vehicle programs and the utilization of Aeva’s products in such vehicle programs targeted for series production. However, there can be no assurance that any of our customers’ development programs will ever be developed and commercialized, and even if they are, there can be no assurance that we will receive production purchase orders from our customers or that our products will be selected in any such series production vehicle programs.
Intellectual Property
Our success and competitive advantage depends in part upon our ability to develop and protect our core technology and intellectual property. We own a growing portfolio of intellectual property, confidential technical information, and expertise in the development of LiDAR technology, coherent sensing, integrated silicon photonics, algorithms and software.
We have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. The applications cover a broad range of system level and component level aspects of LiDAR technology.


As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 198 pending patent applications worldwide. In addition, we have approximately 4 registered U.S. trademarks and 15 pending U.S. trademark applications. Our patent applications cover a broad range of system level hardware and component level aspects of our key technologies including, among other things, FMCW LiDAR system, integrated photonics, laser solutions and perception software technology.
We also rely on trade secrets, experiences, design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing and exclusivity opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees and consultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments and products in the industry.
Manufacturing Process
Since inception, we have entered into arrangements with third-party manufacturers to develop and manufacture our products for our customers’ development programs. We intend to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers, to commercialize our products for automotive grade production.
We have entered into development agreements, memorandums of understanding and similar agreements with third-party manufacturers that typically include collaborations to develop, assemble, test and distribute our automotive grade 4D LiDAR system to OEMs and automotive customers for their autonomous driving vehicle programs. We intend to utilize our production counterparties’ capabilities for the final assembly and test of our products and to produce our products at global manufacturing plants to provide our 4D LiDAR system, including our 4D LiDAR-on-chip, to our customers.
Research and Development
The markets in which Aeva competes are new and rapidly evolving across hardware and software applications. We invest significant resources into ongoing research and development programs because we believe our ability to grow our market position depends, in part, on innovative technologies that offer a unique value proposition for our customers and differentiation from our competitors.
Our research and development activities occur primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our research and development team is responsible for developing our 4D LiDAR technology, creating new technologies and expanding our LiDAR and perception software solutions’ functionality. The team also designs our 4D LiDAR products, ensures it is designed for manufacturability and conducts required validation and verification activities. The research and development team also partners with our operations and supply chain teams with the goal of developing scalable commercial and reliable manufacturing processes and direct production material procurement and distribution. Our team consists of engineers, technicians, scientists, operators and professionals with experience from a wide variety of the world’s leading sensing, engineering, consumer electronics and automotive organizations.
Sales and Marketing
We take an insight-driven, account-based marketing approach to build and expand our relationships with customers and commercial counterparties. We collect feedback directly from our commercial counterparties to garner insights that help drive our business and products forward.
Government Regulation
At both the federal and state level, the United States has provided a positive legal environment to permit safe testing and development of autonomous functionality. We do not currently anticipate any near-term federal standards that would materially impede the deployment of our products or technology. Some states, however, particularly California and New York, still enforce certain operational or registration requirements for certain autonomous functions. We believe such hurdles will be removed as state regulators gain better experience with the technology. U.S. federal regulations, however, remain largely permissive of deployments of higher levels of safe and responsible autonomous functionality.


Foreign markets such as the EU and China also continue to develop their respective standards to define deployment requirements for higher levels of autonomy in these regions. As the cars that carry our sensors go into production, we will be subject to existing stringent requirements under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, or the Vehicle Safety Act, including a duty to report, subject to strict timing requirements, safety defects with our products. The Vehicle Safety Act imposes potentially significant civil penalties for violations including the failure to comply with such reporting requirements. We are also subject to the existing U.S. Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act, or TREAD, which requires equipment manufacturers, such as us, to comply with “Early Warning” requirements by reporting certain information to the NHTSA, such as information related to defects or reports of injury related to our products. TREAD imposes criminal liability for violating such requirements if a defect subsequently causes death or bodily injury. In addition, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards. Sales into foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations. As the development of federal and state regulation of autonomous machines and vehicles continues to evolve, we may be subject to additional regulatory schemes.
As a LiDAR technology company, we are subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related FDA regulations. These requirements are enforced by the FDA. Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect individuals from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products.
Similarly, we are also subject to trade, customs product classification and sourcing regulations. We are subject to the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that will require us to diligence, disclose and report whether our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products.
Finally, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
Like all companies operating in similar industries, we are subject to environmental regulation, including water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with these rules may include permits, licenses and inspections of our facilities and products.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had 227 full-time employees based primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. A majority of our employees are engaged in research and development and related functions. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
We recognize that attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining diverse talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. We believe that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success as stockholders of the Company. By continuing to foster an engaging work environment and focus on continued improvements to employee retention, we improve our ability to support and protect Aeva's long-term interests. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives.


The Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing information resources, COVID testing, and face masks.
 Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we lease two buildings with approximately 28,000 and 30,000 of square feet, respectively, pursuant to a lease that expires in June 2023 and July 2025, respectively. Our headquarters contains engineering, research and development, assembly and administrative functions. Additionally, we lease approximately 96,000 square feet located in the San Francisco Bay Area for our testing facility. This lease expires in April 2026. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and, should we need additional space, we believe we will be able to obtain additional space on commercially reasonable terms.
 Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company may be involved in actions, claims, suits and other proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including assertions by third parties relating to intellectual property infringement, breaches of contract or warranties or employment-related matters. When it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability for such loss contingencies. The Company’s estimates regarding potential losses and materiality are based on the Company’s judgment and assessment of the claims utilizing currently available information. Although the Company will continue to reassess its reserves and estimates based on future developments, the Company’s objective assessment of the legal merits of any such claims may not always be predictive of the outcome and actual results may vary from the Company’s current estimates.
