--------+---------

SUMMARY
 
Applied Minerals, Inc. (the “Company” or “Applied Minerals” or “we” or “us”) (OTCQB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine in central Utah. From the mine we extract, process, or have processed by a third party, halloysite clay and iron oxide for sale to a range of end markets. We market the minerals directly and through distributors and also under a profit-sharing agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF Corp. (“BASF”).
 
We also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and a third party processor (BASF) to process and enhance our halloysite clay products to improve the performance of our customers’ existing and new products.
 
Halloysite
 Our halloysite clay, which we market under the DRAGONITE™ trade name, is an aluminosilicate mineral with a hollow tubular shape. DRAGONITE can utilize halloysite’s shape, high surface area, and reactivity to add significant functionality to a number of applications.
Iron Oxide
 Our iron oxide, which we market under the AMIRON™ trade name, is a high purity product. We have sold it as an absorbent for hydrogen sulfide gas contained in natural gas.
Sales
 In 2018, we recorded revenues of $4,873,161, of which $4,868,466 was related to sales of DRAGONITE to 22 customers, $1,075 was related to sales of AMIRON to one customer and $3,620 was related to rental revenue of the Company’s water truck to an exploration company. 
 
Characterization of the Mineralization
 
Over the last ten years, the Company has expended significant resources, including commissioning a resource study, to determine the amount, character and mineability of the mineralization of the deposits at the Dragon Mine.
 
Classification for SEC Purposes
 
The Company is classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production. Exploration stage includes all companies that do not have established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Such companies are deemed to be “in the search for mineral deposits.” Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. The mineralization indicated by the resource study (described below) we have commissioned cannot be classified as a reserve for purpose of Industry Guide 7.
 
In 2018, SEC adopted rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. Such rules go into effect in 2021. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the new rules.

Processing Capability
 
In 2017, we entered into a tolling agreement with BASF under which BASF will use a water-based system that will process the Company’s halloysite in accordance with the Company’s specifications, which can include eliminating impurities, such as iron oxide, and surface treating the halloysite to achieve desired effects and functionality. 
 
We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons of mineralization per annum for certain applications.
 
Additionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to processing its halloysite resource.  Such facility can process halloysite using a dry-based, micronizing system. This dry-based system does not eliminate impurities such as iron oxide as effectively as wet processing but is useful in situations where wet processing in not necessary
 
Distribution Channels
 
The Company markets and sells its products directly and through distributors. The Company’s CEO spends a significant amount of his time on sales, marketing and product development. The Director of Sales focuses on the marketing of the Company’s DRAGONITE products. The Company also uses several leading distribution organizations, E.T. Horn, Brandt Technologies, LLC, and Azelis to market its products. The Company has a non-exclusive distribution agreement with a distributor for Taiwan and an exclusive agreement with a distributor for Japan.
 
In October, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF (“Supply Agreement”). The Supply Agreement provides that the Company will sell, to the extent that BASF submits orders, up to 15,000 tons of halloysite to BASF per year and BASF may process and/or treat and will have an exclusive license (a) to sell halloysite on a worldwide basis for use within the following third party markets: (i) paints and coatings; (ii) inks; (iii) rubbers (excludes flame retardant and wire and cable applications); (iv) adhesives; (v) paper, and (vi) ceramic honeycomb catalytic substrates and (b) to sell halloysite to other business units of BASF.
 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY
 
Applied Minerals, Inc. (OTCQB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine from which we can extract halloysite clay and iron oxide, which we then process or have processed and sell. We also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and BASF to engineer and enhance our halloysite clay and iron oxide products to improve the performance of our customers’ existing and new products.
 
The Dragon Mine is a 267-acre property located in central Utah, approximately 70 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
We market our halloysite clay-based line of products under the tradename DRAGONITE. We have marketed our iron oxide line of products under the tradename AMIRON.
 
Halloysite is mined and marketed by other companies, primarily by a French company, Imerys, which owns the other major halloysite mine, which is located in New Zealand.  The halloysite from that mine is sold primarily for use in ceramics and tableware.   When new management came into the Company in 2009, new management decided to focus on new, premium-priced uses of halloysite.  Those premium-priced uses had been, and continue to be, identified typically in published research.  Because the Company is primarily dedicated to new, advanced uses of halloysite that would permit the Company to charge premium prices, the sales and marketing process is one that often takes an extended period of time. The Company’s pricing strategy is opportunistic and if significant competition develops, that strategy could be adversely affected.
 
The Company acquired the Dragon Mine primarily to exploit the mine’s halloysite resources. At the time that the Dragon Mine was acquired, it was assumed that the iron oxide mineralization would be useful only for steelmaking. Given historical price conditions and our method of mining (underground), sales of iron oxide for steelmaking would often not be economic and at best would yield marginal or low profits.  The iron oxide resource at the Dragon Mine has a high content of Fe2O3, The iron oxide is of high chemical purity, possesses high surface area, fine grains, dispersability, good tinting strength, enhanced color saturation, low color variation, and a low level of heavy metals content, high surface area (25 m2/g – 125 m2/g and reactivity.
 
In November, 2015, the Company entered into a $5.0 million agreement to supply a customer its AMIRON iron oxide to be delivered over an 18 month period. The customer used the AMIRON for a specialized catalyst application. The Company agreed not to sell for a five-year period AMIRON to others for such use. In addition, the Company agreed that the customer could order up to 20,000 tons of AMIRON per year during the five-year period. The customer has not purchased any additional AMIRON beyond the $5 million order. The customer can extend the exclusivity for an additional five years if, before the end of the initial five year period, it orders an additional $8 million of AMIRON. If the customer orders the additional $8 million, it can also order up to 20,000 tons of AMIRON per year during the second five-year period.
 
The $5 million sale of AMIRON is the Company’s only material sale of AMIRON.
 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAGON MINE
 
History of the Dragon Mine
 
The Dragon Mine was first mined in the third quarter of the 19th century and has since been mined by various owners and operators. It was mined for iron oxide from the late nineteenth century until approximately 1931 and it was mined for halloysite clay from approximately 1931 to 1976. From 1949 to 1976, the halloysite was sold for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. A fire closed the mine in 1976. No mining took place from 1976 until 2001, at which point the Company leased the property with an option to buy it. The Company purchased the property in 2005.
 
Prior to a change in management in 2009, the Company did relatively little to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine or to identify and exploit markets for the minerals. Since new management was installed in 2009, the Company has used and proposes to continue to use a consulting geologist to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine and management has identified, developed and exploited premium-priced markets for halloysite and, with respect to the single $5 million sale noted above, iron oxide.
 
Resource Development/Exploration Drilling Expenses
 
In 2018 and 2017 the Company spent $195,685 and $508,861, respectively, on exploration and resource development.

More Detailed Description of the Mineralization at the Dragon Mine
 
Clays.Kaolinite and halloysite are clays and members of the kaolin group of clays. Both are aluminosilicate clays. Kaolinite and halloysite are essentially chemically identical, but have different morphologies (shapes). Kaolinite typically appears in plates or sheets. Halloysite, in contrast, typically appears in the shape of hollow tubes. On average, the halloysite tubes have a length in the range of 0.5 - 3.0 microns, an exterior diameter in the range of 50 - 70 nanometers and an internal diameter (lumen) in the range of 15 - 30 nanometers. Formation of halloysite occurs when kaolinite sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers. Halloysite is non-toxic and natural, demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment.
 
Kaolinite is one of the world’s most common minerals. U.S. production in 2016 was approximately 6.1 million tons.
 
Halloysite is, by comparison, a rarer mineral and we believe worldwide production is less than 25,000 tons.
 
Iron Oxide.Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide, which exists in a range of colors, including black to steel or silver-gray and brown to reddish brown, or red.
 
Geothite is an iron hydroxide oxide mineral, which exists in a range of colors, including yellowish to reddish to dark brown. If goethite is sufficiently heated to eliminate its contained water, it is transformed into hematite.
 
Mixtures of goethite and hematite are the color brown.
 
STATUS OF THE COMPANY FOR SEC REPORTING PURPOSES
 
The Company is classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production.
 
Exploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits (that is, reserves), which are not in either the development or production stage. In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, the company must have already established reserves. Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves.

5
-

 

Under Industry Guide 7, a “reserve” is “that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.” Generally speaking, a company may not declare reserves, unless, among other requirements, a competent professional engineer conducts a detailed engineering and economic study and prepares a “bankable” or “final” feasibility study that “demonstrates that a mineral deposit can be mined profitably at a commercial rate.”
 
The Company has commissioned an ongoing study described above that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The mineralization described in the study does not qualify as reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7 
 
In 2018, SEC adopted rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. Such rules go into effect in 2021. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the new rules.
 
Despite the fact that the Company has not established reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7, the Company has mined, processed and sold, and intends to continue to mine, process, and sell halloysite clay and iron oxide from the Dragon Mine.
 
A consequence of the absence of reserves under Industry Guide 7 is that the mining company, such as the Company, is deemed to lack an objective basis to assert that it has a deposit with mineralization that can be economically and legally extracted or produced and sold to produce revenue.
 
In 2016, SEC proposed rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the proposed rules.
 
PROCESSING CAPABILITIES
 
In 2017, we entered into a tolling agreement with BASF Corp. (“BASF”) under which BASF will “wet process” the Company’s halloysite to comply with the Company’s specifications, which can include eliminating impurities such as iron oxide and surface treating to achieve desired effects and functionality.  The tolling agreement provides for tolling up to 15,000 tons per year. The Company has been orally assured that such capacity can be increased as reasonably necessary.
 
We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons per annum for certain applications. The facility can be used for iron oxide or halloysite. It is currently being used for halloysite.
 
Additionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to its halloysite resource.  Such facility can “dry process” halloysite using a micronizing system.  Dry processing does not eliminate impurities such as iron oxide as effectively as wet processing but is useful in situations where wet processing in not necessary.  
 
In October, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF Corp. pursuant to which BASF can purchase up to 15,000 tons per year, which it can process and sell into five specified markets. As of April 16, 2019, no sales of halloysite have been made by the Kaolin business unit.

APPLICATION MARKETS
 
DRAGONITE
 
The following is a description of the application markets in which the Company has commercial customers for halloysite-based DRAGONITE products:
 
Molecular Sieves and Catalysts.
 
Molecular Sieves.  DRAGONITE™ is a binder to zeolite crystals to enhance a molecular sieve’s productivity in critical functions such as drying of natural gas and air, separation of liquid from product streams, and separation of impurities from a gas stream. DRAGONITE possesses a dispersion ability that allows it to combine with the zeolite crystals without reducing the rate of diffusion of liquids and gases. DRAGONITE’s fine particle size, porosity, and thermal stability also ensure that adsorbates diffuse rapidly through the sieve without affecting the adsorbent blend’s physical properties.
Catalysts. DRAGONITE can be used as a catalyst and catalyst support for the hydrotreatment and hydrodemetalation of hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks.  DRAGONITE can be used to remove impurities such as metals, sulfur, nitrogen, and asphaltenes. Crude oil petroleum must be processed in order to make it into gasoline and other fuels.. Catalytic cracking involves the addition of a catalyst to speed up the cracking. The reactive nature of halloysite lends itself to being a catalyst especially for high sulfur oil. Halloysite can also be used as a support for catalysts, which are applied to the halloysite as a coating.
 
Halloysite from the Dragon Mine was mined and processed as a catalyst for petroleum cracking from 1949 to 1976.
 
Flame Retardant Additives
 
Flame retardant additives are widely used in flammable and flame resistant plastics and are found in electronics, building insulation, polyurethane foam, and wire and cable.
 
Plastic manufacturers typically mix or load a small amount of flame retardant into plastic to lower the risk of flammability of their products. We believe that DRAGONITE can be used as a partial replacement for Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and Magnesium Hydroxide (MDH) in certain applications and as a synergist to ATH and MDH in other applications.

8
-

 

At typical loadings, ATH and MDH can adversely affect certain mechanical properties of plastics. We believe that DRAGONITE, in conjunction with ATH and MDH, exhibits a synergistic performance. Our research and development indicates that DRAGONITE can be used to replace 50% - 75% of antimony trioxide (ATO) in plastic without affecting flame retardancy, retaining the same rating under UL 94, the Standard for Safety of Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances testing.
 
We believe that in certain applications the use of DRAGONITE instead of other fire retardant products may allow a manufacturer to use less fire retardant and may, in addition, may enable the manufacturer to reduce the weight of the manufactured part. DRAGONITE-XR does not release its naturally bound water until 400°C, making it suitable for polymers processed under extreme conditions.
 
Other clays compete in the markets for partially replacing ATH, MDH, and ATO.
 
Binders for Ceramics
 
DRAGONITE is an effective binder for traditional ceramic products (any of various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature). Binders are substances that improve the mechanical strength of green ceramic bodies so they can pass through production steps before firing without breakage. We believe that DRAGONITE, when used as a binder, also effectuates an improvement in the casting rate of the ceramic manufacturing process. This would equate to an increase in manufacturing efficiency.
Nucleation of Polymers; Reinforcement of Polymers.
 
Nucleation. Plastics and polymers are composed of long molecular chains that form irregular, entangled coils in a melted resin, the phase in which a resin is liquid and its molecules can move about freely. In semi-crystalline polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), Nylon 6 and Nylon 6-6. Crystallization of a polymer occurs as a result of nucleation, a process that starts with small, nanometer-sized domains upon which the polymer chains arrange in an orderly manner to develop larger crystals. The overall rate of crystallization of a polymer be can increased by a nucleating agent. In plastic molding processes, especially in injection molding, the plastic part must remain in the mold until crystallization is complete (freezing). To the extent that crystallization is accelerated, the time in the mold can be reduced, thereby resulting in productivity enhancement. We believe that DRAGONITE added to a resin at a loading of just 1% can significantly speed up the process of crystallization.
 
We believe DRAGONITE can be effective as a nucleating agent for both polyethylene and polypropylene.
 
Reinforcement Fillers. Many plastics are reinforced with a filler to enhance the mechanical properties of a polymer. Reinforced plastics, in certain instances, can compete with stiffer materials like metal while also offering an opportunity to reduce the weight of a manufactured part (“light-weighting”).
 
We believe that the utilization of DRAGONITE as a reinforcing filler can result in the improvement of one or more mechanical properties of a polymer such as modulus (the measure of how well a polymer resists breaking when pulled apart), strength (the measure of the stress needed to break a polymer), and impact resistance (the measure of a polymer’s resistance when impacted by a sharp and sudden stress).
 
Paints and Coatings
 
Halloysite has been shown to improve the adhesion and impact resistance properties of polymer-based paints and coatings. Additionally, halloysite has been shown to significantly improve the corrosion resistance of paints and coatings over synthetic anti-corrosion agents. Paints and coatings are one of the application markets on which BASF is focused as part of its Supply Agreement with the Company.
Other Opportunities. 
 
Other potential markets that present opportunities for halloysite but as to which the Company does not have commercial customers include cement (halloysite may increase tensile strength more than twice the increase in compressive strength while reducing permeability), batteries (the silicon material in halloysite, which is an aluminasilicate, may be extracted from halloysite and used in anode in lithium ion batteries and halloysite may be used in electrolyte in batteries), and controlled release carrier in cosmetics and in other applications.
AMIRON
 
The AMIRON line of natural iron oxide-based products can be used in technical and pigmentary application markets.  An immaterial amount of sales of AMIRON were made in 2018 and no sales of AMIRON have been made so far in 2019.

THE SALES PROCESS
 
The Company sells its products using employees, agents, and distributors, selling on a global basis.
 
DRAGONITE
 The Company markets its DRAGONITE into two general types of application markets. 
 
The first type is a market in which halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive, to enhance a functionality of an application.  This type of market requires a number of steps to be completed before a sale can be consummated.  Like any new material that will be incorporated into a commercial manufacturing process, a significant amount of testing must be performed by a customer before DRAGONITE can be incorporated into a manufacturing process and a product. Sales of this type often require working with the potential customers’ existing formulations, which can vary from potential customer to potential customer.
 
Working with a potential customer could include identifying a solution, such as (i) surface coating or (ii) when to introduce DRAGONITE into the formulation or (iii) the conditions under which it should be introduced or (iv) changes, deletions, additions, or substitutions involving other elements of the customer’s formulation. Without the customer’s collaboration in identifying a solution, DRAGONITE could be unsuccessful in achieving the customer’s goals. This process can take an extended period of time (years in the case of discoloration of polymers as a result of the introduction of DRAGONITE) and, in some cases, there is no solution. In this type of market, price can be an important consideration and in some cases, we are not able to compete.
 
The second type of market is one in which halloysite clay is currently being used in traditional application markets.  Within these established markets, we believe our DRAGONITE products often offers an enhanced value proposition with respect to purity and other properties sought by customers, although in some cases DRAGONITE’s purity and/or other properties may not be required or useful.  The pricing of our products relative to those of our competitors, however, will always be a significant factor in determining our ability to penetrate these markets.
 
AMIRON
 The Company encounters the same types of challenges marketing AMIRON, as it faces in marketing DRAGONITE. In particular, the Company must compete on price and quality in relation to competitive materials.
 
The Company is not currently devoting significant efforts or resources to marketing AMIRON. It cannot be assured that we will be successful in penetrating markets for AMIRON.
 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
 
The Company’s research and development and testing efforts are focused on the continued creation of commercial applications for our halloysite-based products and our iron oxides. The Company conducts research and development efforts internally and occasionally through consultants. The Company is using BASF to conduct research. The Company also conducts product research and development collaboratively with distributors, customers and potential customers.
 
In 2018 and 2017, the Company spent $0 and  $170,407 for testing and research, respectively.
 
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
 
We have trademarked the name DRAGONITE and AMIRON. We believe these trademarks are important to the successful marketing of our product offering.
 
REGULATION
 
The Utah Department of Natural Resources sets the guidelines for exploration and other mineral related activities based on provisions of the Mined Land Reclamation Act, Title 40-8, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, and the General Rules and Rules of Practice and Procedures, R647-1 through R647-5. We have received a large mine permit from the Department.  The Company does not believe that such regulations, including environmental regulations, have or will adversely affect the Company’s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
 

We carry a Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) license (#4202383) for the Dragon Mine and report as required to MSHA. The Company is subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which was created by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The regulations generally are designed to assure the health and safety of miners and our mine is periodically inspected by MSHA.  The Company does not believe that such regulations have or will materially adversely affect the Company’s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
 
The clays that the Company mines, including halloysite, may contain various levels of crystalline silica when mined.  Crystalline silica is considered a hazardous substance under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and U.S. Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) and as a result is subject to permissible exposure limits (PELs), both in the mine and at the workplaces of our customers.  The Company is required to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) at the mine and accompanying sales of products to customers. The Company must also apply hazard warning to labels of containers of the product sold to customers, if levels of crystalline silica are present above specified thresholds.  Kaolin and halloysite are also subject to PELs.
