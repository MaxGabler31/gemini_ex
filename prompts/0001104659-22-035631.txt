Item 1. Business
Overview
The Corporation was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on February 22, 2011 under the name “Midas Gold Corp.” The Corporation changed its name to “Perpetua Resources Corp.” on February 15, 2021.
The Corporation’s head office is located at Suite 201 – 405 South 8th Street, Boise, Idaho, U.S.A. 83702 and its registered and records office is located at Suite 400 – 725 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1G5.
The Corporation is a development-stage company engaged in acquiring mining properties with the intention of exploring, evaluating and placing them into production, if warranted. Currently, its principal business is the exploration and, if warranted and subject to receipt of required permitting, redevelopment, restoration and operation of the Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho, USA (the "Project" or "Stibnite Gold Project"). The Corporation is currently undertaking an extensive permitting process for redevelopment and restoration of the Project.
Mineral exploration and development are expected to constitute the principal business of the Corporation for the coming years. In the course of realizing its objectives, it is expected the Corporation may enter into various agreements specific to the mining industry, such as purchase or option agreements to purchase mining claims and/or joint venture agreements.
The Corporation’s principal mineral project is the Stibnite Gold Project, which contains several gold, silver and antimony mineral deposits. The Corporation’s current focus is to explore, evaluate and potentially redevelop three of the deposits known as the Hangar Flats Deposit, West End Deposit and Yellow Pine Deposit, all of which are located within the Stibnite Gold Project as well as reprocess certain historical tailings located on the Project. These development activities would be undertaken in conjunction with a major restoration program designed to address impacts related to historical activities in the Project area.
The Corporation’s subsidiaries’ property holdings at the Stibnite Gold Project are comprised of a contiguous package of unpatented federal lode claims, unpatented federal mill sites, patented lode mining claims and patented mill sites. As of December 31, 2021, this land position encompassed approximately 11,548 hectares held in 1,518 unpatented lode claims and mill sites and patented land holdings. A subsidiary of the Corporation acquired these rights through a combination of purchases and transactions and staking under the 1872 Mining Law and holds a portion under an option agreement. Bureau of Land Management claim rental payments and filings are current as of the date of this filing and the claims are all held in good standing. Normal maintenance and upkeep of the Project infrastructure continued during the year.

Corporate Structure
The following chart shows the intra-corporate relationships between the Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. (“PRII”) has no ownership interest in the Stibnite Gold Project; rather, it is the operating entity and manages the activities on the Project site. The property holding entity, Idaho Gold Resources Company, LLC (“IGRCLLC”), is the surviving entity in a merger with Stibnite Gold Company (“SGC”) effective June 3, 2021 and is managed pursuant to an operating agreement by PRII. PRII and IGRCLLC are wholly owned by the Corporation.

​
IGRCLLC holds title to the Yellow Pine, Hangar Flats, and West End deposits, all of the patented mill sites and all of the unpatented federal lode mining claims and unpatented mill sites.
Recent Developments
Perpetua Resources has determined that it no longer qualifies as a “foreign private issuer” as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2022, the Company is required to, among other things, (i) file periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC and (ii) comply with U.S. proxy requirements with respect to solicitation materials, including those relating to the Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Permitting and Environmental Matters
Perpetua Resources focuses on the exploration and mining of the Stibnite Gold Project, the reclamation of prior deposits and historical tailings, and the restoration of the area to address historical activities and legacy contamination. Our project is, therefore, subject to a number of environmental regulations, including federal, state, and local laws. Significantly, we are subject to formal review under NEPA and extensive permitting requirements. In 2016, the Forest Service began its formal review of the Stibnite Gold Project under NEPA. The Forest Service completed scoping in 2017 and from late 2020 through 2021, pursuant to the NEPA process, the United States Forest Service and cooperating agencies undertook extensive review of our project and proposed actions through a Draft Environmental Impact Statement. As a result of public comment and continued NEPA review, we anticipate the circulation of a preliminary Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (“SDEIS”) for cooperating agency review in the second quarter of 2022, with public release shortly thereafter in the third quarter of 2022. We continue to work on obtaining the required ancillary permits during this time.

Our project is subject to ongoing litigation and could face further litigious challenges in the future. To address historical legacy impacts at the site of the Stibnite Gold Project, Perpetua Resources has voluntarily entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”) with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) and the United States Department of Agriculture, pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Finalized on January 15, 2021, the ASAOC provides for a number of time critical removal actions (early cleanup actions) designed to improve water quality in several areas of the site. Upon signing of the ASAOC, the aggregate cost of the obligation was estimated to be approximately $7,473,805. In 2021, the total cost estimate to voluntarily address environmental conditions increased to $12,198,651. As of December 31, 2021, the corresponding environmental liability was estimated to be $9,888,200. See also Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Government and Environmental Regulations
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, disclosure requirements and other matters. Perpetua Resources plans to obtain the licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct its exploration or development programs and believes that it is currently in material compliances with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in the United States and Idaho. Except as otherwise noted above, we are not subject to any orders or directions with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. For a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations, see section Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.
Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations may require us to take precautions with respect to threatened, endangered, or otherwise protected species and their habitat as well as other natural, historical, and cultural resources, perform environmental assessments or impact statements, implement siting and operational programs or best practices to minimize environmental impacts from our operations, perform investigatory remedial obligations, and obtain federal, state, and local permits, licenses, or other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of significant fines or penalties. Additionally, we could experience significant opposition from third parties to our application for such permits or during the administrative agency review and appeal process after the issuance of such permits. Delays or denial of permits, or the imposition of costly and difficult to comply with conditions, may impair the development of our project or curtail our planned operations. The following provides a summary of the more significant environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations which our operations are subject to and for which compliance with may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Our project is subject to environmental review under NEPA. The federal law requires agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment and can include the granting of a permit or similar authorization for the development of certain projects. As part of the review, agencies are required to consider numerous environmental impacts, such as impacts on air quality, water quality, cultural resources, wildlife, geology, aesthetics, as well as alternatives to the project. The review process can lead to significant delays in approval of such projects and the issuance of the requisite permits which, in turn, can impact both the cost and development of operations. As a result of NEPA review, agencies may decide to deny permits or other support for a project, or condition approvals on certain modifications or mitigation actions. Additionally, authorizations under NEPA are subject to litigation, protest, or appeal, which has the potential to lead to further delays.
Pursuant to NEPA, the United States Forest Service and cooperating agencies undertook extensive review of our project and proposed actions. As a result of this review, an SDEIS is anticipated for public release in the third quarter of 2022. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The site upon which our project is located has significant legacy contamination. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are statutorily responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include current owners or operators of a site where a release has occurred. Under CERCLA, such current owners or operators may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the entire cost of cleaning up hazardous substances and for other expenditures, such as response costs and damage to natural resources. Idaho also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA.

Voluntary early cleanup actions can be undertaken pursuant to settlement agreements under CERCLA. We have entered into the ASAOC with the U.S. EPA and the United States Department of Agriculture to conduct a number of timely critical removal actions focused on improving water quality in several areas of the site. 
Protection of Species and Habitat
Our operations are subject to several environmental regulations and guidelines regarding various protected species and their habitats and include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, alongside similar state laws. These laws impose significant civil and criminal penalties for violations, including injunctions limiting or otherwise prohibiting operations in certain areas where protected species or their habitat is located. The imposition of such restrictions, such as seasonal limitations, may result in additional costs and delays and could impact the feasibility of our project. 
Clean Water Act 
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and other similar federal and state laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits for water discharges or take mitigation actions with respect to loss of wetlands. Additionally, such regulations require us to implement a variety of best management practices to ensure that water quality is protected and the impacts of our operations are minimized. The CWA and analogous laws and regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of addressing such discharges. 
Mine and Safety Health Administration 
Mining operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine and Safety Health Administration (“MSHA”) which carries out the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. MSHA enforces the health and safety rules for all U.S, mines and includes mine inspections regarding compliance with applicable laws and regulations. MSHA has the ability to issue citations and orders and assess penalties for health and safety violations.
District Exploration
No drilling was completed during the reporting period. Activities during the reporting period focused on studies to support permitting and design, engineering and environmental studies to support the ongoing activities related to the ASAOC.
Employees
At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had 31 full time employees and 1 part time employee. 29 employees were directly related to the mineral development activities of the Stibnite Gold Project and the remaining 3 employees were focused on executive management and administrative support of the Corporation. A total of 28 employees were employed in Idaho; however, in 2021, most of the Perpetua Resources team continued working remotely, when possible, to support a safer workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Corporation also contracts out certain activities with specific skills to assist with various aspects of the Project.
Competition
The gold exploration and mining business is a competitive business. The Corporation competes with numerous other companies possessing greater financial and technical research resources. Competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable undeveloped gold properties. In addition, we also encounter competition for the hiring of key personnel. This competition could adversely impact our ability to advance the Project, acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future on terms we consider acceptable, attract necessary capital funding or acquire an interest in additional properties.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
Our commitment to ESG practices is a core part of our business and has been since our inception, as formalized by our ESG Policy. Our operations are guided by responsible and sustainable mining practices and incorporate strong corporate governance values and stakeholder engagement. We engage regularly with key stakeholders and other interested parties, which allows us to better understand their interests, perspectives, and needs. We also believe in both transparency and accountability as key attributes of our governance strategy and seek to deliver information in an open and consistent manner, as denoted by our Environmental, Social Responsibility and Good Governance Report released in 2020. Our commitment to ESG is also incorporated into our conservation principles which govern the development of our Project and, ultimately, our operations. 
Both our ESG Policy and our 2020 Environmental, Social Responsibility and Good Governance Report can be found on the Company’s website.
Availability of Raw Materials
The raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in the United States and Canada. Historically, we have been able to secure the appropriate equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
Gold Price History
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand, in addition to international and national political and economic conditions. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily afternoon London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”) gold price over the past five calendar years on the London Bullion Market ($/ounce):
