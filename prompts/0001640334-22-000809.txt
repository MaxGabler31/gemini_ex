Item 1. Business

Since January 30, 2017, following a change of control, we have been engaged in the business of developing and marketing nutritional products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle. Our business to date has involved the purchase of products from three suppliers in the Republic of China (Taiwan). We sell product in bulk to companies who may use our products as ingredients in their products or sell the products they purchase from us to their own customers. All of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were made to one customer, and all of these sales were made in the first quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019.

Substantially all of our sales to date have been sales of cordyceps related products.  Cordyceps is a fungus that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis has been described as a medicine in old Chinese medical books and Tibetan medicine. It is a rare combination of a caterpillar and a fungus and found at altitudes above 4500m in Sikkim. We may also seek to market other products which we see as complimentary to our present products; however, we have not entered into negotiations with respect to the distribution of other products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to market any other products. In the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we sold metallothionein MT-3 elizer.  We do not presently sell metallothionein MT-3 elizer, and we do not consider it part of our business.   

We believe that our failure to sell products during the last nine months of 2020 resulted substantially from the COVID – 19 pandemic and actions taken by governments to address the pandemic. We believe our failure to generate sales reflects a downturn in the market in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) for cordyseps products, and we cannot assure you that the market will improve. We also cannot assure you the political instability in Hong Kong will not affect our sales, since our customers in 2017 and 2018 were Hong Kong-based customers who sold their products in the PRC, and none of these customers has made purchases from us since the 2018. We cannot assure you that these factors will not affect our ability to generate revenues in the future and, to the extent that any of these factors affects our ability to generate revenue, we may not be able to continue in business.

During 2021, we sold Cordycepin and cordyceps powder to three customers, who accounted for 58.5%, 3.2% and 8.3%, respectively.  During 2020 we sold Cordycepin and cordyceps powder to one customers, who was our 8.3% customer in 2021.  All sales during the 2020 were made in the first quarter of the year, and we did not have any sales during the second, third or fourth quarter of the year. We purchased all of our Cordycepin and cordyceps powder from one supplier for 2020.  We did not purchase any inventory in 2021.  Our sales are sales of our product in bulk to companies who may use our products as ingredients in their products or sell the products they purchased from us to their own customers.

Implications of Having Been an Emerging Growth Company

We ceased being an Emerging Growth Company on December 31, 2021, the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering.  Since we completed our initial public offering in 2016, we ceased to be an emerging growth company after December 31, 2021.  However, as long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we will be able to take advantage of most of the reduced reporting requirements.  We will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we have either (i) a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million and a public float of less than $700 million.
Our Organization

We are a Nevada corporation incorporated on September 24, 2014 under the name Killer Waves Hawaii, Inc. On January 30, 2017, we changed our corporate name to Acro Biomedical Co., Ltd. Our address is 12175 Visionary Way, Suite 1160, Fishers, Indiana 46038, telephone (317) 286-6788. Our corporate website is http://acrobiomedicalco.com. Information on or derived from our website or any other website is not part of this annual report.
Our Business and Proposed Business

To date, all of our sales were made by our chief executive officer, who is our only employee. We plan to develop a marketing program pursuant to which we will seek to:

· | market raw materials to customers, primarily in Hong Kong, who would either sell our products or use our products as an ingredient on their products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | enter into agreements with customers pursuant to which we would develop and supply products which include our ingredients and which meet the specifications of the customer; 
· | develop one or more products which we would sell to retail outlets which would sell our products to their customers or sell the products directly to retail customers as on-line sales.

We do not presently have either a marketing staff or any manufacturing facilities.  The only product currently in development is our proposed cordyceps-infused chicken feed.  If we can develop a product which can be marketed in a quantity sufficient to enable us to generate an operating profit from the product, we intend to develop a marketing staff by hiring a marketing manager and engaging independent sales representatives or hiring sales and marketing and sales personnel or a combination of independent representatives and sales staff. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the product or engage the necessary qualified personnel or to implement an effective marketing program.

Initially, we intend to focus on marketing our products to companies in the Hong Kong and Republic of China markets. To date all of our sales have been sales of products which we purchased from our suppliers. In order to market products which would be based our or our customer’s specifications, we would need to provide our potential customers with evidence that we have the capacity to develop and manufacture the products that meet both the customer’s quality specifications and delivery requirements and comply with all government requirements. Since we anticipate that the products we sell will be marketed as over the counter health supplements, both the manufacturing facility, the product and the marketing materials would have to comply with all applicable government regulations in the country in which the products are sold.

We do not presently have any manufacturing operations. To the extent that we obtain purchase orders for products, we would need to negotiate an agreement with a qualified manufacturer acceptable to the customer that can deliver the products in accordance with the customer’s specifications, including any required product warranties, and all applicable government regulations and at the customer’s cost set forth in the purchase order. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate any orders for products until and unless we have shown the ability to produce and deliver products of the type that the customer. 

At present, we do not market products for retail sale. We may seek to develop our own proprietary products or we may have a supplier provide us with their products on a private label basis or we may sell a manufacturer’s brand. We cannot assure you that we can develop products, obtain products on a private-label basis or sell any products at retail. To the extent that we are selling products to consumers, whether directly through the Internet, or through retail outlets, we will need to comply with all applicable government regulations in each country in which we sell the products. In this connection, we are considering marketing products in the United States. If we sell products in the United States, we plan to sell products through distributors who sell other non-prescription products and who will be responsible for compliance with the applicable regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). We also plan to market our products using the internet through a website that we plan to set up.  As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any distribution agreements and we have not established a website.  We cannot assure you that we will be successful in establishing any marketing program or establishing a website in the United States or elsewhere or that any website we establish will generate significant, if any, business.

Our initial product development work relates to the development of a cordyceps-infused chicken feed and the inspection, analysis and comparison of the nutritional components of eggs that are laid by chickens that are fed cordyceps-infused chicken feed. We are formulating a marketing plan for cordyceps-based chicken feed. In order to be successful, we would need to satisfy chicken farmers that the use of cordyceps-infused check feed is safe, that there is improved nutrition in the chickens and the eggs and that the cost of the feed is reasonable and that there is a market for eggs laid by chickens that were feed with cordyceps-infused chicken feed. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing a marketable product or that we will generate any significant revenue from this product

In 2021, we engaged consultants to work with us in various aspects of product development and marketing for this product.  Because of our lack of funds, we compensated our consultant through the issuance of stock, primarily pursuant to our 2020 equity incentive plan. We issued 6,776,000 shares of common stock on May 25, 2021 and 5,506,000 shares of common stock on August 23, 2021 to consultants as stock grants pursuant to agreements with the consultants. The agreements provide for the consultants to perform services described in the contracts, which include research and development and marketing services for the two-year period commencing May 25, 2021 and August 23, 2021, respectively. The shares were valued at $31,424,800, based on the market price of the common stock on the respective dates of the agreements and are being amortized over the two-year terms of the consulting agreement.  During 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation of $7,651,417 and at December 31, 2021, we had deferred stock compensation of $23,773,383 which will be recognized over the balance of the terms of the agreement.

The four areas in which we are working on this project are:


· | Cordycepts eggs composition analysis to compare the eggs laid by chickens that used our proposed product with eggs laid by chickens that did not use any special supplements; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Analysis of the chicken after using the product, to determine whether there are any positive or negative effects upon the heath of the chickens that are fed feed with our proposed product as a supplement. 
· | Engineering the feed formula to maximize the potential benefits of the product, including using the data derived from the analysis of the eggs and chickens to modify the product. 
· | Outsourcing production and establishing a quality control staff including obtaining any necessary regulatory approval for our product. This phase would be undertaken if and when we are satisfied that we have a marketable product.


The activities in which our consultants were engaged includes research relating to logistics for delivery and cost and pricing considerations, working with the chicken farmers who are participating in our project including preparing, maintaining and distributing the cordycepts egg packages for use by the farmers, conducting market research as to the buyer’s reactions and insights to the use of this product and market dynamics, designing packaging, developing seasonal product packaging, and seeking to communicate the benefits of the product as part of the package design, engaging in research as to competitor’s software, marketing, pricing and sales programs, as well as conducting marketing and research using the Internet, identifying, qualifying and contacting potential customers.  The consultants also performed preliminary work for the possible international sales, including analyzing appropriate exhibitions and trade shows, assist in the proposed labeling of product to meet regulatory requirements, take steps to insure that ingredients are processed to meet the Taiwan Food and Drug Authority for health supplement certification registration, analyze products to gain assurance that that certified ingredients do not contain contaminants such as heavy metals, microbiological contaminants, pesticides, herbicides and mycotoxins or antibiotics.  The consultants are also reviewing the possibility of patent protection. 

We anticipate that for any products we sell pursuant to an agreement with our customer we will incur liability in the event that the product does not comply with the customer’s specifications or in the event of any product recall. We intend to provide in our agreement with the customer that the customer will be responsible for compliance with all laws applicable to the marketing, sale and labeling of the product. If we sell any products at retail, whether through the Internet or through retail outlets, it will be our responsibility to comply with all government regulations relation to manufacture, marketing, sale and labeling of the products. We will also incur liability in the event of any product recall. The cost of any liability which we may incur may be significant and, if we are found to be liable for any product noncompliance or product recall, we may not be able to continue in business.

Our business plan is in the preliminary stages, and we will require significant funding to implement our business plan, with no assurance that we can or will be successful in developing and implementing our business plan. If we are not able to implement our business plan, our business may be materially impaired.

Source of Supply

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased inventory of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder, from one supplier, Aublog Inc., a Taiwan-based company. We did not purchase any inventory during 2021, and we had no inventory at December 31, 2021. The cordyceps that we are using in the development of our chicken feed product, which is the same product that we sell for human consumption, was taken from our inventory and the cordyceps used in the development project was not significant.

We do not plan to establish manufacturing facilities. We have engaged in initial discussions with potential contract manufacturers in Taiwan but, as of the date of this annual report, we do not have a formal or informal understanding with any contract manufacturer.  If we are able to negotiate acceptable terms for a contract manufacturer to manufacture our products, we would source the raw materials and have the raw materials shipped to the manufacturer who would them customize the product to meet our or our customer’s specifications. However, any product that we may sell may bear the brand names of the manufacturer rather than our brand name. If we are not able to negotiate an agreement with a contract manufacturer, we may buy finished products from a manufacturer, which we anticipate would have the manufacturer’s brand names. Even if we engage a contract manufacturer, we may still buy a manufacturer’s brand products either from our contract manufacturer or another supplier. Our ability to negotiation a contract with a supplier may be affected by both the modest level of sales for the year as well as our lack of substantial sales. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary relationships with suppliers or contract manufacturers on reasonable terms. Our inability to enter into an agreement with a contract manufacturer may materially impair our ability to implement our business plan.  

Marketing and Sales

All of our marketing and sales activities to date have been conducted by our chief executive officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who is our only employee and who provides his services on a part-time basis. All sales to date were made by Mr. Chu. If we develop a product, including our proposed corcyceps infused chicken feed, we would need to develop a distribution network. 

During 2021, we had three customers, Golden Biomedium Co., Ltd., a Taiwan-based company, Vista Global Biotech Limited, a Hong Kong-based company, and King Life Biotech Co., Ltd, a Taiwan-based company, which accounted for 33.2%, 58.5% and 8.3%, respectively, of our revenues.   For 2020 King Life Biotech Co. Ltd. was our sole customer, and our sales to King Life Biotech in 2021 were in the first quarter.  We do not have any long-term contracts with any customer. We ship products pursuant to purchase orders placed by the customers. 

Effects of COVID-19

Since our products are purchased by customers in Taiwan and Hong Kong either as one ingredient of a product to be sold to their customers in China or for resale to their customers, our business may be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as it effects manufacturers in Taiwan and Hong Kong and their customers in China. We believe that our failure to generate sales in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021 significantly resulted from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and these factors may continue to affect our ability to sell our products. Factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic which may affect the market for our products include, but are not limited to, the following.


· | The effect of COVID-19 on the ability of our customers and potential customers to manufacture products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The financial health of our potential customers; 
· | Since our customers may use our products as an ingredient in their products, the ability of the customer to obtain other ingredients may affect their willingness or ability to purchase our product.
· | The ability of our customers to ship their products to China and the ability of their customers to distribute product to retail markets; 


9


· | The willingness or ability of the ultimate purchaser in China to purchase products with our ingredients and their perception as to whether the products may have beneficial effects to them; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The extent to which quarantine affects the willingness or ability of consumers to purchase products with our ingredients; 
· | The perceived benefit, if any, to consumers of products with our ingredients; 
· | If we seek to market our product in the United States, our ability or the ability of our distributors to comply with, and the effects of, all applicable laws and regulations adopted to address the pandemic in the United States; 
· | The extent to which the purchase or products with our ingredients is a low priority item for a population whose disposable income may have decreased as a result of COVID-19 and the steps taken by the Chinese government to curb the spread of infection.

Government Regulations

In the event that we seek to market and sell our products in the United States, we will be subject to various laws and regulations. The United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a dietary ingredient as a vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, amino acid, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases, which means that supplements cannot make claims as to health benefits. Claims like these can only legitimately be made for drugs, not dietary supplements. Dietary supplements include such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes. Dietary supplements are marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, powders, and liquids. Cordyceps is considered a dietary supplement.

The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering “conventional” foods and drug products. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. That means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and FDA regulations. The FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market.

The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. However, the reporting of an event is not an admission that the product caused the adverse event.

If we engage in business in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of other regulations, including those relating to health, safety, bioterrorism, environmental, cybersecurity, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and environmental. These regulations may require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will able to be in compliance.

We do not presently sell products for retail sale to consumers although we may, to the extent that we implement our proposed business plan, develop products which are designed and packaged for consumer use. Our customers presently purchase our products in bulk and may use our products as ingredients in their products. Countries into which our products are sold have regulations relating to the marketing, labeling and claims for dietary supplements. Since we do not presently sell products in form for use by consumers, our customers must comply with applicable government regulations. Our present and recent former customers are located in Taiwan or Hong Kong, which have laws concerning the ingredients in products sold for consumption, including the purity of the ingredients. If products which include our products as ingredients are sold in Hong Kong or any other country, the products may be subject to the food and supplement regulations of the country. We do not make any of the products we sell. To the extent a claim arises either as a result of the use by a consumer of products which contain our ingredients or a government agency raises questions about the purity of ingredients purchased from us, we may incur liability for any adverse reactions to the products purchased by consumers or failures of our products to conform to the stated purity of our products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to claim over against our supplier. If we sell products that are designed and packaged for use by consumers, we may be subject to laws relating to such products, including the purity and labeling of the products and any other regulations that may be applicable. 

If we sell products for consumer use in any country, we will be subject to the laws of that country. Each country has laws relating to products that are marketed as dietary supplements, including laws relating to the products and which describe the extent that products subject to the applicable laws, including the purity of the ingredients and marketing and labeling of products. We will need to comply with all applicable regulations and we may not be permitted to sell product in a country unless we have received prior approval from the applicable government agency. 

We sell our products to distributors and it is the responsibility of our customers to comply with applicable regulations in the countries in which they sell products, including Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.

To the extent that we either manufacture our product or have our product manufactured by a third party, we intend to use a third party for inspection, verification, testing and certification services.

Research and Development

We incurred research and development expenses of approximately $5.3 million in 2021, which reflects the amortization of equity compensation provided to our consultants whose services related to the development of our proposed chicken feed product,  We did not incur any research and development expenses in 2020.
Intellectual Property Rights

We do not have any patent or other intellectual property rights with respect to any products.

Competition

A number of companies market and sell cordyceps products in the United States, including Real Mushrooms, Bulk Supplements, Terrasoul SuperFoods; Mental Refreshment Nutrition, NOW Foods, Aloha Medicinals, Natures Elements and Swanson Premium. These products include cordyceps extract as well as products that include cordyceps along with other ingredients. Many, if not all, of these companies are better known and better capitalized than we are, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other existing suppliers of cordyceps. There are a few companies that offer cordyceps in chicken feed.  We believe that the market for this product is relatively small since cordyceps is extremely expensive and usually used for human consumption.

Employees

We have one employee, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who works for us on a part-time basis.
