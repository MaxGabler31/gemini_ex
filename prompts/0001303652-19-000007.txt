ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our mission is to help people see and understand data.
Our software products put the power of data into the hands of everyday people, allowing a broad population of business users to engage with their data, ask questions, solve problems and create value.
Based on innovative core technologies originally developed at Stanford University, our products dramatically reduce the complexity, inflexibility and expense associated with traditional business intelligence applications. 
Our software is designed for anyone with data and questions. We are democratizing the use of business analytics software by allowing people to access information, perform analysis and share results without assistance from technical specialists. By putting powerful, self-service analytical technology directly into the hands of people who make decisions with data, we seek to accelerate the pace of informed and intelligent decision-making. We believe this enables our customers to create better workplaces, with happier employees who are empowered to fully express their ingenuity and creativity.
Our products are used by people of diverse skill levels across all kinds of organizations, including Fortune 500 corporations, small and medium-sized businesses, government agencies, universities, research institutions and non-profits. Organizations employ our products in a broad range of use cases such as increasing sales, streamlining operations, improving customer service, managing investments, assessing quality and safety, studying and treating diseases, completing academic research, addressing environmental problems and improving education. In a world where data is virtually everywhere, we believe we are entering an era of analytics ubiquity. Our products are flexible and capable enough to help a single user on a laptop analyze data from a simple spreadsheet, or to enable tens of thousands of users across an enterprise to execute sophisticated queries against large and complex data sets.

Underpinning our innovative products is a set of technology advances that spans the domains of sophisticated computer graphics, human-computer interaction and high performance database systems. These technology innovations include VizQL and our Hybrid Data Architecture: 

• | VizQL—Our breakthrough visual query language, VizQL, translates drag-and-drop actions into data queries and then expresses that information visually. VizQL unifies the formerly disparate tasks of query and visualization and allows users to transform questions into pictures without the need for software scripts, chart wizards or dialogue boxes that inhibit speed and flexibility. This capability is designed to enable a more intuitive, creative and engaging experience for our users. VizQL can deliver dramatic gains in people's ability to see and understand data, and we believe it represents a foundational advancement in the field of analytics.


• | Hybrid Data Architecture—Our Hybrid Data Architecture combines the power and flexibility of our Live Query technology and Hyper, our in-memory data engine technology. Our Live Query technology allows users to instantaneously connect to large volumes of data in its existing format and location, including databases and cloud applications. This capability allows customers to leverage investments in their existing data platforms and to capitalize on the capabilities of high performance databases. Hyper, our in-memory data engine technology, is designed for fast data ingestion and analytical query processing on large or complex data sets. With enhanced extract creation and refresh performance, customers can choose to extract their data based on the needs of the business without concern for scheduling limitations or data volumes. Our Hybrid Data Architecture gives users the flexibility to access and analyze data from diverse sources and locations, while optimizing speed and performance for each source.

Our distribution strategy is designed to capitalize on the ease of use, low up-front cost, flexible deployment and collaborative capabilities of our software. To facilitate rapid adoption of our products, we provide fully-functional free trial versions of our products on our website and offer a flexible pricing model. After an initial trial or purchase, an organization has the flexibility to expand adoption of our products at any scale. During 2018, Tableau began offering role-based subscriptions via Tableau Creator, Explorer and Viewer subscriptions, each providing tailored combinations of our products' analytical capabilities that are designed for different user needs, from sophisticated analysts to casual users.
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 86,000 customer accounts across a broad array of company sizes and industries. Some of our largest customers include Charles Schwab, ExxonMobil, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Pfizer and various United States ("U.S.") Government Agencies. In addition, we have cultivated strong relationships with technology partners to help us extend the reach of our products. These partners include Alphabet Inc. ("Google"), Alteryx, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Cloudera, Inc., Informatica Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Snowflake Computing, Inc. and Teradata Corporation.
We adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard, codified as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. Our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard is described later in this report. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total ASC 606 revenues were $1.16 billion and total ASC 606 net loss was $77.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our total revenues under the previous standard, ASC 605, were $982.9 million, $877.1 million and $826.9 million, respectively. We incurred ASC 605 net losses of $277.2 million, $185.6 million and $144.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
We have generated positive cash flows from operating activities of $154.7 million, $226.9 million and $177.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Growth Strategy
Our mission to help people see and understand data presents a broad market opportunity. We intend to continue to invest in a number of growth initiatives to allow us to pursue our mission. Our strategies for growth include:

 5

new use cases for our products in the enterprise. Our sales and marketing strategy and our focus on customer success help our customers identify and pursue new use cases within their organizations. As this expansion occurs, we believe that our products will also increasingly supplant incumbent legacy platforms to become the standard platform for analytics and business intelligence for our customers.

• | Grow internationally—With approximately 31% of our total ASC 606 revenues generated from sales outside the United States and Canada in the year ended December 31, 2018, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our international business. Our products currently support eight languages, and we are expanding our direct sales force and indirect sales channels outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we had operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in these and other regions.


• | Relentlessly innovate and advance our products—We have sought to rapidly improve the capabilities of our products over time and intend to continue to invest in product innovation and leadership. Building on our foundational technology innovations, we continue to expand and improve our feature set and capabilities. For example, in February 2019, we released Tableau 2019.1 which introduced Ask Data, which leverages natural language processing to enable users to ask questions in plain language and get a visual response in Tableau. Also in February 2019, we released Tableau Prep Conductor, a new product that enables organizations to schedule and manage self-service data preparation at scale. Tableau Prep Conductor is part of a new subscription offering called the Tableau Data Management Add-On. Our plans to continue to invest in research and development include hiring top technical talent, focusing on core technology innovation, maintaining an agile organization that supports rapid release cycles and integrating acquired technologies. We intend to focus on further developing our cloud capabilities, offering faster data analysis, continuing to enhance our self-service platform and making data preparation easier.


• | Extend our distribution channels and partner ecosystem—We plan to continue investing in distribution channels, technology partners and other strategic relationships to help us enter and grow in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. We are actively growing our indirect distribution channels. Our most important technology partnerships include partnerships with Alteryx, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Cloudera, Inc., Google, Informatica Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Snowflake Computing, Inc. and Teradata Corporation, with which we have collaborated to develop high performance and optimized connectivity to a broad group of popular data stores and applications. We intend to continue to invest in partnerships that enable us to build and promote complementary capabilities that benefit our customers. We also offer application program interfaces ("APIs") to further empower the Tableau developer community and our original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") partner ecosystem to create applications that embed Tableau functionality.


• | Foster our passionate user community—We benefit from a vibrant and engaged user community. We are investing in initiatives to further expand and energize this group through our online community site, customer conferences and other events. Our seminal event is our annual global customer conference, Tableau Conference, which was most recently held in New Orleans and attended by more than 17,000 customers and partners in 2018. In 2018, we also hosted Tableau Conference Europe in London, which was attended by more than 1,800 customers and partners.


• | Treasure and cultivate our exceptional culture—We believe our culture is a core ingredient of our success. Our employees share a passion for our mission, and our mission stands at the top of a list of eight core cultural values that govern our approach to our business. Our other core values include: teamwork; product leadership; using our own products; respect; honesty; simplicity; and commitment to delighting customers. Our values permeate our organization and drive our identity as a company. For example, we strive to simplify all aspects of our business, including product user interfaces, pricing models, business processes and marketing strategies. Our culture is consistently cited in employee surveys as a key reason for their satisfaction with Tableau, and we have been publicly recognized as one of the best workplaces in a number of locations where we conduct our operations.

Products
Our products help people see and understand data. They offer the power and flexibility required to serve a broad range of use cases, from answering questions with small spreadsheets to complex enterprise business intelligence projects involving massive volumes of data. We currently offer five key products: Tableau Desktop, a self-service, powerful analytics product for anyone with data; Tableau Server, a business intelligence platform for organizations; Tableau Online, a hosted software-as-a-service ("SaaS") version of Tableau Server; Tableau Prep, 
 6

a data preparation product for combining, shaping and cleaning data; and Tableau Public, a free cloud-based platform for analyzing and sharing public data.
Tableau Desktop
Tableau Desktop helps knowledge workers make sense of the many kinds of data they encounter every day. The defining capability of Tableau Desktop is the interactive experience it provides for exploring and analyzing data. By fundamentally integrating data analysis and visualization, our products provide a visual window into data trapped in spreadsheets and databases, fostering greater engagement with data and allowing people to better answer questions, develop insights and solve problems. The result is a self-service analytics environment that empowers people to access and analyze data independently and at a rapid pace. Tableau Desktop's key capabilities include:

• | Visual analytics—Tableau Desktop empowers people to ask sophisticated questions by composing drag-and-drop pictures of their data. Tableau Desktop's easy-to-use interface is built on VizQL, which is capable of describing thousands of easily understood visual presentations of data including tables, maps, time series, dashboards and tables of graphs. The combination of a sophisticated language with a simple user interface means users can explore many different perspectives of their data. We believe being able to quickly view data from different perspectives inspires creative thinking and helps people find the right view to answer a question.


• | Analytical depth—An important aspect of Tableau Desktop is its ability to marry powerful visualization with deep analytics. Users can filter and sort their data, create sophisticated calculations, drill into underlying information, define sets and cohorts, perform statistical analysis and derive correlations between diverse data sets with agility and relative ease. For example, with a few clicks, users can generate sophisticated forecasting models. This combination of simplicity and usefulness, ease of use and analytical depth is what makes it possible for Tableau Desktop to empower a whole new group of people to become data analysts.


• | Data access—Tableau Desktop lets people access and query a large number of common data sources, from database systems such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Hadoop, Microsoft Azure Database, NoSQL, Snowflake and SQL Server, to Web applications like Google Analytics and Salesforce, to spreadsheets, PDFs and JSON files. Users can connect to more than 65 data connectors with a few clicks, without any scripting or programming.


• | Live query—Tableau Desktop translates users' interactions into live queries. As people use the drag-and-drop interface to examine information, they are automatically generating sophisticated queries against their database. Tableau Desktop can generate queries in a range of query languages including Structured Query Language ("SQL") and Multidimensional Expressions ("MDX"). Each query is optimized for the target platform and its unique performance and analytical characteristics. This live query approach allows customers to leverage their investments in database infrastructure and enables them to take advantage of query-optimized databases.


• | In-memory query—Tableau Desktop contains Hyper, an in-memory data engine technology that enables rapid analysis. A core Tableau platform technology, Hyper uses proprietary dynamic code generation and parallelism techniques to achieve fast performance for extract creation and query execution. By extracting data to Hyper, customers can analyze large or complex data sets faster.


• | Data integration—Many questions require combining data from multiple sources. Tableau Desktop provides a number of ways for people to combine data without requiring a typical data loading and transformation project. Users can connect to many different data sources, with each source independently leveraging either a live query or in-memory approach. Users can then combine the data in a single dashboard, visualization, filter or calculation using our data blending functionality. This approach can greatly extend the scope and depth of questions a person can answer.


• | Sharing and presentation—Tableau Desktop allows users to author and distribute visualizations and dashboards with the ease expected of everyday office tools like spreadsheets. Content created in Tableau Desktop can be embedded in documents and presentations, or the workbooks can be distributed for viewing by people who have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader, a free product to view and interact with visualizations built in Tableau Desktop. Alternately, users can publish their workbooks to Tableau Server or Tableau Online enabling others in the organization to access them using a Web browser or a mobile device.

Tableau Server
Tableau Server is a powerful business intelligence platform with enterprise-class security, governance and scalability. The collaborative features of Tableau Server are designed to foster more sharing of analytics to improve the dissemination of information across an organization and promote improved decision-making. Tableau Server's key capabilities include:

• | Shared content—Tableau Server provides an easy-to-navigate repository of shared visualizations and dashboards within an organization. Any user with appropriate credentials can view, interact, create data-driven alerts, edit and author new visualizations from published data using a Web browser. Users can also view and interact with published visualizations using a phone or tablet. The ability to publish dashboards and easily share impactful visual analysis increases awareness of business data and promotes improved decision-making. In addition, allowing others to interact with an analysis gives them deeper understanding of the information, which leads to an improved grasp on the problem and hence greater confidence in the solution.


• | Governed data—Organizations can use Tableau Server to centrally manage enterprise data sources and metadata enabling knowledge sharing, efficiency, governance and data consistency. Business users or IT professionals can create rich data models, containing calculations, hierarchies, field aliases, sets and security rules, and publish them to Tableau Server to be shared across an organization. Others can use these models as a starting point for analysis while extending them to meet their own specific analytical needs. While centralized data models are not a pre-requisite for analysis in Tableau, they provide flexibility and increased productivity while maintaining control and security of data.


• | Universal access—We have designed Tableau Server to enable seamless sharing of content across desktop, mobile and Web clients. Once users author and publish analytical content to the server, people across an organization can consume it on different browsers and devices. Further, Tableau Server automatically detects the device being used and adapts the content to take advantage of the device's capabilities including native touch experience and form factor. Tableau Server allows users to actively subscribe to content for automatic delivery on their devices or pull content on demand.


• | Integration and Embedded Analytics—Tableau Server offers APIs that help developers, customers and partners embed and control our software from portals, websites and other enterprise applications. Our APIs can also be used to generate in-memory Hyper extracts, upload content and add users to the server programmatically. In addition to APIs, we also offer command line utilities to automate management tasks, and data upload tools to move data rapidly into Tableau Server.


• | Scalability—Tableau Server's distributed multi-tier architecture allows it to scale to tens of thousands of users, across desktop, Web and mobile clients, meeting the needs of some of the largest organizations globally.


• | Security—Tableau Server provides a security model that encompasses authentication, authorization, data and network security. Tableau Server is also built on a multi-tenant architecture that allows administrators to logically partition a single system across user populations, providing for separation of content.


• | Administration—We believe the ease of administering a system is tremendously important to its adoption. While Tableau Server's management interface is designed to be simple enough for a line-of-business user, we also provide APIs to allow administrators to automate routine management processes.

Tableau Online
Tableau Online, a hosted SaaS version of Tableau Server, is built on the Tableau Server platform and provides ease of use, speed and availability without requiring customers to manage physical infrastructure. Tableau Online is a fully-hosted solution that can be accessed by clients remotely using Tableau Desktop, a browser or a mobile device. In addition to offering the same capabilities as Tableau Server, Tableau Online's key capabilities include:

• | Hybrid data connectivity—Tableau Online supports both live connectivity and in-memory extracts of cloud databases including Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery and Microsoft SQL Azure. Users can access real-time data from cloud data sources without requiring data snapshots.

• | On-premises data sync—Tableau Online provides easy syncing of on-premises data such as Microsoft Excel to the cloud through the Tableau Bridge feature. This enables customers to keep their data up-to-date.


• | Always up-to-date—Tableau Online includes the latest maintenance releases and versions of Tableau Server. Customers do not need to worry about upgrading their infrastructure or deploying the latest patches.


• | Reliable and scalable—Tableau Online is a SaaS analytics application built on the same enterprise-class architecture of Tableau Server.

Tableau Prep
Tableau Prep empowers users to get to analysis faster by helping them combine, shape and clean their data. Tableau Prep provides customers with features to make data preparation simple and integrates directly with the Tableau analytical workflow. Tableau Prep's key capabilities include: 

• | Complete Picture—Tableau Prep offers three coordinated views that provide users with a complete picture of their data and flow. Users have the flexibility to pick which view to interact with based on the task at hand.


• | Immediate results—Tableau Prep provides a direct and immediate experience allowing users to instantly see data change with each action, even on millions of rows of data. Immediate results give users the freedom to re-order steps and experiment without consequence.


• | Simplicity—Tableau Prep's drag and drop visual experience simplifies data preparation tasks such as joins, unions, pivots and aggregations.


• | Integration—Tableau Prep uses Tableau’s data connectors, calculation language and governance structure so users can get up to speed quickly and can collaborate at any point in the analytical process. Users can open a Tableau Prep workflow in Tableau Desktop at any time, or easily share it with Tableau Server or Tableau Online.


• | Smart Algorithms—Tableau Prep features smart algorithms to help automate common data preparation challenges. For example, Tableau Prep employs fuzzy clustering to turn repetitive tasks, like grouping by pronunciation or cleaning based on punctuation, into one-click operations.

Tableau Public
Tableau Public is a free cloud-based offering that is available for anyone to use with public data. This offering allows users of diverse backgrounds, including bloggers, journalists, researchers and government workers, to easily visualize and embed public data on their websites. People who visit these websites can interact with the visualizations and share them electronically via social media or other means.
Using Tableau Public, data can be transformed into interactive graphs, dashboards and maps for the world to see on the Web. For example, a blogger focused on economic issues may write a feature about changes in the U.S. unemployment rate. Using Tableau Public, the blogger can quickly build an interactive visualization using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and embed it in their blog. Every time the site is viewed, Tableau Public serves up the data as a dynamic visualization.
Tableau Public enables us to test new product features and engage in user research as well as generate greater awareness of Tableau and increase community engagement. In addition to offering most of the features of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server, Tableau Public offers the following capabilities:

• | Web scale—Tableau Public meets the massive performance requirements of serving dynamic content on top tier websites including media channels, social media and other consumer internet services. Through a combination of proprietary software and optimized hardware, we have designed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, online infrastructure. Tableau Public has reached over 1 billion cumulative views worldwide, and over 1 million visualizations have been published on Tableau Public to date.


• | Social reach—Anyone viewing or interacting with a Tableau Public visualization can share it on social media. The ease of social sharing has facilitated greater conversations around data on Tableau Public.


• | Embedding—Tableau Public views can be embedded in Web pages and blogs. Authors can enrich their websites and engage their audience with interactive visualizations based on Tableau Public.

Tableau Public has been used by hundreds of thousands of people to make public data easy to see and understand. People have used the product to visualize and share data about government budgets, school performance, economic policy, sports statistics and box office trends. Visualizations from Tableau Public have appeared in many news organizations' publications such as CNBC, Huffington Post, Business Insider, The Telegraph and Australia's ABC News, as well as publications from bloggers and researchers. 
Technology
Visual Query Language (VizQL) for Databases
At the heart of Tableau's products is our proprietary and breakthrough technology called VizQL. VizQL is a visual query language for data that simultaneously describes how to query data and how to present it visually. VizQL can deliver dramatic gains in people's ability to see and understand data. We believe VizQL is unique in several important aspects:

• | Extensibility and flexibility—VizQL is a computer language for describing pictures of data, including graphs, charts, maps, time series and tables of visualizations. VizQL unifies these different visual representations into a single framework. Conventional component architectures that underlie reporting packages and charting wizards contain a fixed number of computer procedures, one for each type of picture. VizQL, in contrast, is a language for creating pictures. Each type of picture is a different statement in the language. The extensibility and flexibility of VizQL makes it possible to create a virtually unlimited number of visualizations.


• | Transforms database records to graphical representations—VizQL statements define the mapping from records returned from a database to graphical marks on a screen. Some fields in the record control the geometric properties of the mark, including position, size and orientation while other fields control visual attributes like color, transparency and shape.


• | Declarative language—VizQL is a declarative language like other database languages, including SQL. The advantage of a declarative language is that the user describes what picture should be created, not how to make it. The user does not need to be aware of underlying implementation as query, analysis and rendering operations run behind the scenes. The result is a portable and more scalable system.


• | Defines and controls queries—VizQL procedures define both the resulting picture and the database query. Our Live Query Engine generates efficient queries for external databases of many types from many vendors. VizQL also controls execution of our optimized in-memory data engine technology to perform calculations in real time.


• | Optimized—VizQL's interpreter is optimized for interactive use, enabling visualization and drawing of large data sets. VizQL is specifically designed to take advantage of modern computer graphics hardware, such as the fast rendering chips developed for gaming that are standard on personal computers.

The initial development of VizQL began at Stanford University in 1999. Stanford University has granted us an exclusive license to commercialize the software and related patents resulting from that research. The software and related patents generally relate to three subject areas: (1) architecture for creating table-based visualizations from relational databases; (2) graphical user interface for creating specification for table-based visualizations; and (3) an environment for rapid development of interactive visualizations. Our license from Stanford University is exclusive in all fields, worldwide and sublicensable. The license agreement provides for Tableau to own all improvements to and derivative works of the software that it develops. The license agreement also provides for enforcement of the licensed patents against alleged infringers. If Stanford University and Tableau agree to jointly enforce the licensed patents against an alleged infringer, the parties equally share the costs and the recovery or settlement for such enforcement. If Stanford University and Tableau do not agree to jointly enforce the licensed patents against an alleged infringer, Stanford University and Tableau will each have the right to enforce the licensed patents against the alleged infringer. If Tableau files such a suit in a United States court, Stanford University joins such suit only for standing purposes, and Tableau wins an award of damages for, or receives a settlement payment for, infringement of a United States licensed patent, Tableau would retain that award or settlement payment and would be required to negotiate in good faith with Stanford University to compensate it for its expenses in connection with the suit. If Stanford University files such a suit in a United States court, Tableau joins such suit only for standing purposes, and Stanford University wins an award of damages for, or receives a settlement payment for, infringement of a United States licensed patent, Stanford University would retain that award or settlement payment. The license agreement does not expire and can be terminated by Stanford University only if Tableau breaches the agreement and does not remedy the breach within 30 days after receiving 
 10

written notice of the alleged breach from Stanford University. We have invested substantial research and development in VizQL since obtaining these rights. We have also been granted additional patents related to our core VizQL technology.
Live Query Engine
We have developed a Live Query Engine that interprets abstract queries generated by VizQL into syntax understandable by popular database systems. For instance, our Live Query Engine can compile VizQL statements into optimized SQL and MDX syntax understandable by database systems made by Amazon.com, Inc., Google, Microsoft Corporation, SAP SE, Snowflake Computing, Inc., Teradata Corporation and many other database vendors. As a result, our technology provides customers with a way to increase the accessibility, usability and performance of their databases. It also gives them a uniform user interface for interacting with databases of diverse vendors, formats and sizes.
It is common for traditional business intelligence products to import data from the organization's database systems. In contrast, Tableau's Live Query Engine enables people to query databases without having to first import the data into our products. Queries generated by our Live Query Engine are interpreted and run by the database, with only the results of each query rendered. This approach offers many advantages for customers:

• | Data consistency—Copying data can cause people to work with out-of-date information. Further, each copy of the data may represent information at different times leading to inconsistency. With our Live Query Engine, customers do not need to create additional copies of their data.


• | Avoids data movement—Moving and loading data is often time consuming and expensive. With Live Query Engine, our customers do not need to move data in order to use our products.


• | Scalability—Many database vendors provide massively parallel implementations of databases that provide scalable data access to large data sets. These systems can scale in various ways including scaling the number of tables in the database, the number of records in each table, the number of columns in each record, the number of users and the number of active queries. These systems also provide powerful computation capabilities for very large data volumes. Our Live Query Engine allows businesses to leverage their investment in scalable data infrastructure.


• | Security—Transferring data out of a database causes customers to lose the security and permissions models associated with that data. Using our Live Query Engine, customers can leverage the security and permissions models specified in their database systems.


• | Flexibility—The database industry consists of multiple vendors with competitively differentiated products. Our Live Query Engine enables our customers to choose the appropriate technology for their business.

We focus on ensuring our software is compatible with popular database platforms and that our live query technology works with the most recent releases of those platforms. Our Live Query Engine is compatible with more than 65 data connectors.
We believe the size of the data that our customers analyze continues to grow. We will continue to develop our live query technology with the goal of empowering our users to have complete access to any data stored anywhere.
Hyper
Hyper is a high-performance in-memory data engine technology that helps customers analyze large or complex data sets by efficiently evaluating analytical queries directly in the transactional database. A core Tableau platform technology, Hyper uses proprietary dynamic code generation and cutting-edge parallelism techniques to achieve fast performance for extract creation and query execution. Hyper provides users with the following benefits:

• | Column-based storage—Transactions and analytical queries are processed on the same column store, with no post-processing needed after data ingestion. This reduces stale data and minimizes the connection gap between specialized systems. Hyper's unique approach allows a true combination of read-and write-heavy workloads in a single system, providing fast extract creation without sacrificing fast query performance.


• | Dynamic code generation—Hyper uses a just-in-time compilation execution model. Hyper optimizes and compiles queries into custom machine code to make better use of the underlying hardware. The end result is better utilization of modern hardware for faster query execution.

 11


• | Morsel-driven parallelization—Hyper includes a parallelization model that is based on very small units of work ("morsels"). These morsels are assigned efficiently across all available cores, allowing Hyper to more efficiently account for differences in core speed. This translates into more efficient hardware utilization and faster performance.

By importing data into Hyper, our customers can get many of the benefits of a fast database without the complication, cost and delay of a new investment in databases systems. Hyper is designed to be used on commodity hardware common in enterprise organizations today.
Hybrid Data Architecture
We have designed our Live Query technology and in-memory data engine technology to work in harmony. This hybrid approach gives customers flexibility and power. For instance, customers can use our in-memory data engine to import a sample of data from a large database, and then after designing an initial visualization that answers a question, run the visualization against the entire database using the live query option. As another example of the hybrid approach, customers can integrate live data with in-memory data in a single visualization or dashboard. Both of these examples can be achieved by business users without any programming or scripting.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services. Our quarterly sales are impacted by industry buying patterns. As a result, our sales have generally been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and lowest in the first quarter.
Customers
Our software is designed for anyone with data and questions. Our customers range from the largest corporations in the world to sole proprietors. Tableau's ease of installation and maintenance provides the flexibility to be deployed by individuals, departments or as an enterprise-wide platform. We provide our products to organizations in various industries, including business services, energy and telecommunications, financial services, life sciences and healthcare, manufacturing and technology, media and entertainment, public sector and education, and retail, consumer and distribution.
We continue to expand our customer base. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 86,000 customer accounts compared to over 70,000 as of December 31, 2017 and over 54,000 as of December 31, 2016. We define a customer account as a single purchaser of our products. Customer accounts are typically organizations. In some cases, organizations will have multiple groups purchasing our software, which we count as discrete customer accounts. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Mix and Timing of Sales
Our business model results in a wide variety of sales transaction sizes. The time it takes to close a transaction, defined as the time between the entering of a sales opportunity into our customer relationship management system and the signing of a related license agreement with the customer, generally varies based on the size of the transaction. Our enterprise license agreements generally have more extended sales cycles and take longer to close. 
Our sales mix is also impacted by our continued transition to a more subscription-based business model. In April 2018, we introduced role-based subscription offerings to help organizations scale analytics. 
Role-Based Subscription Offerings
Tableau Creator, Explorer and Viewer subscriptions each provide tailored combinations of Tableau's analytical capabilities designed for different user needs, from sophisticated analysts to casual users. Further details on each role-based subscription offering follow:

Training
In order to enable our customers to be self-reliant, we offer free online training to customers on our website, including hundreds of hours of training videos, sample visualizations and best practice articles.
We also provide a variety of fee-based product training options ranging from instructor-led courses in a traditional classroom setting to online courses. These training courses are designed to deepen understanding of specific aspects of our products and range from a single day to a week in length.
Professional Services
We have also invested in a professional services organization to help our customers maximize their benefits from using our products. Our professional services are generally intended to accelerate the analytics process rather than focus on installation and configuration of our software, as we believe most of our customers are able to deploy our products without assistance. These services are delivered either in person or remotely, and we tailor our services engagements to a customer's specific needs.
Tableau Community 
We have built a strong and growing community of users and partners that help us achieve our mission. The purpose of our community is to give customers and prospects opportunities to connect and share their experiences and ideas, and to allow them to provide valuable feedback on our products that helps us prioritize product enhancements.
Our online community currently offers:

• | knowledge bases, forums and repositories that help users learn about topics of interest, ask questions and share insights;


• | Tableau user groups, which allow users to connect based on geographical location or industry affiliation;


• | Ideas Forum, an avenue to share product suggestions;


• | Viz Talk, designed to let users share and discuss interesting data visualizations;


• | how-to blogs; and


• | other news.

We also organize events to engage with our customers and foster our user community. Our seminal event is our annual global customer conference, Tableau Conference, which was most recently held in New Orleans and 
 13

attended by more than 17,000 customers and partners in 2018. In 2018, we also hosted Tableau Conference Europe in London, which was attended by more than 1,800 customers and partners. At these events, our customers have the opportunity to network and connect, learn best practices, attend training sessions and present their questions and suggestions directly to our software developers, executives and other employees. Many of our customers also form local user groups that meet periodically to discuss and share experiences using our products.
Culture and Employees
Our culture is fundamental to our success and we embrace and cultivate it with pride. We view our employees as partners in creating a great work environment, and we take a long-term approach to their recruitment, development and retention. As a result of our careful hiring choices, we believe our company is populated by smart, respectful people grounded in humility.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 4,181 full-time employees globally. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams collaborate to create market awareness and demand, to build a robust sales pipeline and to ensure customer success that drives revenue growth.
Sales
Our sales efforts are built on a business model that is designed to capitalize on the ease of use, low up-front cost, flexible deployment and collaborative capabilities of our software. To facilitate rapid adoption of our products, we provide fully-functional free trial versions of our products on our website and offer a flexible pricing model. After an initial trial or purchase, which is often made to target a specific business need at a grassroots level within an organization, the use of our products often spreads across departments, divisions and geographies, via word-of-mouth, discovery of new use cases and our sales efforts.
Our direct sales approach includes inside sales and field sales teams. Our inside sales team, based in regional sales hubs, qualifies and manages accounts throughout the world to seed new sales at a low cost and expand these accounts over time. Our direct field sales team covers North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; the Asia Pacific region; and Latin America, and is mainly responsible for lead qualification and account management for large enterprises. All our direct sales teams partner with technical sales representatives who provide presales technical support. We also have a dedicated customer renewals team responsible for driving renewals of existing contracts.
We also sell our products through indirect sales channels including technology vendors, resellers, OEMs, independent software vendors ("ISV") and distributors. These channel partners provide additional sales coverage and deliver solution-based selling, services and training throughout the world. Our channel program is led by a dedicated sales team that provides our channel partners with training, certification and sales resources. As of December 31, 2018, less than 10% of our sales team focused on indirect sales channels. We plan to continue to invest in our partner programs to help us enter and grow in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. 
Our sales organization also includes professional services and training teams that work with customers of all sizes to support implementations and increase adoption. These efforts include in person and phone-based engagements, webinars, in-person training and free on-demand training.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts focus on establishing and enhancing our brand, generating awareness of our products, creating leads and cultivating the Tableau community. The marketing team consists primarily of marketing operations, demand generation, enterprise marketing, product marketing, programs, field events, channel marketing, corporate communications and visual design teams. We leverage both online and offline marketing channels such as events and trade shows, seminars and webinars, third-party analyst reports, whitepapers, case studies, blogs, search engines, email and social media marketing. A central focus for the marketing team is to drive free product trials and encourage use of our free online training, an integral part of our customer acquisition process. Our marketing team is responsible for the logistics of hosting various events, including our annual customer conferences and regional events, as well as providing Web-based community tools and supporting customer-driven user groups.
 14

We believe the simplest way to showcase our products is by using them in live or recorded demonstrations. Our marketing team also promotes Tableau Public to generate awareness. By democratizing access to public data and facilitating sharing of insights online, Tableau Public has rapidly increased community engagement and extended the reach of our products. Tableau Public has reached over 1 billion cumulative views worldwide, and over 1 million visualizations have been published on Tableau Public to date.
Strategic Relationships
We view our partners as an extension of our team, playing an integral role in our growth. Our partner programs include technology partnerships, reseller arrangements, OEMs, ISVs and distributors. In addition, we also work closely with system integrators, consulting firms and training partners.
Technology Vendors
Our most important technology partnerships are with data platform vendors. We collaborate with these vendors to build high performance connectivity to their data sources. We have cultivated strong relationships with technology partners to help us extend the reach of our products. These partners include Alteryx, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Cloudera, Inc., Google, Informatica Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Snowflake Computing, Inc. and Teradata Corporation.
Resellers/VARs
Most of our indirect sales are through resellers. In certain international markets, we rely more heavily on resellers than we do in the United States. Our reseller program is designed to support business growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience and care, increase profitability and close deals more quickly. We partner with value-added resellers ("VARs"), who provide vertical expertise and technical advice in addition to reselling or bundling our software. We qualify our partners carefully to help ensure that each has the necessary capabilities and technical expertise to allow us to deliver even greater value to our customers.
OEMs
We believe that software applications made by other companies can benefit from the analytical capabilities that our products can provide, and we continue to develop relationships with OEM partners that embed our software into their applications. These consist of both traditional OEMs that provide a customized version of our products for their applications as well as SaaS-based OEMs that deliver analytics as a service.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and to bring new products and product enhancements to market. Our research and development organization, primarily located in the U.S., is predominantly responsible for design, development, testing and certification of our products and core technologies. Our mission-driven culture empowers our employees to take ownership and personal pride in building our products. We work hard to create an environment that satisfies our talents and intellectual curiosities while promoting the development of broadly impactful and transformative technologies.
We currently target product releases on a quarterly cycle. We also provide maintenance releases with bug fixes and incremental functionality if and when they become available. Our release cycles enable us to be responsive to customers by delivering new functionality on a frequent basis. We establish priorities for our organization by collaborating closely with our customers, community and employees. We use our products across all business functions at Tableau, from customer support to finance to sales and marketing to human resources, and every employee is encouraged to test and provide feedback.
Our founders conducted the original research that led to the development of VizQL at Stanford University. We actively invest in an internally focused research effort and collaborate with the research and academic community to keep current with cutting edge technologies and help us to stay at the forefront of innovation.
We are focused on hiring the top technical talent in the industry from top engineering programs and research institutions. Our talented engineers and computer scientists are focused on finding simple and elegant solutions to complex problems in information visualization, data analytics, user experience and distributed system design.

Competition
Our current primary competitors generally fall into the following categories:

• | large technology companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, and/or cloud-based offerings that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our products, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Google, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, salesforce.com, inc. and SAP SE;


• | business analytics software companies, such as MicroStrategy, Qlik and TIBCO Spotfire (a subsidiary of TIBCO Software Inc.); and


• | providers of SaaS-based or cloud-based analytics products.

In addition, we may compete with open source initiatives and custom development efforts. We operate in a rapidly growing and rapidly changing market. As a result, we expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the business analytics market, as customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our SaaS-based offering. This is a relatively new and evolving area of business analytics solutions, and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for these types of products.
Many of our competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business analytics industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, for example by offering a SaaS-based product that competes with our on-premises products or our SaaS product, Tableau Online, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us. Moreover, many of these competitors are bundling their analytics products into larger deals or maintenance renewals, often at significant discounts. Increased competition may lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.
Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include ease and speed of product deployment and use, discovery and visualization capabilities, analytical and statistical capabilities, performance and scalability, the quality and reliability of our customer service and support, total cost of ownership, return on investment and brand recognition. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our products, as well as adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Moreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential customers. In addition, our current or prospective indirect sales channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors. These relationships may limit our ability to sell or certify our products through specific distributors, technology providers, database companies and distribution channels and allow our competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from existing and new customers and to maintain maintenance services revenues from our existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the 
 16

registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 40 issued U.S. patents covering our technology and 95 patent applications pending for examination in the United States. Internationally, we had two issued patents in Australia and 15 pending patent applications as of December 31, 2018 including filings at the European Patent Office and in Canada and Australia. We own registered trademarks for Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, Tableau Doctor, VizQL, Show Me! and Data In. Brilliance Out. in the United States. We also own trademark registrations for Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, VizQL and Show Me! in Canada and China; Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, Tableau Doctor, VizQL and Show Me! in Japan and the European Union; Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo, Tableau Doctor and VizQL in Australia; Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Logo, the Tableau Software Logo and VizQL in Korea and Mexico; Tableau, the Tableau Logo, VizQL and Show Me! in Norway; Tableau, TABLEAUSOFTWARE, the Tableau Software Logo and VIZQL in Brazil; Tableau, the Tableau Logo and VizQL in Chile; Tableau, the Tableau Logo and VizQL in Hong Kong; Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Software Logo and VizQL in India; Tableau, the Tableau Logo, Show Me! and VizQL in Israel; Tableau, Tableau Doctor, Show Me! and VizQL in Singapore; Tableau, Tableau Software, the Tableau Software Logo, the Tableau Logo and VizQL in South Africa; Show Me!, Tableau Doctor and VizQL in the United Kingdom; and Tableau, the Tableau Logo, VizQL and ShowMe! in Switzerland. Such registered trademarks will expire unless renewed at various times in the future.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
