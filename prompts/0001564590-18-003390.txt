Overview 
 Atara Biotherapeutics is a leading T-cell immunotherapy company developing novel treatments for patients with cancer, autoimmune and viral diseases. The Company's off-the-shelf, or allogeneic, T-cells are bioengineered from donors with healthy immune function and allow for rapid delivery from inventory to patients without a requirement for pretreatment. Atara's T-cell immunotherapies are designed to precisely recognize and eliminate cancerous or diseased cells without affecting normal, healthy cells. Atara's most advanced T-cell immunotherapy in development, tabelecleucel (formerly known as ATA129), is being developed for the treatment of patients with Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, or EBV+ PTLD, who have failed rituximab, as well as other EBV associated hematologic and solid tumors, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or NPC. Off-the-shelf ATA188 and autologous, or patient derived, ATA190, the Company's T-cell immunotherapies using a complementary targeted antigen recognition technology, target specific EBV antigens believed to be important for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS. Atara's clinical pipeline also includes ATA520 targeting Wilms Tumor 1, or WT1, and ATA230 directed against cytomegalovirus, or CMV.
 Our technology allows for rapid delivery of a T-cell immunotherapy product that has been manufactured in advance and stored in inventory, with each manufactured lot of cells providing therapy for numerous potential patients. This differs from autologous, or patient-derived, treatments, in which each patient’s own cells must be extracted, modified outside the body and then delivered back to the patient. We utilize a proprietary cell selection algorithm to select the appropriate set of cells for use based on a patient’s unique immune profile, and, unlike many other T-cell programs, there is neither a requirement for pre-treatment before our cells are administered nor is there extended monitoring following administration. For example, in our ongoing trials with our most advanced product candidate, tabelecleucel, patients are monitored for one to two hours following receipt of tabelecleucel. Our T-cell immunotherapy platform is applicable to a broad array of targets and diseases. With more than 200 patients treated across the platform, we have observed clinical proof of concept across both viral and non-viral targets in conditions ranging from liquid and solid tumors to infectious and autoimmune diseases. We have also observed a safety profile characterized by few treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, and no evidence of cytokine release syndrome to date.
 Our T-cell immunotherapy product candidates are engineered from cells donated by healthy individuals with normal immune function. Once cells are collected from a donor, they are bioengineered to expand those T-cells that recognize the antigens of interest. The resulting expanded T-cells are then characterized and held as inventory. From inventory, these cells can be selected, distributed and prepared for infusion in a partially human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, matched patient in approximately 3-5 days. Following administration, our T-cells home to their target, undergo target-controlled proliferation, eliminate diseased cells and eventually recede. Target-controlled proliferation means that our T-cells expand in number when they encounter diseased cells in a patient’s body that express the antigen the cells are designed to recognize.
 We have two technology platforms. One of our technology platforms was developed from more than a decade of experience at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK. The other was developed at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, or QIMR Berghofer, in Australia. We licensed rights to certain know-how and T-cell product candidates from MSK in June 2015. Our most advanced product candidate, tabelecleucel, targets EBV. Tabelecleucel received Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is currently being evaluated as monotherapy in two Phase 3 trials for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD. We believe that tabelecleucel has the potential to be the first commercially available off-the-shelf T-cell immunotherapy and the first FDA and EMA approved therapy for EBV+ PTLD. With a European conditional marketing authorization application planned for the first half of 2019 and U.S. biologics licensing applications planned following the completion of one of our ongoing Phase 3 trials, we are currently developing the infrastructure to commercialize tabelecleucel globally in EBV+ PTLD. We are also evaluating the potential utility of tabelecleucel in patients with other EBV associated cancers, such as NPC, to continue its development in solid tumors. Additional product candidates derived from the collaboration with MSK are being developed to treat various cancers and severe viral infections.
 In October 2015 and September 2016, we licensed rights to certain know-how and technology from QIMR Berghofer that are complementary to those we which was licensed from MSK. This know-how and technology uses targeted antigen recognition to create off-the-shelf T-cell immunotherapy product candidates applicable to a variety of diseases, including autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, or MS. We are also working with QIMR Berghofer on the development of EBV and other virally targeted T-cells. Through this technology, we are expanding the role of immunotherapy beyond oncology and viral infections to autoimmune disease. Our most advanced off-the-shelf T-cell product candidate utilizing this technology, ATA188, targets select antigens of EBV and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in an initial cohort for the treatment of patients with progressive MS. In connection with the initial license from QIMR Berghofer, we received an option to exclusively license an autologous version of ATA188, also known as ATA190, which recently demonstrated clinical activity in a Phase 1 trial in progressive MS. We expect to broadly explore the utility of our targeted antigen recognition technology in EBV and other virally driven diseases, and additional product candidates derived from our collaboration with QIMR Berghofer are being developed.

Overall, we believe that Atara is a leading allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy company with a robust and late stage oncology pipeline and potentially transformative T-cell immunotherapies for MS and other viral diseases. With tabelecleucel poised to potentially become the first approved off-the-shelf T-cell therapy and a robust pipeline of high potential candidates, our ambition is to be recognized as the leader in off-the-shelf T-cell immunotherapy.
 Tabelecleucel for EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT
 Since its discovery as the first human oncovirus, EBV has been implicated in the development of a wide range of diseases, including lymphomas and other cancers. EBV is widespread in human populations and persists as a lifelong, asymptomatic infection. In healthy individuals, a small percentage of T-cells are devoted to keeping E
BV in check. In contrast, immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplants, or 
HCT, 
or solid organ transplants, or SOT, have a reduced ability to control EBV. Left without appropriate immune surveillance, EBV transformed cells can, in some patients, proliferate and cause an aggressive, life-threatening cancer called EBV+ PTLD. Nearly all cases of PTLD that occur following HCT are EBV positive while approximately 70% of PTLD cases that occur following SOT are EBV positive. Approximately 10-15% of PTLD patients are children. Patients with EBV+ PTLD are currently treated with rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy when systemic treatment is indicated, with approximately 50-60% of patients either not responding to or progressing following this first line of therapy. Historical studies suggest a high unmet medical need for improved therapies in patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab. Median overall survival in patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rit
uximab-based first line therapy is 16-56 days, with a one-year survival rate of approximately 23% based on our evaluation of available historical outcomes data. One- and two-year survival following incomplete response to rituximab in patients with high-risk EBV+ PTLD after SOT is 36% and 0%, respectively. The use of chemotherapy in patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab is frequently associated with significant rates of treatment-related mortality due to the frailty of the patients and severe toxicities associated with chemotherapy.
 We believe that the global commercial opportunity for PTLD is attractive. We expect the number of EBV+ PTLD patients to grow over time as a result of increases in the number of transplant procedures and an increasing r
ate of PTLD following these procedures. Based on our 
market research, we estimate that in 2019, approximately 164,000 HCT and SOT transplant procedures are expected to be performed in the United States, the European Union, or EU, Australia, Canada, China, 
Japan, South Korea and Turkey, with this number expected to increase to approximately 207,000 by 2024, 
predominantly due to increases in bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood donation and more haploidentical transplants. Similarly, the number of cases of EBV+ PTLD is expected to increase from approximately 4,700 in 2019 to 6,000 in 2024 due to the use of more potent immuno-suppression in haploidentical transplants.
 Our most advanced T-cell immunotherapy product candidate, tabelecleucel, is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy that is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab. In February 2015, the FDA granted tabelecleucel BTD in the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT who have failed rituximab. BTD is an FDA process designed to accelerate the development and review of drugs intended to treat a serious condition when early trials show that the drug may be substantially better than current treatment. In October
 2016, tabelecleucel was accepted into the EMA PRIME regulatory pathway for the same indication, providing enhanced regulatory support. In addition, tabelecleucel has received orphan status in the United States and European Union for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT. In December 2016, we announced that we had reached agreement with the FDA on the designs of two Phase 3 trials for tabelecleucel intended to support approval in two separate indications, the treatment of EBV+ PTLD following HCT and SOT in patients who have failed rituximab. In December 2017, following discussion with the FDA of manufacturing and comparability data generated on material manufactured by our contract manufacturing organization, we initiated these trials in the United States. We expect to expand these trials geographically to include Europe, Canada, and Australia.
 The Phase 3 MATCH trial (EBV+ PTLD following HCT) is a multicenter, open label, single arm trial designed to enroll approximately 35 patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab. The Phase 3 ALLELE trial (EBV+ PTLD following SOT) is a multicenter, open label trial with two non-comparative cohorts. Each cohort is designed to enroll approximately 35 patients. The first cohort will include patients who previously received rituximab monotherapy, and the second cohort will include patients who previously received rituximab plus chemotherapy. Both cohorts are planned to enroll concurrently. The primary endpoint of both the MATCH and ALLELE trials is confirmed best objective response rate, or ORR, defined as the percent of patients achieving either a complete or partial response to treatment with tabelecleucel confirmed after the initial tumor assessment showing a response. The protocols are designed to rule out a 20% ORR as the null hypothesis. This means that if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval on ORR among patients receiving at least one dose of tabelecleucel exceeds 20% at the end of the study, then the trial would be expected to meet the primary endpoint for the treatment of PTLD. For example, assuming anticipated enrollment of 35 patients in MATCH, an observed ORR above approximately 37% would be expected to meet the primary endpoint. In ALLELE, each of the two cohorts with an anticipated enrollment of 35 patients will be analyzed separately with respect to the primary endpoint and, similarly, as an example, with 35 patients enrolled in either cohort, an observed ORR above approximately 37% would be expected to meet the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints for both trials include duration of response, overall survival, safety, quality of life metrics, and other measures to evaluate its health economic impact. A safety committee will meet periodically to monitor for safety. Results from the first tabelecleucel Phase 3 study, or cohort in the case of ALLELE, to reach the primary endpoint are expected to be available in the first half of 2019.

In clinical trials conducted at MSK that have enrolled patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and SOT, efficacy following treatment with tabelecleucel monotherapy compared favorably with historical data in these patient populations. Patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT who have failed rituximab and were treated with tabelecleucel had one-year overall survival of approximately 70% in two separate clinical trials. In the setting of EBV+ PTLD after SOT in patients who have failed rituximab, similar results were observed, with one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in tabelecleucel-treated patients. A response rate of greater than or equal to 50% was observed in HCT and SOT patients in these studies. In June 2016, we opened a multicenter expanded access protocol, or EAP, trial. The trial is currently open at more than ten clinical sites in the United States. The primary objective of this trial is to provide tabelecleucel monotherapy to patients with EBV-associated diseases or certain EBV positive malignancies for whom there are no other therapeutic options. Key secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy and safety through a robust collection of data. We recently announced the presentation of positive interim results from this multicenter EAP trial at the 59th American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting. Efficacy results in 11 patients from the planned Phase 3 populations with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and SOT who had failed rituximab were consistent with the single-institution safety profile and response rates previously reported by our collaborating investigators at MSK. The response rates in both the five evaluable HCT patients treated in the EAP and the six evaluable SOT patients was greater than 70%. An additional patient with EBV+ PTLD following HCT remains alive but was not evaluable due to lack of post-baseline assessment. We believe these results are consistent with the tabelecleucel profile observed in the Phase 2 trials conducted at MSK. The Phase 3 trials for tabelecleucel are expected to enroll the same EBV+ PTLD patient populations. Tabelecleucel was generally well tolerated in this study population. In this study, five patients experienced treatment-related SAEs. One patient died due to PTLD disease progression. Two possibly related cases of graft versus host disease, or GvHD, in patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT were reported. A tumor flare was observed in one patient with EBV+HIV-associated plasmablastic lymphoma that resolved without clinical sequelae.
 With respect to the total safety population following treatment with tabelecleucel, few treatment-related SAEs have been observed. Among 173 patients treated with tabelecleucel in clinical trials, there have been 12 patients with possibly related SAEs, with no infusion related toxicities, no cytokine release syndrome and three possibly related cases of GvHD.
 We are also pursuing marketing approval of tabelecleucel in the European Union. In March 2016, the EMA issued a positive opinion for orphan drug designation for tabelecleucel for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD. In October 2016, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and the Committee for Advanced Therapi
es granted tabelecleucel access to the EMA’s recently established PRIME regulatory initiative for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab. PRIME provides early enhanced regulatory support to facilitate regulatory applications and accelerate the review of medicines that address a high unmet need. In January 2017, we received parallel scientific advice from the EMA’s Scientific Advice Working Group and several national Health Technology Assessment agencies in the EU, including those in the United Kingdom, Germany and France. Based on these discussions, we plan to submit an application for Conditional Marketing Authorization, or CMA, of tabelecleucel in the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab in the first half of 2019. The CMA will be based on clinical data from Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted at MSK and supported by available data from our Phase 3 MATCH and ALLELE trials in patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT and SOT who have failed rituximab, which will be ongoing at the time of filing.
 In 2017, we began pre-commercial preparation to support the planned tabelecleucel EU CMA submission. For example, we are developing a proprietary, web-based, off-the-shelf delivery solution for commercial use that we call Atara MatchMe™. The Atara MatchMe system will be a portal for health care professionals and institutions that allows for order input including the provision of required patient HLA and other information, the execution of our cell selection algorithm, product shipment and tracking, as well as the capture of data on outcomes following treatment. In the first quarter of 2017, we also signed a lease for an approximately 90,580 square foot facility in Thousand Oaks, California. We are building out a multi-product cellular therapy manufacturing facility with operations expected to commence in 2018. Overall, we believe that tabelecleucel monotherapy has a compelling value proposition in the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab. We expect to pursue approvals globally for tabelecleucel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and SOT who have failed rituximab and may seek partners to aid in our commercialization efforts in select markets. In addition, we expect to pursue development of tabelecleucel in earlier lines of therapy, including first line EBV+ PTLD in combination with rituximab.
 Tabelecleucel for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or NPC
 NPC, is a type of head and neck cancer that is primarily EBV associated. Standard treatment for NPC includes radiation therapy with or without platinum-based chemotherapy. In the setting of metastatic disease after the failure of chemotherapy, median survival is approximately five to 11 months based on historical data, and there are no approved therapeutic agents available to treat this disease today. Based on our market research, we estimate that in 2015 there were approximately 9,400 patients with metastatic or recurrent Type III NPC in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and approximately 93,000 in Asia. Treatment with tabelecleucel as a monotherapy has been evaluated in 14 patients with metastatic NPC after failure of one to three lines of chemotherapy in the studies conducted by MSKCC. An ORR of 21% was observed in these patients with one complete response and two partial responses. In addition, 11 of the 14 patients were alive at a median follow up of 18 months with a Kaplan-
 6


Meier survival estimate of 84% at two years. Tabelecleucel was administered to this immune competent patient population without prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Additionally, evidence of T-cell expansion following administration was observed. In April 2017, we entered into an agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) to provide drug supply for a trial sponsored and conducted by us to evaluate tabelecleucel in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), in patients with platinum-resistant or recurrent EBV-associated NPC. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination and is planned for initiation in the second half of 2018.
Other T-Cell Programs
 ATA188 and ATA190 for multiple sclerosis
 MS is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system, or CNS, that disrupts the myelination and normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. The evolution of MS results in an increasing loss of both physical and cognitive (e.g., memory) function. This has a substantial negative impact on the approximately 2.3 million people worldwide affected by MS.
 There are two categories of MS: progressive MS, or PMS; and relapsing-remitting MS, or RRMS. PMS is a severe form of MS with few therapeutic options. Within PMS there are two types of MS: secondary progressive MS, or SPMS; and primary progressive MS, or PPMS. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, there are approximately one million people affected by PMS. Both types of PMS are characterized by persistent progression and worsening of MS symptoms and physical disability over time. PPMS occurs when the patient has a disease course characterized by steady and progressive worsening after disease onset. SPMS initially begins as RRMS, but once patients have continuous progression of their disease, they have developed SPMS. This is distinct from RRMS, where patients have flares of the disease that are followed by periods of recovery and quiescence during which the disease does not progress. There is substantial unmet medical need for new and effective therapies for patients with PMS. Most of the treatment options that work well in reducing the flares in RRMS have not been shown to be effective in slowing or reversing the progression of disability in PMS. The two approved therapeutic options for PMS patients have a modest impact on symptoms and disease progression and, therefore, we believe that unmet need remains. In the United States, mitoxantrone is approved for SPMS and ocrelizumab was approved in March 2017 for PPMS. Siponimod is currently being studied in Phase 3 trials for SPMS.
 There is a strong biologic connection between EBV and MS. EBV is present in nearly all patients with MS. For example, in an international study of patients with clinically isolated syndrome, a CNS demyelinating event isolated in time that is compatible with the possible future development of MS, only one patient out of 1,407 was seronegative for, or not infected with, EBV. In addition, in separate studies, clusters of EBV infected B-cells and plasma cells were evident in the brains of MS patients but not found in brains of patients without MS. In these studies, the EBV infected B-cells and plasma cells were in close proximity to areas of active demyelination. Studies suggest that EBV positive B-cells and plasma cells in the CNS have the potential to catalyze an autoimmune response and the MS pathophysiology. In patients with MS, their T-cells may be unable to control EBV positive B-cells and plasma cells so that B-cells and plasma cells could then accumulate in the brain and generate antibodies that attack and destroy myelin, the protective layer that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This loss of myelin ultimately leads to MS symptoms. MS disease course has also been shown to correlate with measures of EBV activity. The role of B-cells in MS is supported by the recent approval by the FDA of ocrelizumab for PPMS which broadly targets B-cells through their expression of a cell surface marker known as CD20. Low vitamin D also suppresses T-cells and is associated with MS.
 Our second T-cell immunotherapy product candidate, ATA188, is an off-the-shelf EBV-specific T-cell that utilizes a targeted antigen recognition technology that enables the T-cells we administer to selectively identify cells expressing the EBV antigens that we believe are important for the potential treatment of MS. We are also developing an autologous version of this product candidate that we call ATA190. ATA190 utilizes the same approach to targeted antigen recognition as ATA188. These product candidates are designed to selectively target only those cells which are EBV positive while sparing those that are not. We believe that eliminating only EBV positive B-cells, including plasma cells, has the potential to benefit some patients with MS through enhanced efficacy and a better side-effect profile. In October 2015, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy product candidates targeting EBV, including ATA188, utilizing technology and know-how developed by QIMR Berghofer. In connection with this license, we also received an option to exclusively license the autologous version of EBV product candidates, including ATA190.
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated an open label, single arm, multi-center, multi-national Phase 1 trial with allogeneic ATA188 for patients with MS and in January 2018 received clearance of our investigational new drug, or IND, application from the FDA to proceed with patient enrollment at U.S. sites.  The primary objective of this Phase 1 trial is to assess the safety of ATA188 in patients followed for at least one year after the first dose. Key secondary endpoints in the trial include measures of clinical improvement such as Expanded Disability Status Scale, or EDSS, and annualized relapse rate, or ARR, as well as MRI imaging. The trial is expected to enroll a total of 60 patients across the United States, Australia and Europe: 30 patients with PMS, either PPMS or SPMS, and 30 patients with RRMS. We expect to announce results from our ATA188 Phase 1 trial in patients with PMS in the first half of 2019. 
 7


In addition, based on the Phase 1 clinical results observed to date with ATA190, we believe the continued development of ATA190 will enhance our understanding of the potential therapeutic utility of targeting EBV in the treatment of MS and further inform and complement our development of ATA188, and we are planning a multicenter Phase 1/2 trial with ATA190 in PMS.
 Our collaborating investigators at QIMR Berghofer are currently conducting a Phase 1 trial utilizing autologous ATA190 for the treatment of patients with PMS. We believe this is the first clinical trial to prospectively explore both the feasibility and potential utility of targeting EBV in MS. The trial is designed to:
 
 
• | enroll 10 patients: five with PPMS and five with SPMS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | assess the safety and tolerability of ATA190 in patients with PMS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | document preliminary evidence of efficacy through the evaluation of both clinically measured and patient reported changes in MS symptoms during and following treatment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determine if autologous ATA190 can be generated to clinical scale from the blood of patients with PMS.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each patient receives four escalating doses of ATA190 over six weeks, with each individual dose given once every two weeks. Patients are followed for 20 weeks after the last dose. An abstract from our collaborating investigators describing interim results from this Phase 1 trial was selected for inclusion in the Emerging Science Program during the 69th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in April 2017 and updated interim results for all ten patients were recently presented at the MSParis 2017 Congress, the 7th Joint Meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis and the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis.
 Results presented include data on five SPMS patients and five PPMS patients. Clinical improvements were reported in six of the ten patients treated and these improvements were observed within two to fourteen weeks after the first dose. Three patients improved their EDSS score. EDSS is a method for quantifying disability and monitoring changes over time. Reduction in fatigue was a consistent observation in responding patients. Five of the six patients who showed clinical improvements received ATA190 with greater than or equal to 7% EBV reactivity, or T-cell reactivity against target EBV antigens following manufacturing. This suggests that EBV reactivity may be an important product characterization metric for future development. ATA190 was well-tolerated, and no significant treatment-related adverse events were observed. A summary of study results is highlighted in the table below.
 
 
Subject Age/Gender (MS Type) | EDSS1 BL2/ Post Tx3 | | CD8+ T cell Reactivity to EBV | | Observed Improvement
60 yo F (SPMS) | | 6.5/6.0 | | 47% | | Yes 
60 yo M (PPMS) | | 5.0/3.5 | | 31% | | Yes 
49 yo F (PPMS) | | 8.0/8.0 | | 15% | | Yes 
61 yo M (SPMS) | | 6.5/6.5 | | 10% | | Equivocal 
55 yo F (PPMS) | | 5.0/4.5 | | 8% | | Yes—still in follow up
46 yo M (SPMS)4 | | 8.0/8.0 | | 7% | | Yes 
42 yo F (PPMS) | | 6.5/7.0 | | 3% | | None 
53 yo M (PPMS) | | 6.0/6.0 | | <1% | | None 
54 yo F (SPMS) | | 6.5/6.5 | | <1% | | None 
49 yo F (SPMS) | | 6.5/6.5 | | <1% | | Mild 


1 | EDSS = Expanded Disability Scale Score. 
2 | BL = Baseline EDSS score prior to treatment with ATA190. 
3 | Post Tx = EDSS score following treatment with ATA190. 
4 | This patient received ATA190 under a compassionate use protocol approximately 4 years prior to entry into the Phase 1 trial.

 Overall, we believe these results are encouraging and support the continued development of ATA188 and ATA190 in MS.
 ATA520 for hematologic malignancies
 Our third T-cell immunotherapy product candidate, ATA520, is an off-the-shelf  WT1 specific T-cell immunotherapy
, that targets cancers expressing the antigen WT1 and is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. WT1 is an intracellular protein that is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including hematological malignances as well as solid tumors. MSK has two Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating ATA520. The first trial is a dose escalation trial of ATA520 for residual or relapsed leukemia after HCT. The second trial is a dose escalation trial of ATA520 following T-cell depleted HCT for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including plasma cell leukemia, or PCL. Based on data from these trials, we intend to develop ATA520 in a select set of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Given the advances of our EBV-related pipeline programs in NPC and MS, as well as the opportunity to pursue a conditional marketing authorization in the EU for tabelecleucel, we expect to initiate an additional clinical trial with 
 8


ATA520 following the further process development of ATA520 as well as the clinical and regulatory advancement of tabelecleucel and ATA188.
 ATA230 for CMV viremia and disease
 Our fourth T-cell immunotherapy product candidate, ATA230, is an off-the-shelf CMV specific T-cell immunotherapy, that is in Phase 2 clinical trials for refractory CMV infection that occurs in some patients who have received an HCT or SOT or are otherwise immunocompromised. We met with the FDA for an end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss late stage development of ATA230 for the treatment of anti-viral refractory or resistant CMV infection following either HCT or SOT. Our collaborating investigators presented updated ATA230 results from 50 post-transplant patients with refractory CMV viremia and disease, including those with disease in the central nervous system, at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting in 
Atlanta, Georgia, in December 2017. Results reported include a response rate of approximately 60% in all patients, which was similar in those with CMV viremia and disease. Patients who responded to ATA230 showed improved 6- and 12-month survival rates of approximately 80% and 60%, respectively, versus those patients who did not respond to treatment. One of the 32 patients who responded died of CMV disease. ATA230 was generally well tolerated. Five patients experienced grade 4 or higher adverse events deemed possibility related to ATA230. Recently, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for ATA230 for the treatment of CMV viremia and disease in immunocompromised patients as well as Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of congenital CMV infect
ion. The EMA has also granted us orphan status for ATA230 for CMV infection in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity. Given the opportunity to pursue a CMA in the EU for tabelecleucel, we have decided to prioritize our EBV related programs ahead of ATA230 at this time, and plan to further evaluate our development strategy for ATA230 in 2018.
 ATA621 for BK and JC virus associated diseases
 Through our ongoing collaboration with QIMR Berghofer, we recently developed a new T-cell immunotherapy product candidate, ATA621, for BK and JC virus associated diseases. These two viruses are closely related and there are no available antiviral agents approved for use in BK or JC associated diseases. JC virus is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalo
pathy, or PML, which occurs in transplant, HIV and cancer patients as well as in patients treated with other immunosuppressive therapies, including certain therapies utilized for the treatment of MS. Based on our market research, we estimate that there are approximately 7,800 cases of PML annually, worldwide. BK virus is associated with hemorrhagic cystitis, or BKVHC, which mainly occurs following HCT or cyclophosphamide treatment as well as BK virus associated nephropathy, or BKVAN, which is a disease most commonly associated with kidney transplant. Based on Atara market research, we estimate that there are approximately 2,100 cases of BKVAN and 2,300 cases of BKVHC annually, worldwide. We are currently conducting investigational new drug application enabling manufacturing process development and plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial with ATA621 in 2019.

Our pipeline of product candidates is highlighted in the figure below.

Additional Platform Expansion Activities 
 We believe our T-cell technology platform will have utility beyond the current set of targets to which it has been directed. We expect to further research and develop additional cellular therapies, which may include T-cell programs targeted against other antigens as well as engineered T-cell immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, cell programs. We believe that viral antigens are well suited to adoptive immunotherapy given that people with normal immune systems are able to mount robust responses to these viral targets, but immunocompromised patients and some cancer patients are not. We also intend to license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies to enhance our existing T-cell technology platform. 
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our innovative technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and public and private research institutions. Some of these potential competitors may have a more established presence in the market and significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. 
T-Cell Product Candidates 
 Should our T-cell product candidates be approved for use, we will face substantial competition. In addition to the current standard of care for patients, commercial and academic clinical trials are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of immunotherapy. Early results from these trials have fueled continued interest in T-cell immunotherapy. In addition, if approved, our T-cell programs would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications.

EBV+ PTLD
There are currently no FDA or EMA approved products for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD. However, some approved products and therapies are currently used off-label in this setting. Companies and academic institutions that may license therapies to companies in the future are or may be developing new treatments. These therapies, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and clinical trial results of competitive products, could diminish the ability to market and sell tabelecleucel. The current treatment for EBV+ PTLD involves administration of rituximab as a single agent or in the SOT setting, in combination with chemotherapy regimens. Additionally, companies and academic institutions are developing drug candidates for EBV+ PTLD and other EBV associated diseases, including Cell Medica Ltd., or Cell Medica, which is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for baltaleucel-T, an autologous EBV specific T-cell therapy in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and Viracta Therapeutics, Inc., or Viracta, which has initiated Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for VRx-3996 in relapsed/refractory EBV+ lymphomas.
 Multiple Sclerosis
 Competition in the MS market is high with fourteen therapies approved for the treatment of RRMS in the United States and European Union.  There are many U.S. and international competitors in the RRMS market, including major multi-national fully-integrated pharmaceutical companies and established biotechnology companies.  Most recently, Ocrevus®, marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche, was approved for the t
reatment of relapsing MS in the United States and European Union.  There are numerous other development candidates in Phase 3 trials for RRMS including Novartis’ anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab; Alkermes’ monomethyl fumarate prodrug ALKS 8700; Tev
a’s laquinimod, and Actelion’s next-generation sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, or 
S1PR, agonist ponesimod.  Celgene recently reported positive results from Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ozamimod, a S1PR agonist, in relapsing MS.
 Only three therapies have been approved for the treatment of progressive MS.  Recently, Ocrevus® was approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of PPMS.  Extavia® (marketed by Novartis) is approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of SPMS.  Betaseron® (marketed by Bayer AG) is also approved in the European Union. Few therapies have been approved for progressive MS because many candidates have failed during clinical trial testing.  In the United States, there is one drug (mitoxantrone) approved to treat SPMS.  
 The SPMS and PPMS markets have active development pipelines and additional novel agents could be approved in the future.  Several development candidates are being evaluated in clinical trials including a number of Phase 3 programs: MedDay SA is evaluating MD-1003, a concentrated form of biotin, for progressive MS; AB Science is evaluating masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for progressive MS; and Novartis is evaluating siponimod, an S1P1 modulator, for SPMS; and Actelion Pharmaceuticals is evaluating ponesimod, for SPMS.  
 Multiple Myeloma including Plasma Cell Leukemia
 Several
 products are approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, or 
MM, 
including immunomodulatory drugs, or 
IMIDs, such as Thalomid® (Celgene Corporation), Revlimid® (Celgene Corporation) and Pomalyst® (Celgene Corporation); monoclonal antibodies such as Darzalex® (Janssen Research & Development, LLC) and Empliciti® (Bristol Myers Squibb); and proteasome inhibitors such as Velcade® (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and Kyprolis® (Amgen Inc.).
 A number of companies and institutions are pursuing development programs for relapsed or refractory MM.  These development programs include drug candidates being evaluated in clinical trials as a monotherapy or in combination with other approved agents.  In addition, many groups are developing novel T-cell therapies such as autologous CAR T-cell or autologous TCR T-cell candidates.  These include bluebird bio, Inc., which is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials testing bb2121, an anti-BCMA CART; Gilead Sciences, Inc., which is testing KTE-585, an anti-BCMA CART in Phase 1 clinical trials; Juno Therapeutics, which is testing an anti-BCMA CART in Phase 1 clinical trials; Autolus Limited, which is testing AUTO-2, a bi-specific anti-BCMA/TACI CART in Phase 1 clinical trials and Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, which is testing an anti-NY-ESO TCR in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.
 CMV Infection 
 There are numerous approved products and therapies for the treatment of CMV infection, and a number of companies and academic institutions that may license therapies to companies in the future are or may be developing new treatments for CMV infection. These therapies, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and clinical trial results of competitive products, could significantly diminish any ability to market and sell the CMV T-cell immunotherapy. Drug therapies approved or commonly used for CMV infection include antiviral compounds such as Prevymis®, marketed by Merck & Co. Inc.; ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. 
 11


Additionally, a number of companies and academic institutions are developing drug candidates for CMV infection and other CMV-associated diseases, including Shire Plc which is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of maribavir, a UL97 protein kinase inhibitor; Vical Inc., recently announced ASP0113, a therapeutic bivalent plasma DNA CMV vaccine being evaluated in patients undergoing an allogeneic stem cell transplant, failed to meet primary or secondary endpoints in Phase 3 clinical trials.  In addition, Helocyte, Inc., is conducting two Phase 2 clinical trials for a CMV MVA-vaccine and a CMV peptide vaccine in patients undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant; Merck is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for V160, a CMV DNA vaccine; VBI Vaccines Inc., has completed Phase 1 clinical trials for VBI-1501A, an eVLP vaccine; Hookipa Biotech, is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for HB101, a bivalent vaccine, ViraCyte, is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for Viralym-C, a CMV-specific allogeneic cell therapy product; Fate Therapeutics is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for ProTmune, a small molecule programmed mobilized peripheral blood graft; Chimerix is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for intravenous Brincidofovir (BCV IV), a nucleotide analog and Moderna Therapeutics is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for mRNA-1647, an mRNA based prophylactic vaccine.
 License Agreements 
 MSK Option and License Agreement 
 In September 2014, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with MSK under which we acquired the right to exclusively license from MSK the worldwide rights to three clinical stage T-cell programs. The initial option period was for 12 months. In exchange for the exclusive option, we paid MSK $1.25 million in cash and issued 59,761 shares of our common stock to MSK. We and MSK also agreed to collaborate on further research to develop additional cellular therapies, which may include T-cell programs targeted against other antigens and/or CAR-T, and which we also would hold an option to license, if developed. 
 In June 2015, we exercised the option and entered into a license agreement with MSK. Under the terms of the license agreement, MSK granted us a worldwide, exclusive license under certain patent rights, know-how and a library of T-cells and cell lines, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize T-cell products specific to CMV, EBV or WT1 that comprise or are based on or made using such licensed rights. MSK also agreed to transfer certain INDs related to the licensed products to us. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products and, if commercialized, continue active marketing efforts for any commercialized licensed product through the term of the license agreement. 
 In connection with the option exercise and the execution of the license agreement, we made an upfront cash payment to MSK of $4.5 million. We are obligated to make additional milestone payments of up to $33.0 million with respect to the three licensed clinical stage T-cell programs based on achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-related milestones. We are also required to make escalating mid to high single-digit royalty payments to MSK based on sales of any licensed products. In addition, under certain circumstances, we must make certain minimum annual royalty payments to MSK, which are creditable against earned royalties owed for the same annual period. We are also obligated to pay a low double-digit percentage of consideration we receive for sublicensing the licensed rights. 
 The license agreement expires for each licensed T-cell product on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis and a country-by-country basis, on the latest of: (i) expiration of the last licensed patent rights related to such licensed product in such country, (ii) expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by law with respect to such licensed product in such country, and (iii) a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. Upon expiration of the license agreement, the licenses granted to us will become non-exclusive royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable. MSK may terminate the license agreement if we materially breach the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified period or if we experience certain insolvency events.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide certain periods of regulatory exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See “Government Regulation.” 
 We seek composition-of-matter and/or associated method patents, including method-of-treatment patents, for each of our product candidates in key therapeutic areas. The United States patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.  A provisional patent application is not examined for patentability by the USPTO and automatically expires 12 
 12


months after its filing date.  As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into an issued patent.  Provisional patent applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early effective filing date for a later-filed non-provisional patent application.  A non-provisional patent application is examined by the USPTO and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards of patentability.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application, the priority date claimed and the legal term of patents as determined by the applicable law in the countries in which those patents are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Additionally, patent term adjustments can extend term to account for certain delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, during prosecution before that office. The duration of non-U.S. patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically, the life of a non-U.S. patent is 20 years from the earliest international filing date, not inclusive of any patent term extension that may be available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 National and international patent laws concerning protein-based biologics such as our products remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date among the United States, Europe and other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims for any patent and enforcing those claims once a patent is granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of any drug we may develop from our product candidates, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our product candidates are summarized below:
 Our global patent estate consists of both issued patents and pending patent applications and includes wholly-owned patent applications, in-licensed patents and patent applications to which we generally hold exclusive commercial rights, and patents and patent applications to which we hold an exclusive option to license commercial rights. Regarding our tabelecleucel for EBV+PTLD following HCT or SOT, tabelecleucel for NPC, ATA188, ATA190, ATA520, ATA230 and ATA621 programs, and our platform technologies underlying these programs, our global patent estate is directed to compositions of matter and/or associated methods, including methods of treatment, and consists of 25 patent families having a total of 95 issued patents or patent applications.  The issued patents and patent applications (if issued) of our global patent estate are expected to expire between 2023 and 2038, not inclusive of any patent term extension that may be available is any associated jurisdiction.
 Trade Secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by an employee. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or any unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Government Regulation 
 Overview of U.S. Government Regulation 
 The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. 
 Our T-cell immunotherapy product candidates, including tabelecleucel (formerly known as ATA129), are regulated by the FDA as biologics, reviewed by the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research, and will require the submission of BLAs and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. For T-cell immunotherapy trials conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the recombinant DNA advisory committee, or RAC, that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution. 
 The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish that the biological product is “safe, pure and potent”, which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP and in the case of our T-cell immunotherapy product candidates, good tissue practices, or GTP; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Before conducting studies in humans, laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate must be conducted. Preclinical toxicology studies in animals must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lend themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of safety concerns about the product candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. 
 All clinical trials for new drugs and biologics must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or 
 14


investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, and monitor the trial until completed. 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same product candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. 
 Phase 1 clinical studies may be conducted in a limited number of patients or healthy volunteers, as appropriate. The product candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. 
 Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial but are subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. The fees typically increase each year. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLA applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a product candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMP. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 
 Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, a statutory pathway has been created for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act. Also under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products. 
 15


Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP and GTP requirements, as applicable and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with these standards. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance. 
 Orphan Drug Act 
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 
 Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the United States, including in the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if the sponsor completes a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the EMA. 
 Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track and RMAT are processes designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although Fast Track, RMAT, and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. 
 In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, breakthrough therapy designation may be pursued. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review.
 Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing 
 16


cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current product candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service, or PHS, pharmaceutical pricing program and also seek to sell the products to federal agencies. 
 Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
 Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. 
 Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting, and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price. 
 Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS. 
 FFS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and paid for by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended to not exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than inflation. 
 To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. 
 The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which
 included changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspect
s of the Affordable Care Act
, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since 
January 2017, President Trump has 
signed two 
Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part 
of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes 
under the Affordable Care Act have been 
 17


enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain mandated fees under the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Congress also could consider additional legislation to repeal or replace other elements of the Affordable Care Act. Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we expect to be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. As with accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in the European Union is permitted based on incomplete clinical data for a limited number of medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under EU law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions.
 As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 11 years of exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, initiative was established by the EMA to help promote and foster the development of new medicines in the European Union that demonstrate potential for a major therapeutic advantage in areas of unmet medical need. Benefits from the PRIME designation include early confirmation of potential for accelerated assessment, early dialogue and increased interaction with relevant regulatory committees to discuss development options, scientific advice at key development milestones, and proactive regulatory support from the EMA.

Additional Regulation 
 As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. 
 Manufacturing
 Our initial strategy is to outsource the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. In selecting contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture our product candidates, we generally strive to select the CMO based on the particular technical needs of the product candidate and quality and regulatory compliance. In addition, we aim to work with CMOs that possess the requisite scale, expertise and experience to support clinical as well as commercial product manufacturing. We have transferred the manufacturing processes for tabelecleucel (formerly known as ATA129) from MSK to our CMO.  The transfer of manufacturing processes to our CMO includes modifications to the processes, improvements in the manufacturing process as well as product testing. Moreover, we are currently developing commercial-scale manufacturing processes for tabelecleucel for the Phase 3 trials, with the proposed dose and schedule to be used in clinical practice and at a cost sufficient to support profitable commercialization. In December 2017, following discussion with the FDA of manufacturing and comparability data generated on material manufactured by our contract manufacturing organization, we initiated these trials in the United States.
We are building our own manufacturing facility, which is designed to support clinical production and ultimately commercialization of tabelecleucel, if approved.  In addition, we would expect our facility to support the supply needs for our other cellular therapy product candidates.  We would expect to maintain our relationships with our CMOs in order to have redundant sources of supply.  Our internal capabilities and experience in manufacturing encompass a broad range of activities including cell line development, process, analytical and formulation development, clinical and commercial scale GMP manufacturing, quality control and quality assurance. We are building the internal technical expertise in the manufacture of cellular therapeutics through hiring well experienced staff.  This breadth of experience will allow us to effectively oversee our own manufacturing facility as well as direct the activities of our contract manufacturers and testing facilities. Benefits of owning our own facility may include improved cost of goods, increased control and oversight of manufacturing and supply chain activities, greater control over maintenance and management of production capacity across multiple products, development of redundant supply capabilities to reduce risk, and reduced reliance on third parties.
 Our T-cell product candidates require blood from healthy, consenting third-party donors as starting materials. The manufacturing process involves co-culturing and incubating viral or cancer specific antigen transformed B-cells collected from the blood of third party-donors with T-cells collected from the same donor, all under Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs. GTPs are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. 
 Pursuant to our June 2015 license agreement with MSK, we acquired the right to use certain manufacturing process know-how related to producing clinical research-related drug supply. This included materials to support the manufacturing of clinical trial material including key starting materials and intermediates as well as existing inventory of clinical trial materials.  We have also entered into a supply agreement with a third party to ensure we have the necessary blood donated from healthy consenting third-party donors.
