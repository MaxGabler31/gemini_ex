Overview
We are primarily an agribusiness company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 15,400 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate and capital investment activities.
Agribusiness activities are performed through these four reporting segments:
We are one of California’s oldest citrus growers. According to Sunkist Growers, Inc. (“Sunkist”), we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the United States and, according to the California Avocado Commission, one of the largest growers of avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, Tulare, San Luis Obispo and San Bernardino Counties in California, Yuma County in Arizona, La Serena, Chile and Jujuy, Argentina, which collectively consist of approximately 5,600 acres of lemons, 900 acres of avocados, 1,000 acres of oranges and 1,000 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons that we grow, as well as lemons grown by others. We have a 47% interest in Rosales S.A. (“Rosales”), a citrus packing, marketing and sales business, a 90% interest in Fruticola Pan de Azucar S.A. (“PDA”), a lemon and orange orchard and a 100% interest in Agricola San Pablo SpA. ("San Pablo"), a lemon and orange orchard, all of which are located near La Serena, Chile. We have a 51% interest in a joint venture, Trapani Fresh Consorcio de Cooperacion ("Trapani Fresh"), a lemon orchard in Argentina.
Our water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We use ground water from the San Joaquin Valley Basin and water from local water and irrigation districts in Tulare County, which is in California’s San Joaquin Valley. We also use ground water from the Cadiz Valley Basin in California’s San Bernardino County and surface water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District (“YMIDD”). We use ground water provided by wells and surface water for our PDA and San Pablo farming operations in Chile and our Trapani Fresh farming operations in Argentina.
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic investments in California agriculture and real estate. We currently have an interest in two real estate development projects in California. These projects include multi-family housing, single-family homes and apartments of approximately 900 units in various stages of planning and development.
Fiscal Year 2022 Highlights and Recent Developments
We are equal partners in a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (“Lewis”) for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project and formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC ("LLCB") as the development entity. LLCB has closed on lot sales representing 586 units from inception through October 31, 2022. In October 2022, we entered 
 5


into a joint venture with Lewis for the development of our 17-acre East Area I Retained Property (“Retained Property”). We formed LLCB II, LLC ("LLCB II") as the development entity, contributed our Retained Property to the joint venture and sold a 50% interest to Lewis for $8.0 million. We recorded a gain on the transaction of approximately $4.7 million, of which $0.5 million was deferred. The joint venture partners will share in the capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the project. In connection with the closing, we amended LLCB’s Limited Liability Company Agreement to provide that LLCB is to include the processing of final approval for additional residential units to be developed and constructed on the Retained Property. For further information see Note 5 – Real Estate Development.
In September 2021, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc. ("Wileman"), to form an alliance to sell their combined citrus volumes under Limoneira's One World of Citrus trademark. Wileman is a 95-year-old citrus business located in California’s Central Valley with a focus on oranges, mandarins and specialty citrus. Effective November 1, 2021, the majority of our oranges and certain specialty citrus are packed by Wileman. 
In January 2022, we were notified of Alex M. Teague’s decision to retire as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Company, effective February 1, 2022. In connection with his retirement, we entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Teague whereas, (i) Mr. Teague was paid one year of his annual base salary, which was paid in one lump sum within 90 business days of January 12, 2022; (ii) 23,999 shares of our common stock granted to Mr. Teague pursuant to the Limoneira Company Omnibus Incentive Plan fully vested; and (iii) Mr. Teague received certain other benefits as set forth in the agreement. In fiscal year 2022, Mr. Teague received $0.4 million cash severance and $0.3 million accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.
In February 2022, we terminated our Avocado Marketing Agreement and the associated Letter Agreement Regarding Fruit Commitment with Calavo to pursue opportunities with other packing and marketing companies.
In March 2022, we signed an agreement to lease Finca Santa Clara, our 1,200-acre lemon ranch in Argentina, to FGF Trapani ("FGF"), our 49% partner in Trapani Fresh. The lease is retroactive beginning November 1, 2021, with a term of 14 months at a fixed sum of $0.4 million, payable in five equal, monthly installments from August 2022 through December 2022. We expect to extend the lease agreement for an additional year.
In April 2022, the promissory note previously received for the sale of our Centennial property, with a net carrying value of $2.4 million, was paid in full and the deferred gain of $0.2 million was recognized.
In June 2022, we engaged with YMIDD in a two-year fallowing and forbearance program at our Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. ("Associated") ranch in Yuma, Arizona. We expect to receive payments totaling approximately $1.3 million during the program. With the fallowing program in place, this ranch will have approximately 700 acres of productive lemons, 400 fallowed acres and 200 acres of other crops.
In October 2022, we sold our Oxnard Lemon property and packing facility located in Ventura County, California. We received net proceeds of $19.1 million and recognized a gain of approximately $0.8 million. Concurrent with the closing of the sale, we entered into a lease agreement to continue our use of the property as a lessee for a period of 36 months from the closing date, with extension options for an additional 24 months. 
On December 20, 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share payable on January 13, 2023, in the aggregate amount of $1.3 million to stockholders of record as of January 3, 2023. 
In fiscal year 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sevilla property for $2.7 million, which closed on November 30, 2022. We received net proceeds of $2.6 million and recorded an immaterial loss in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the industries and markets in which we conduct business. In particular, the United States lemon market saw a significant decline in volume, with lemon demand falling since widespread shelter in place orders were issued in March 2020, resulting in a significant market oversupply. The export market for fresh produce also significantly declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. As of October 31, 2022, the demand within both markets is recovering but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.
The decline in demand for our products beginning the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which we believe was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted our sales and profitability for the last three quarters of fiscal year 2020 and all of fiscal years 2021 and 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic may impact our sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be estimated at this time, as they are influenced by a number of factors, many of which are outside management’s control, including, but not limited, to those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual 
 6


Report. Notwithstanding the adverse impacts and subject to unforeseen changes that may arise as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we currently expect improvement in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022.
Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past three years, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including temporarily postponing capital expenditures, selling equity securities to increase cash, reducing operating costs, substantially reducing discretionary spending and strategically selling certain assets.
There is continued uncertainty around the breadth and duration of our business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy and the ongoing business operations of our customers. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2023 and beyond cannot be fully estimated at this point. The following discussions are subject to the future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing business operations.
Business Division Summary 
We have three business divisions: agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development. The agribusiness division is comprised of four reportable operating segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness, which includes oranges, specialty citrus and other crops. The agribusiness division includes our core operations of farming, harvesting, lemon packing and citrus sales operations. The rental operations division includes our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The real estate development division includes our investments in real estate development projects. Financial information and discussion of our four reportable segments are contained in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report.

Farming
Lemons. We market and sell lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, Europe and certain other international markets. We are one of the largest lemon growers in the United States with approximately 5,600 acres of lemons planted primarily in Ventura, Tulare and San Bernardino Counties in California and in Yuma County, Arizona. In California, the lemon growing area stretches from the Coachella Valley to Fresno and Monterey Counties, with the majority of the growing areas located in the coastal areas from Ventura County to Monterey County. Ventura County is California’s top lemon producing county. Approximately 29% of our lemons are grown in Ventura County, 20% are grown in Tulare County, 12% are grown in Yuma County, Arizona and 11% are grown in San Bernardino County, California. We also grow approximately 9% of our lemons near La Serena, Chile and 19% of our lemons in Argentina.
There are many varieties of lemons, with the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa being the predominant varieties marketed on a worldwide basis. Approximately 88% of our lemon plantings are of the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa varieties and approximately 12% are of other varieties such as sweet Meyer lemons, Proprietary Seedless lemons and Pink Variegated lemons. California-grown lemons are available throughout the year, with peak production periods occurring from January through August. The storage life of fresh lemons generally ranges from one to 18 weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
Avocados. We are one of the largest avocado growers in the United States with approximately 900 acres of avocados planted throughout Ventura County. In California, the avocado growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County.
California-grown avocados have peak production periods occurring between February and July. Other avocado varieties have a more limited picking season and typically command a lower price. Because of superior eating quality, the Hass avocado has contributed greatly to the avocado’s growing popularity through its retail, restaurant and other food service uses. Approximately 
 8


95% of our avocado plantings are of the Hass variety. The storage life of fresh avocados generally ranges from one to four weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
Through fiscal year 2021, the Company sold the majority of its avocado production to Calavo Growers, Inc. (“Calavo”), a packing and marketing company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CVGW. In February 2022, the Company terminated its Avocado Marketing Agreement and the associated Letter Agreement Regarding Fruit Commitment with Calavo to pursue opportunities with other packing and marketing companies.
Primarily due to differing soil conditions, the care of avocado trees is intensive. The need for more production per acre to compete with foreign sources of supply has required us to take an important lead in the practice of dense planting (typically four times the number of avocado trees per acre versus traditional avocado plantings) and mulching composition to help trees acclimate under conditions that more closely resemble those found in the tropics, a better climate for avocado growth.
Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops. We have approximately 1,000 acres of oranges planted primarily in Tulare County, California. In California, the growing area for oranges stretches from Imperial County to Yolo County. California-grown Navel oranges are available from October to June, with peak production periods occurring between January and April. Approximately 96% of our orange plantings are of the Navel variety and approximately 4% are of the Valencia variety. We estimate approximately 70% of our oranges are sold to retail customers and approximately 30% are sold to wholesale customers. We currently have approximately 1,000 acres of specialty citrus and other crops planted such as Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios and wine grapes.
We utilize third-party packinghouses to process and pack our oranges and specialty citrus. A portion of our oranges and specialty citrus is marketed and sold under the Sunkist brand by Sunkist and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses. As an agricultural cooperative, Sunkist coordinates the sales and marketing of the oranges and specialty citrus and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses for direct shipment to customers.
We currently market our other crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, utilizing processors that are not members of agricultural cooperatives. Our pistachios are harvested and sold to a roaster, packager and marketer of nuts, and our wine grapes are sold to various wine producers.

The Limoneira/Olivelands Ranch is the original site of our Company. Our headquarters, lemon packing operations and storage facilities are located on this property.
The Teague McKevett Ranch is the site of our real estate development project known as East Area I and described below under the “Real Estate Development Summary” heading.
The other agribusiness land in the table above includes corporate and lemon packing facilities, land leased to other agricultural businesses, rental units, roads, creeks, hillsides and other open land.
Our orchards can maintain production for many years. For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate our orchards from 20 to 40 years depending on the fruit variety with the majority of our orchards depreciated over 20 to 30 years. We regularly evaluate our orchards’ production and growing costs and based on these and other factors, we may decide to redevelop certain orchards. In addition, we may acquire agricultural property with existing productive orchards or without productive orchards, which would require new orchard plantings. The fruit varieties that we grow are typically non-producing for approximately the first four to five years after the year of planting. Orchards may continue producing fruit longer than their depreciable lives. The following table presents the number of acres planted by fruit variety and approximate age of our orchards:

 | Age of Orchards
 | 0-5 Years | 6-25 Years | | Over 25 Years | Total

Lemon Packing and Sales
We are one of the oldest continuous lemon packing operations in North America. We pack and sell lemons grown by us as well as lemons grown by others, the operations of which are included in our financial statements under the lemon packing segment. Lemons delivered to our packinghouse in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona are sized, graded, cooled, ripened and packed for delivery to customers. Our ability to accurately estimate the size, grade and timing of the delivery of the annual lemon crop has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit.
A significant portion of the costs related to our lemon packing operation is fixed. We invest considerable time and research into refining and improving our lemon packing through innovation and are continuously searching for new techniques to refine how premium lemons are delivered to our consumers. Our strategy for growing the profitability of our lemon packing operations calls for optimizing the percentage of a crop that goes to the fresh market, or fresh utilization, and procuring a larger percentage of the California and Arizona lemon crop.
Rental Operations Summary
Our rental operations include our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. 
We own and maintain 257 residential housing units located mainly in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California that we lease to employees, former employees and non-employees. We also own several commercial office buildings. These properties generate reliable cash flows that we use to partially fund the operating cost's of our business. As of October 31, 2022, we lease approximately 500 acres of our land to third-party agricultural tenants who grow a variety of row crops. Our leased land business provides us with a profitable method to diversify the use of our land. We also partner with one of our tenants and have an organic recycling facility on our land in Ventura County. Effective November 1, 2021, we also lease our 1,200 acre Santa Clara ranch in Argentina.
Real Estate Development Summary
We invest in real estate development projects and recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. Our goal is to redeploy real estate earnings and cash flow into the expansion of our agribusiness and other income producing real estate. For real estate development projects and joint ventures, it is not unusual for the timing and amounts of revenues and costs, partner contributions and distributions, project loans, other financing assumptions and project cash flows to be 
 10


impacted by government approvals, project revenue and cost estimates and assumptions, economic conditions, financing sources and product demand as well as other factors. Such factors could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic real estate investments in California agricultural and developable real estate. Our current real estate developments include developable land parcels, multi-family housing and single-family homes with approximately 900 units in various stages of planning and development. The following is a summary of each of the strategic real estate investment properties in which we own an interest:
East Area I - Santa Paula, California. East Area I consists of 523 acres that we historically used as agricultural land and is located in Santa Paula approximately ten miles from the City of Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. This property was formerly known as our Teague McKevett Ranch. East Area I is the location for our master planned community of commercial and residential properties, named Harvest at Limoneira, designed to satisfy expected demand in a region that we believe will have few other developments in this coming decade. 
In November 2015, we entered into a joint venture with Lewis for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed LLCB as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the joint venture and sold a 50% interest in the joint venture to Lewis for $20.0 million. The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading in November 2017. Project plans include approximately 1,500 residential units and site improvements. A total of 586 residential units have closed from the project's inception to October 31, 2022. 
In October 2022, we entered into another joint venture with Lewis for the development of our 17-acre East Area I Retained Property (“Retained Property”), which is located within the East Area I property. We formed LLCB II, LLC as the development entity, contributed our Retained Property to the joint venture and sold a 50% interest to Lewis for approximately $8.0 million. In connection with the closing, we amended LLCB’s Limited Liability Company Agreement to provide that LLCB is to include the processing of final approval for additional residential units to be developed and constructed on the Retained Property. 
The joint venture partners will share in capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the projects. Since inception, each partner has made funding contributions of $21.4 million to LLCB. We expect to receive approximately $115.0 million from LLCB and LLCB II over the seven remaining years of the projects, including the $8.0 million received in fiscal year 2022.
 11


East Area II - Santa Paula, California. Our design associates and we are in the process of formulating plans for East Area II, a parcel of approximately 30 acres adjacent to East Area I. In July 2021, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell approximately 25 acres of our East Area II property in five staged purchases to an investment company for the purpose of constructing a medical campus consisting of medical office buildings and an acute care hospital. Completion of the transaction is subject to the execution of a purchase and sale agreement and resolution of certain contingencies. 
Santa Maria - Santa Barbara County, California. As of October 31, 2022, we were invested in one entitled development parcel, Sevilla, located in Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County, California. In fiscal year 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sevilla property for $2.7 million, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Markets and Competitive Strengths
Agribusiness Operations
With agricultural operations dating back to 1893, we are one of California’s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. Consequently, we have developed significant experience with a variety of crops, mainly lemons, avocados and oranges. The following is a brief list of what we believe are our significant competitive strengths with respect to our agribusiness operations:
•Our agricultural properties in Ventura County are located near the Pacific Ocean, which provides an ideal environment for growing lemons, avocados and row crops. Our agricultural properties in Tulare County, which is in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, and in Yuma, Arizona, are also located in areas that are well-suited for growing citrus crops.
•Historically, a higher percentage of our crops goes to the fresh market, which is commonly referred to as fresh utilization, than that of other growers and packers with which we compete.
•We have contiguous and nearby land resources that permit us to efficiently use our agricultural land and resources.
•In all but one of our properties, we are not dependent on State or Federal water projects to support our agribusiness or real estate development operations.
•We own approximately 94% of our agricultural land and take a long view on our fruit production practices.
•A significant amount of our agribusiness property was acquired many years ago, which results in a low-cost basis and associated expenses.
•In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, our integrated business model with respect to growing, packing, marketing and selling citrus allows us to better serve our customers.
 12


•Our lemon packing operations provide marketing opportunities with other citrus companies and their respective products.
•We have made investments in ground-based solar projects that provide us with tangible and intangible non-revenue generating benefits. The electricity generated by these investments provides us with a significant portion of the electricity required to operate our packinghouse and cold storage facilities located in Santa Paula, California and provides a significant portion of the electricity required to operate four deep-water well pumps at one of our ranches in Tulare County, California. Additionally, these investments support our sustainable agricultural practices, reduce our dependence on fossil-based electricity generation and lower our carbon footprint. Moreover, electricity that we generate and do not use is conveyed seamlessly back to the investor-owned utilities operating in these two markets. Finally, over time, we expect that our customers and the end consumers of our fruit will value the investments that we have made in renewable energy as a part of our farming and packing operations, which we believe may help us differentiate our products from similar commodities.
•We have made various other investments in water rights and mutual water companies. We own shares in the following mutual water companies: Farmers Irrigation Co., Canyon Irrigation Co., San Cayetano Mutual Water Co., Middle Road Mutual Water Co. and Pioneer Water Company, Inc. Additionally, we acquired water rights in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer), the YMIDD and in Chile.
Real Estate Development Operations
With respect to our real estate development operations, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:
•We have entitlements to build approximately 1,500 residential units in our East Area I development.
•We have partnered with an experienced and financially strong land developer for our East Area I residential master plan development.
•Several of our agricultural and real estate investment properties are unique and carry longer-term development potential.
•Our East Area II property has approximately 30 acres of land commercially zoned, which is adjacent to our East Area I property.
Business Strategy
We are an agribusiness and real estate development company that generates revenue and annual cash flows to support investments in agricultural efficiencies and acquisitions and real estate development activities. As our agricultural and non-strategic real estate development investments are monetized, we intend to use the cash flow to reduce existing debt, fund acquisitions, invest in farming efficiencies and expand packing capacities through our One World of Citrus Asset Light Business Model. We will also use more third-party grower and supplier fruit to reduce the impact of pricing volatility and rising farming costs. 
We believe the asset-lighter model will enable us to achieve revenue and cash flow growth by reducing investment risk in North and South America, generating more stable and higher growth in cash flow and earnings, and improving our annual return on invested capital.
The following describes the key elements of our business strategy.
Agribusiness
With respect to our agribusiness operations, key elements of our strategy are:
•Expand our One World of Citrus Asset Light Business Model in three main channels:
◦Growing, packing, marketing and distributing fruit grown on our properties;
◦Utilizing third-party fruit by packing, marketing and distributing their fruit through Limoneira channels; and
◦Marketing and distributing brokered fruit.
We intend to strategically sell certain assets to reduce existing debt, fund acquisitions, increase farming efficiencies and expand packing capabilities. Increased volume of fruit sales is expected to be fueled by sourcing from third-party growers and suppliers, thus mitigating the volatility that commodity pricing has on growers.
•Expand our Sources of Lemon Supply.  Peak lemon production occurs at different times of the year depending on geographic region. In addition to our lemon production in California and Arizona and lemons we acquire from domestic 
 13


third-party growers and suppliers, we have expanded our lemon supply sources to international markets such as Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Increases in lemons procured from third-party growers and suppliers and international sources improve our ability to provide our customers with fresh lemons throughout the year.
•Increase the Volume of our Lemon Packing Operations.  We regularly monitor our costs for redundancies and opportunities for cost reductions. In this regard, cost per carton is a function of throughput. We continually seek to acquire additional lemons from third-party growers and suppliers to pack through our packing facilities. Third-party growers and suppliers are only added if we determine their fruit is of good quality and can be cost effective for both the grower and us. Of most importance is the overall fresh utilization rate for our fruit, which is directly related to quality.
•Expand International Sales and Marketing of Lemons.  We estimate that we currently have approximately 10% of the fresh lemon market in the United States and a larger share of the United States lemon export market. We intend to explore opportunities to expand our international sales and marketing of lemons. We have the ability to supply a wide range of customers and markets and, because we produce high quality lemons, we can export our lemons to international customers, which many of our competitors are unable to supply.
•Opportunistically Expand our Plantings of Avocados.  Our plantings of avocados have been profitable and have been pursued to diversify our product line. Agricultural land that we believe is not suitable for lemons is typically planted with avocados, oranges, specialty citrus or other crops. While we may expand our avocados, we expect to do so on an opportunistic basis in locations that we believe offer a record of historical profitability.
Other Operations
With respect to our rental operations and real estate development activities, key elements of our strategy include the following:
•Selectively Secure Additional Rental and Housing Units.  Our housing, commercial and land rental operations provide us with a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to fund our overall activities. Additionally, we believe our housing rental operation allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees. 
•Opportunistically Lease Land to Third-Party Crop Farmers.  We regularly monitor the profitability of our fruit-producing acreage to ensure acceptable per acre returns. When we determine that leasing the land to third-party row crop farmers would be more profitable than farming the land, we intend to seek third-party row crop tenants.
•Opportunistically Expand our Income-Producing Commercial and Industrial Rental Assets.  We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties.
•Selectively and Responsibly Develop our Agricultural Land. We recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. We thus intend to maintain our position as a responsible agricultural landowner and major employer in Ventura County while focusing our real estate development activities on those agricultural land parcels that we believe offer the best opportunities to demonstrate our long-term vision for our community.
Customers
We market and sell our lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers in the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, Europe and certain other international markets. We sold lemons to approximately 200 U.S. and international customers during fiscal year 2022. We sell our avocados, oranges, specialty citrus and other crops to third-party packinghouses and our wine grapes to wine producers.
Competition
The agribusiness crop markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Generally, there are a large number of global producers that sell through joint marketing organizations and cooperatives. Fruit is also sold to independent packers, both public and private, who then sell to their own customer base. Customers are typically large retail chains, food service companies, industrial manufacturers and distributors who sell and deliver to smaller customers in local markets throughout the world. In the purest sense, our largest competitors in our agribusiness segments are other citrus and avocado producers in California, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Florida, a number of which are members of cooperatives such as Sunkist or have selling relationships with third-party

packinghouses similar to that of Limoneira. Our lemons and oranges also compete with other fruits and vegetables for the share of consumer expenditures devoted to fresh fruit and vegetables: apples, pears, melons, pineapples and other tropical fruit. Avocado products compete in the supermarket with hummus products and other dips and salsas. For our specific crops, the size of the U.S. market is approximately $661 million for lemons, both fresh and juice, approximately $340 million for avocados, and approximately $1.6 billion for oranges, both fresh and juice. Competition in the various agribusiness markets is affected by reliability of supply, product quality, brand recognition and perception, price and the ability to satisfy changing customer preferences through innovative product offerings.
The sale and leasing of residential, commercial and industrial real estate is very competitive, with competition coming from numerous and varied sources throughout California. Our greatest direct competition for each of our current real estate development properties in Ventura County comes from other residential and commercial developments in nearby areas.
Resources and Raw Materials
In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, paper is considered a material raw product for our business because most of our products are packed in cardboard cartons for shipment. Paper is readily available and we have numerous suppliers for such material. In our agribusiness division, petroleum-based products such as herbicides and pesticides are considered raw materials and we have numerous suppliers for these products.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous trademarks and brands under which we market and sell our fruits, particularly lemons, domestically and internationally, many of which have been owned for decades. The material brands of Limoneira lemons include, but are not limited to, One World of Citrus®, Santa®, Paula®, Bridal Veil®, Fountain®, Golden Bowl® and Level®. These trademarks are owned by us and registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also acquired certain lemon brands with acquisitions, including Kiva®, Kachina®, Oxnard Lemon and Trapani Fresh.
Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations are predominantly seasonal in nature. The harvest and sale of our lemons, avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops occurs in all quarters, but is generally more concentrated during our third quarter. Our lemons are generally grown and marketed throughout the year, our avocados are primarily sold from January through August, our oranges are primarily sold from January through June, our specialty citrus is primarily sold from November through April and our other crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, are primarily sold in September and October.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our agribusiness and real estate development divisions are subject to a broad range of evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For example, the growing, packing, storing and distributing of our products is extensively regulated by various federal and state agencies. The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees our packing and processing of lemons and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern the use of pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties. Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance. We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations for necessary permits and licenses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. These remedies can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our residential units provide affordable housing to many of our employees, including our agribusiness employees. Employees live close to their work, which reduces traffic and commuting times. This unique employment benefit helps us maintain a dependable, long-term employee base. We partner with some local schools to provide transportation for residents.
