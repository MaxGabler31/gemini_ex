ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR MISSION

Envela’s mission is to empower recommerce buyers and sellers to extend the useful life of goods by reselling previously owned or used goods, or recycling goods’ materials, elements or components for sale and reuse.
OVERVIEW

Envela is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in the recommercialization of goods. Envela’s recommerce operations in each subsidiary reconditions previously owned or used goods for resale, or recycles products’ value by extracting materials, elements or components that can be sold. Envela’s recommerce businesses are conducted on both a retail basis and a wholesale basis through distributors, resellers, brick-and-mortar stores and online. Envela’s subsidiaries also operate a number of other related businesses and brands engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Envela is domiciled in the state of Nevada, and its corporate headquarters are located in Irving, Texas.
OPERATING SEGMENTS

Envela operates through two recommerce business segments represented by its two direct subsidiaries. DGSE, LLC (“DGSE”) focuses on the recommercialization of luxury hard assets, and ECHG, LLC (“ECHG”) focuses on the recommercialization of business IT equipment and consumer electronic devices.

DGSE operates the Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange, Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange and Bullion Express brands and primarily buys and resells or recycles luxury hard assets like jewelry, diamonds, gemstones, fine watches, rare coins and related collectibles, precious-metal bullion products, gold, silver and other precious-metals. Buying and selling items for their precious-metal content is a major method by which DGSE markets itself. DGSE also offers jewelry repair services, custom-made jewelry and consignment items, and maintains relationships with refiners for precious-metal items that are not appropriate for resale. 

ECHG owns and operates Echo Environmental Holdings, LLC (“Echo”), ITAD USA Holdings, LLC (“ITAD USA”), Teladvance, LLC (“Teladvance”), CEX Holdings, LLC (“CEX”) and Avail Recovery Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Avail DE”), through which it primarily buys and resells or recycles consumer electronic components and IT equipment. Echo focuses on end-of-life electronics recycling and sustainability, ITAD USA provides IT equipment disposition, including compliance and data sanitization services, Teladvance, CEX and Avail DE operate as value-added resellers by providing offerings and services to companies looking either to upgrade capabilities or dispose of equipment. Like DGSE, ECHG also maintains relationships with refiners or recyclers to which it sells valuable materials it extracts from electronics and IT equipment that are not appropriate for resale or reuse.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Envela revised the way it reviews its financial information to align more closely with its strategy to engage in diverse recommerce activities through the two principal business segments mentioned above—DGSE and ECHG. Although our Company’s overall strategy is recommerce, we feel there are distinct segments within recommerce. DGSE buys luxury hard assets, and ECHG buys consumer electronics and IT equipment, either for resale or recycling. Envela will continue to report its revenue and operating expenses based on its DGSE and ECHG operating segments. 

Envela includes segment information in the notes to the financial statements. The objective of segment reporting is to provide a management approach that identifies different types of businesses within Envela and how it has organized the segments to make financial decisions.

DGSE SEGMENT

DGSE buys to resell or recycle luxury hard assets, including jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, rare coins and currency, precious-metal bullion as well as items for their precious-metals content, and other valuables. DGSE reconditions items for resale as a whole good or component parts, or recycles them by selling recovered precious metals to refiners. These metals include gold, silver, platinum and palladium, with gold constituting the majority of our purchases and resales. DGSE resells through its retail locations or wholesale contacts. Where resale or wholesale is not appropriate, such as for crafted precious-metal items at the end of their useful lives, the items are sent to a third-party refiner and analyzed for metal content, after which they can be recycled and either sold or recrafted into new jewelry or bullion products. In addition to purchase and resale, DGSE offers on-site jewelry and watch repair and restoration services at its Dallas flagship location, located at 13022 Preston Road, Dallas, Texas 75240, and also partners with a number of consignment vendors which expands offerings at DGSE’s retail locations. DGSE also designs and offers custom bridal and fashion jewelry. As referenced above, DGSE also purchases items for their precious-metal content. Buying and selling precious metal is a major method by which DGSE markets itself.

For over 40 years, DGSE has been a destination location for those seeking value and liquidity in reselling or trading jewelry, and in recycling the precious metals of items it determines are not appropriate to sell as a whole good or as component parts. DGSE’s in-house staff of experts, including horologists, gemologists and authenticators, inspect items for authenticity and value, and share their market knowledge with its customers.

DGSE operates seven retail locations: six Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange stores throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and one Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange store in Mt Pleasant, South Carolina. In the fourth quarter of 2020, DGSE moved its Southlake, Texas location to Grapevine, Texas, and opened a new location in Lewisville, Texas—both suburbs of Dallas. DGSE purchased its Grapevine and Lewisville buildings. During 2021, DGSE purchased and renovated its newest retail location in Frisco, Texas—also a suburb of Dallas. The Frisco location was opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. DGSE leases its store in Charleston, South Carolina and three other locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. DGSE’s Dallas flagship location offers on-site jewelry-repair and watch-restoration services. 

We believe that the most successful DGSE locations will be those that can sustain our full retail “exchange” model: engaging in both buying and selling luxury hard assets and maintaining a robust and diverse inventory across all jewelry categories, fine watches and monetary collectibles. Helping to extend the life of luxury goods, our stores offer repair and restoration services for jewelry and watches. Examples of luxury hard assets that we buy and sell are estate and designer jewelry, fine timepieces, rare and numismatic coins, diamonds, gold, silver and other precious metals. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis—DGSE Precious Metals Pricing and Business Impact” for more information. 

In recent years, DGSE has maintained brick-and-mortar stores throughout Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, making our experts accessible to provide our customers guidance and insight. We are now focusing on bringing the DGSE experience to a wider customer base through an expanded footprint. Brick-and-mortar expansion remains a top priority and strong growth opportunity for DGSE. Purchasing the Lewisville, Grapevine and Frisco stores are part of that focus. We want to continue adding new merchandise daily to an already inviting product selection and providing omnichannel and immersive consumer experiences to customers in existing and new locations. 

We will continue to focus on evolving our business across the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and in Charleston, South Carolina in an effort to drive efficiency across our geographical footprint and maximize profitability.

DGSE views e-commerce as a supplement, but not a replacement, to its retail locations and other operations. For more information, see “—Sales and Marketing” below.

ECHG SEGMENT

ECHG owns and operates Echo, ITAD USA, Teladvance and now through two asset purchases during Fiscal 2021, CEX Holdings, LLC (“CEX”) and Avail Recovery Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Avail DE”). through which it buys to resell or recycle consumer electronics and IT equipment from businesses and other organizations, such as school districts. Items designated for resale as a whole or as component parts get extended operational life by first having any existing data erased and then being refurbished before resale. ECHG recycles goods by removing usable components for resale as components, or by extracting the valuable metals (or other materials) for sale to downstream recycling and refining companies that further process the metal or other materials for subsequent resale. Our customers include companies and organizations that are based both domestically and internationally. A significant amount of ECHG’s refining revenue comes through Echo from a refining partner with an international refining facility.

ECHG’s goal is to extend the useful life of electronics through recommerce whenever possible. Resale and reuse conserves energy and raw materials required to make new products and turns obsolete IT assets into revenue. 

CEX was formed in connection with the purchase of the assets of CExchange, LLC a Texas limited liability company (“CExchange”), on June 9, 2021 (the “CExchange Transaction”). Avail DE was formed in connection with the purchase of the assets of Avail Recovery Solutions, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company (“Avail AZ”) on October 29, 2021 (the “Avail Transaction”).

Echo operates out of a leased warehouse in Carrollton, Texas. Teladvance, ITAD and CEX operate out of a separate warehouse in Carrollton, TX that was originally assigned in connection with the CExchange Transaction. Avail DE operates in a leased warehouse in Chandler, Arizona. This lease was assigned in connection with the Avail Transaction.

Through ECHG and its subsidiaries, Envela plays a larger role in environmental sustainability. It is our mission to solve problems for our clients and leave the planet a better place than we found it. The world is quickly shifting its priorities to better manage our global resources, and it is our drive to work with our customers to design a flexible, convenient, hassle-free recycling solution that accommodates their specific needs.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

DGSE Buy Sell Trade 

DGSE provides a marketplace that delivers what we believe to be unparalleled value and liquidity for those seeking to buy, sell or trade luxury hard assets like jewelry, watches and diamonds, as well as most numismatic items, discussed below. DGSE buys and sells merchandise in every major jewelry category, including bridal jewelry, fashion jewelry, custom-made jewelry, diamonds and other gemstones, findings (jewelry components) and fine watches.

Much of our jewelry and fine-watch inventory is purchased directly from individual and wholesale customers at our retail locations. We process these purchased items at a central location where expert jewelers, gemologists, precious metal dealers and watchmakers sort them into three main resale categories: retail appropriate, wholesale appropriate and refiner appropriate. Following a determination of retail appropriateness, jewelry and fine watches are cleaned, serviced and repaired by our experienced jewelers and watchmakers so they’re in like-new condition and suitable for resale. Most of these items are then individually tagged and sent to one of our retail locations for sale. Items determined to be not appropriate for our retail locations but suitable for wholesale are grouped into wholesale lots and liquidated through either wholesale contacts or via in-person dealer-to-dealer sales. Items that are not appropriate for retail or wholesale are sold to a third-party refiner.

The higher-quality diamonds and gemstones that we purchase are typically submitted for independent assessment and certification by the Gemological Institute of America (“GIA”) and other third-party certifying authorities. This process helps us resell the diamonds and gemstones individually or as components of our custom bridal and fashion jewelry. Mid-quality diamonds and gemstones are often also utilized in our custom fashion jewelry or packaged with lower-quality stones and sold to wholesalers across the country. DGSE utilizes jewelry makers to design and create custom fashion jewelry for sale at its locations, including to customer specifications.

In addition to our own inventory of reconditioned luxury hard assets that we offer for sale, we maintain relationships with numerous commercial consignment vendors across the country who supply us with new and pre-owned jewelry on consignment. This supplements our over-the-counter jewelry purchases and enhances our overall jewelry offering. Sales of this consignment jewelry are settled with our consignment vendors on a weekly or monthly basis.

DGSE also buys and sells most numismatic items, including rare coins, currency, medals, tokens and other monetary collectibles. Most of our rare coins, currency and monetary collectibles are purchased directly from individual customers. We then resell them through our retail activities or wholesale contacts.

DGSE Bullion

Our bullion-trading operation buys and sells all forms of gold, silver, platinum and palladium products, including United States and other government-issue coins, private-mint medallions, art bars and trade unit bars. All of our store locations conduct retail bullion transactions. Wholesale bullion transactions are conducted through our main bullion-trading operation in Dallas, Texas, through which DGSE maintains numerous vendor relationships with major industry wholesalers, mints and institutions.

We purchase bullion products from a variety of vendors and sell them based on current precious-metal market pricing. Bullion inventory is subject to market-value changes created by underlying commodity markets. While we believe that we effectively manage commodity risk associated with our bullion business, including by periodically entering into futures contracts to hedge our exposure against market-price changes, there are national and international factors beyond our control that may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume. These factors include, but are not limited to, U.S. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, and government and private-mint supply.

DGSE Other Products & Services

We maintain a jewelry-repair center at our Dallas flagship location. Our stores accept repair, polishing and service orders through all of our locations which are routed to our Dallas flagship location for service.

CORPORATE INFORMATION

We incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 16, 1965, as Canyon State Mining Corporation of Nevada. During the ensuing 57 years, the Company transformed its business to meet its customers’ needs and changed its name to reflect this transformation, including to the following: Canyon State Corporation (October 13, 1981), The American Pacific Mint, Inc. (July 15, 1986), Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange, Inc. (June 22, 1992), and DGSE Companies, Inc. (June 26, 2001). By pursuing diversified business opportunities in the recommerce sector that has potential long-term rewards, we continued to evolve, and on December 12, 2019, we changed our name to Envela Corporation to better reflect our current business operations and diversified recommerce portfolio. These diversified business opportunities include authenticated recommerce retail of luxury hard assets; end-of-life IT asset recycling; data destruction and IT-asset disposition; and provision of products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial companies.

RELATIONSHIPS 

Envela has a corporate policy governing the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of transactions with related persons, as that term is defined in the Instructions to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, promulgated under the Securities Act (“Related Party”). Under this policy, all Related Party transactions are identified and approved prior to consummation of the transaction to ensure they are consistent with the Company’s best interests and the best interests of its stockholders. Among other factors, Envela’s board of directors (its “Board”) considers the size and duration of the transaction, the nature and interest of the Related Party in the transaction, whether the transaction may involve a conflict of interest and if the transaction is on terms that are at least as favorable to the Company as would be available in a comparable transaction with an unaffiliated third party. Envela’s Board reviews all Related Party transactions at least annually to determine if it is in the Company’s best interests and the best interests of the stockholders to continue, modify, or terminate any of the Related Party transactions. Envela’s Related Party Transaction Policy is available for review in its entirety under the “Investors” menu of the Company’s corporate relations website at envela.com.

On May 20, 2019, the Company entered into two loan agreements with John R. Loftus, the CEO and President of the Company and Chairman of the Board. The first note with a principal balance of $6,925,979, proceeds of which were used to finance an asset acquisition, was a five-year promissory note amortized over 20 years at 6% annual interest rate. The second note with a principal balance of $3,074,021, proceeds of which were used to pay off an accounts payable – related party balance to a previous Related Party as of May 20, 2019, was a five-year note amortized over 20 years at 6% annual interest rate. Both notes were being serviced by operational cash flow. On November 23, 2021, Farmers State Bank of Oakley, Kansas refinanced both of the loans from Mr. Loftus, therefore, paying-off all note payables, related party loans from Mr. Loftus. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company paid Mr. Loftus $495,490 and $580,957, respectively, in interest on the Company’s outstanding note payables, related party. 

SALES AND MARKETING

In fiscal year 2021, DGSE’s advertising activities continued to rely heavily on digital media, radio and print. Marketing activities centered on each of the major business categories, emphasizing our broad array of products, expertise, and price advantages compared to our local and regional competition. In fiscal year 2021, we spent approximately $407,000 on advertising and marketing in our operations, a 61% year-over-year increase. Our advertising and marketing spending represent costs for traditional and digital media, in-store displays, brochures and informational pamphlets, production fees, and other related items.

In fiscal year 2022, we anticipate our radio, digital and social media presence to remain an integral part of DGSE’s marketing strategy. The website for the Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange has been redesigned to be viewed on a variety of platforms across a multitude of digital devices. We believe our enhanced web platform also facilitates a personalized shopping experience, including recommending inventory, and delivers a seamless digital experience for product research and social sharing. Additionally, we anticipate that social media will continue to play an increasingly larger role in our overall advertising mix. Digital advertising will continue to allow us to target specific customer groups on a wider scale.

ECHG’s advertising activities focus primarily on regional and national trade shows. In fiscal year 2021, we spent approximately $53,000 on advertising and marketing, a significant portion of which was spent at regional and national trade shows. In 2022, ECHG expects trade shows will continue to be the largest portion of their advertising budget since downstream recyclers frequent such trade shows to evaluate who can meet their needs or service their projects. Also, at trade shows, representatives of ITAD USA make many contacts with decision makers seeking either to purchase refurbished electronics for their employees or to sell their older electronic devices for recycling and reuse. 

SEASONALITY

DGSE’s retail and wholesale jewelry business is generally seasonal. The time periods around Christmas, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day are typically the main seasons for jewelry sales.

DGSE’s business of buying and selling bullion, precious metal, and rare-coins are less seasonal, though we believe they are directly impacted by several factors outside of our control, including U.S. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, governmental and private-mint supply. These factors may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume.

PART I
Item 1

Seasonal swings are rarely sustained or noticed in ECHG’s business of recycling end-of-life assets and refurbishing value-sustaining electronic components. 

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2021, we employed 256 people, all full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our current employee relations are in good condition. Our management policy is to keep employees informed of material decisions that affect them, encourage employee suggestions, and implement them whenever practicable.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Envela buys and resells precious metals, which are generally subject to regulation including conflict mineral tracing. However, in conjunction with legal counsel, we have determined that we do not have sufficient control over manufacturing of any of our products to be included in the group of companies required to provide conflict-minerals disclosure and reporting. If our sourcing processes should change, or if there is a determination that our current practices should be covered by the conflict-minerals reporting and disclosure guidelines, we would need to implement significant additional measures to comply with these rules. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The conflict-mineral diligence process, the results from that process and the related reporting obligations could increase costs, adversely affect our reputation and adversely affect our ability to obtain merchandise” for more information. In addition, Envela partners with refiners for portion of its sales. These refiners are subject to increasingly stringent governmental regulation in their refining operations, and a change or increase in such regulations in the United States or abroad may have an adverse impact on our business.

Envela recognizes that climate change is a major risk to society and therefore continues to take steps to reduce its climatic impact. Nevertheless, management believes that climate change has only a limited influence on Envela’s performance and is of limited significance directly to the business. However, as a significant portion of Envela’s business relies on the availability of disposable income for its customers, a change in fuel prices could have a material impact on Envela’s business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Adverse economic conditions in the U.S. or in other key markets, and the resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results” for more information.

Envela applied for and received, on April 20, 2020, an approximately $1.67 million federally backed loan with 1% interest, the proceeds of which were intended to pay employees and cover certain rent and utility-related costs during the COVID-19 pandemic (the “Federal Loan”). The Federal Loan was forgivable to the extent that certain criteria were met. We applied for the forgiveness of the Federal Loan during Fiscal 2020, and received notification during Fiscal 2021 that the loan had been forgiven. The forgiveness of the Federal Loan is included in Other income from loan forgiveness on our consolidated income statements.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

Envela files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such information, and amendments to reports previously filed or furnished, is available free of charge from our corporate website, envela.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains an internet site at sec.gov that contains the Company’s filings.
