This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industrys actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

General Overview

We are a development stage company that has not realized any revenues to date. On August 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement with New Benefits, Inc. to become a reseller of telemedical packages. As a reseller we intended to offer membership to healthcare benefits packages for New Benefits, Inc. under its own private label. We are no longer in this business. 

On November 24th, 2017, we appointed Jiang Yu as President in an effort to bring a bitcoin based concept into the company involved in Blockchain Technology, Cryptocurrency, Payment Solutions, Data Intelligence. Eventually this merger did not move forward and Jiang Ju resigned and was replaced by the previous President, J. Jacob Isaacs, on January 11, 2018. Jiang Yu briefly held a control position in the company of 78,750,000 shares and in January of 2018 returned them to the former President, J. Jacob Isaacs. We therefore remain a shell company seeking a merger as of this 10K filing.
