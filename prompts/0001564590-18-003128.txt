ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (“AWI” or the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891.  When we refer to “we,” “our” and “us” in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries.
 We are a global leader in the design, innovation and manufacture of commercial and residential ceiling, wall and suspension system solutions. We design, manufacture and sell ceiling systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool and metal) throughout the Americas.
 On November 17, 2017, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Knauf International GmbH (“Knauf”), to sell certain subsidiaries comprising our business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (“EMEA”) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by Worthington Armstrong Venture (“WAVE”), our joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc., in which AWI holds a 50% interest. The consideration to be paid by Knauf in connection with the sale is $330.0 million in cash, inclusive of amounts due to WAVE, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on the economic impact of any required regulatory remedies and a working capital adjustment.  The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, is currently anticipated to close in mid-2018. Our EMEA and Pacific Rim segment’s historical financial results have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  
 On January 13, 2017, we acquired the business and assets of Tectum, Inc. (“Tectum”), based in Newark, Ohio.  Tectum is a manufacturer of acoustical ceiling, wall and structural solutions for commercial building applications with two manufacturing facilities. Tectum’s operations from the date of acquisition, and its assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017, have been included as a component of our Architectural Specialties segment.  
 On April 1, 2016, we completed our separation of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (“AFI”).  AFI’s historical financial results have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  
 See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisition and discontinued operations.
 We are focused on driving sustainable shareholder value creation. Our strategic priority is to accelerate profitable sales and earnings growth.  Our goal is to expand into new markets and grow in existing markets in the Americas by selling a broader array of products and solutions into those markets.  
 Reportable Segments
 Effective December 31, 2017 and in connection with the announced sale of our EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses, our historical EMEA and Pacific Rim segments have been excluded from our results of continuing operations.  As a result, effective December 31, 2017 and for all periods presented, our operating segments are as follows:  Mineral Fiber, Architectural Specialties and Unallocated Corporate.  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information.
Markets
 We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The major markets in which we compete are:
 Commercial.  Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings.  Renovation work is estimated to represent the majority of the commercial market opportunity.  Most of our revenue comes from the following sectors of commercial building – office, education, transportation, healthcare and retail.  We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity.  Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 18 to 24 months.  We also monitor office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, state and local government spending, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities.  We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction.  Additionally, we believe that customer preferences for product type, style, color, availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue.

In our Mineral Fiber segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial market sales are used for renovation purposes by end-users of our products.  The end-use of our products is based on management estimates as such information is not easily determinable.  
 Residential.  We also sell mineral fiber products for use in single and multi-family housing.  These products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall.  We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products.  We estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement / remodel) work represents the majority of the residential market opportunity.  Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence.  
 Approximately 75% of our consolidated net sales are to distributors.  Sales to large home centers account for slightly less than 10% of our consolidated sales.  Our remaining sales are to contractors and retailers.  
 Geographic Areas
 See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information by geographic areas.
Customers
 We use our reputation, capabilities, service and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers.  We principally sell commercial products to building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors’ alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. We have important relationships with national home centers such as Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc., as well as wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers. 
 Net sales to three commercial distributors totaling $426.1 million, included within our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments, individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2017.  
 Working Capital
 We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers.  Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements.  We sell our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future.  These practices are typical within the industry.  
Competition
 We face strong competition in all of our businesses.  Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price.  Competition comes from both domestic and international manufacturers.  Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions, namely, drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum).  Excess industry capacity exists for certain products, which tends to increase price competition.  The following companies are our primary competitors:
 CertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by ROCKWOOL International A/S), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rockfon A/S (owned by ROCKWOOL International A/S), USG Corporation, Ceilings Plus (owned by USG Corporation), Rulon International, and 9Wood.
 Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business.  The principal raw materials include: fiberglass, perlite, starch, waste paper, pigments and clays.  We manufacture most of the production needs for mineral wool at one of our manufacturing facilities.  Finally, we use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings by us and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures ceiling grid.
 We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas and water.
 In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our operations.  However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same 
 5


materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers.  There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us.
 Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically.  Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs.  Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers.
 Sourced Products
 Some of the products that we sell are sourced from third parties.  Our primary sourced products include specialty ceiling products.  We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from the Pacific Rim and Europe.  Sales of sourced products represented approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenue in 2017.
 In general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products.  However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate.
 Seasonality
 Generally, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction.  
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
 Patent protection is important to our business.  Our competitive position has been enhanced by patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses.  In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
 Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.  The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies.  Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not believe we are materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
 Certain of our trademarks, including without limitation,  , Armstrong®, Calla®, Cirrus®, Cortega®, Dune™, Humiguard®, Infusions®, Lyra®, MetalWorks™,  Optima®, Perla™, Soundscapes®, Sustain®, Tectum®, Total Acoustics®,  Ultima®, and WoodWorks®, are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition.  Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
 In connection with the separation and distribution of AFI, we entered into several agreements with AFI that, together with a plan of division, provided for the separation and allocation of assets between AWI and AFI.  These agreements include a Trademark License Agreement and a Transition Trademark License Agreement.  Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, AWI provided AFI with a perpetual, royalty-free license to utilize the “Armstrong” trade name and logo.  Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement, AFI provided us with a five-year royalty-free license to utilize the “Inspiring Great Spaces” tagline, logo and related color scheme.
 Pursuant to our Purchase Agreement with Knauf related to the sale of our EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses and prior to the closing, AWI anticipates entering into an agreement with Knauf relating to the use of certain intellectual property by Knauf after the closing, including the Armstrong trade name. 
 We review the carrying value of trademarks annually for potential impairment.  See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,900 full-time and part-time employees worldwide compared to approximately 3,700 as of December 31, 2016.  The increase in total worldwide employees as of December 31, 2017 in comparison to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to our addition of Tectum employees, partially offset by a reduction of employees related to the closure of one 
 6


of our plants in China.  Excluding our EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses, we had approximately 2,200 employees as of December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 2,000 as of December 31, 2016.  
 As of December 31, 2017, approximately 75% of our 1,100 production employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions.  Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 460 employees at two U.S. plants will expire during 2018.  Outside the U.S., most of our production employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or state-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms.  We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
 Research & Development
 Research and development (“R&D”) activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products’ competitiveness.  Principal R&D functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes.  We incurred $17.4 million in 2017, $17.8 million in 2016 and $18.7 million in 2015 of R&D expenses. 
Sustainability and Environmental Matters
 The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability.
 We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.  We are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations.
 Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
 Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and state Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing existing or potential environmental contamination at several domestically owned, formerly owned and non-owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity.  In a few cases, we are one of several potentially responsible parties and have agreed to jointly fund required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability.  We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  
 Most of our facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment.  We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations.
 On September 8, 2017, Roxul USA, Inc. (d/b/a Rockfon) filed litigation against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging anticompetitive conduct seeking remedial measures and unspecified damages.  Roxul USA, Inc. is a significant ceilings systems competitor with global headquarters in Europe and expanding operations in the Americas.  We believe the allegations are without merit and are vigorously defending the matter. 
 We are involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. From time to time, for example, we may be a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under various allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace; or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants.  Such allegations may involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe that any current claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. For these matters, we also may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands.  While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we 
 7


do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 Liabilities of $13.5 million and $4.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, were recorded for environmental liabilities that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made.  See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
