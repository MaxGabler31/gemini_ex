Item 1. Business
We are a geographically diversified homebuilder with active operations in 13 states within three geographic regions in the United States: the West, East, and Southeast. Our homes are designed to appeal to homeowners at different price points across various demographic segments, and are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction. Our objective is to provide our customers with homes that incorporate exceptional value and quality, at affordable prices, while seeking to maximize our return on invested capital over the course of a housing cycle.
Beazer Homes USA, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Abernathy Road, Suite 260, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, and our main telephone number is (770) 829-3700. We also provide information about our company, including active communities, through our Internet website located at www.beazer.com. Information on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference. 
Industry Overview and Current Market Conditions
The sale and production of new homes has been, and will likely remain, a large industry in the United States for four primary reasons: (1) historical growth in both population and households; (2) demographic patterns that indicate an increased likelihood of home ownership as age and income increase; (3) job creation within geographic markets that necessitate new home construction; and (4) consumer demand for home features that can be more easily provided in a new home than an existing home.
The demand for new and existing homes is dependent on a variety of demographic and economic factors, including job and wage growth, household formation, consumer confidence and mortgage financing. Currently, we are experiencing a strong job market as wages rise and the rate of household formation continues to grow. However, as the prices for new and existing homes have increased over the past few years and mortgage interest rates have inched upward, the affordability of homes has recently come under pressure, causing a slowdown in sales activity. In addition, labor availability concerns have helped constrain the growth of the supply of new homes available for sale. Though affordability concerns will continue, we believe the strong economic backdrop along with the limited supply of homes for sale provides us with confidence in the overall market for new home sales over the near term.
Long-Term Business Strategy
We achieved both our “2B-10” plan and our $250.0 million debt reduction goal in fiscal 2018. Collectively, these multi-year initiatives were part of our larger and longer-term Balanced Growth strategy. We remain committed to this Balanced Growth strategy, which is designed to increase shareholder value by improving our return on assets while reducing operational risk and debt.
For fiscal 2019, we have several objectives that are aligned with this longer-term strategy. These include generating higher profitability, increasing return on total assets, and further reducing our net debt to EBITDA ratio.
To drive additional profitability, we expect to have a higher community count and an increase in our average selling price (ASP) in fiscal 2019, primarily driven by a mix shift between communities and divisions. We will still maintain one of the lowest ASPs among our peer group.
To improve our return on assets, we expect to benefit from the activation of a number of assets that were previously classified as land held for future development, increase the portion of our land position that is controlled by lot options, and target smaller communities for acquisition.
To reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio, we expect to increase profitability and modestly reduce our outstanding debt by the end of the fiscal year.

Seasonal and Quarterly Variability
Our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters, and increased closings in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. However, these seasonal patterns may be impacted or reduced by a variety of factors, including periods of economic downturn, which result in decreased revenues and closings. 
Markets and Product Description
We evaluate a number of factors in determining which geographic markets to enter and remain in as well as which consumer segments to target with our homebuilding activities. We compete in sixteen geographic markets across the United States in part to reduce our exposure to any particular regional economy. Within these markets, we build homes in a variety of new home communities. We continually review our sixteen markets based on aggregate demographic information, land prices and availability, competitive dynamics, and our own operating results. We use the results of these reviews to re-allocate our investments to those markets where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital.
We generally seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition in a particular market with respect to customer service, product type, incorporating energy-efficient features into the homes we build and design, and construction quality. We maintain the flexibility to alter our product mix within a given market, depending on market conditions. In determining our product mix, we consider demographic trends, demand for a particular type of product, consumer preferences, margins, timing, and the economic strength of the market. Depending on the market, we attempt to address one or more of the following categories of home buyers: entry-level, move-up, or retirement-oriented. We expect our focus on retirement-oriented buyers to increase as our Gatherings® business progresses, which is further discussed below. Within these buyer groups, we have developed detailed targeted buyer profiles based on demographic and psychographic data, including information about their marital and family status, employment, age, affluence, special interests, media consumption, and distance moved. Although we offer a selection of amenities and home customization options, we generally do not build “custom homes.” In all of our home offerings, we attempt to maximize customer satisfaction by incorporating quality and energy-efficient materials, distinctive design features, convenient locations, and competitive prices.
Gatherings. Gatherings® by Beazer Homes was officially launched in 2016 to address the growing 55 plus segment and to capitalize on Beazer’s success in building age-targeted condominiums. We strive to provide exceptional value at an affordable price and become a premier provider of condominium living for active adults over age 55. We are currently pursuing Gatherings assets in Florida, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Arizona, California, North Carolina, and South Carolina. As of September 30, 2018, we have approved new communities representing nearly 700 future sales.
Operational Overview
Corporate Operations
We perform the following functions at our corporate office to promote standardization and operational excellence:
•evaluate and select geographic markets;
•allocate capital resources for land acquisitions;
•maintain and develop relationships with lenders and capital markets to create and maintain access to financial resources;
•maintain and develop relationships with national product vendors;
•perform certain accounting, finance, legal, risk and marketing functions to support our field operations; 
•operate and manage information systems and technology support operations; and
•monitor the operations of our divisions and partners. 
We allocate capital resources in a manner consistent with our overall business strategy. We will vary our capital allocation based on market conditions, results of operations, and other factors. Capital commitments are determined through consultation among selected executive and operational personnel who play an important role in ensuring that new investments are consistent with our strategy. Financial controls are also maintained through the centralization and standardization of accounting and finance activities, policies, and procedures.
4

Field Operations
The development and construction of each new home community is managed by our operating divisions, each of which is led by a regional market leader who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. Within our operating divisions, our field teams are equipped with the skills needed to complete the functions of identifying land acquisition opportunities, land entitlement, land development, home construction, local marketing, sales, warranty service, and certain purchasing and planning/design functions. However, the accounting and accounts payable functions of our field operations are concentrated in our national accounting center, which we consider to be part of our corporate operations.
Land Acquisition and Development
Generally, the land we acquire is purchased only after necessary entitlements have been obtained so that we have the right to begin development or construction as market conditions dictate. The term “entitlements” refers to subdivision approvals, development agreements, tentative maps, or recorded plats, depending on the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Entitlements generally give a developer the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with conditions that are usually within the developer's control. Although entitlements are ordinarily obtained prior to the purchase of land, we are still required to obtain a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process. In limited circumstances, we will purchase property without all necessary entitlements where we have identified an opportunity to build on such property in a manner consistent with our strategy.
We select land for purchase based upon a variety of factors, including:

• | internal and external demographic and marketing studies;


• | suitability for development during the time period of one to five years from the beginning of the development process to the last closing; 


• | financial review as to the feasibility of the proposed project, including profit margins and returns on capital employed;


• | the ability to secure governmental approvals and entitlements;


• | environmental and legal due diligence;


• | competition in the area;


• | proximity to local traffic corridors and amenities; and


• | management's judgment of the real estate market and economic trends and our experience in a particular market.

We generally purchase land or obtain an option to purchase land, which, in either case, requires certain site improvements prior to home construction. Where required, we then undertake or the grantor of the option then undertakes in the case of land under option, the development activities (through contractual arrangements with local developers, general contractors, and/or subcontractors), which include site planning and engineering as well as constructing roads, water, sewer, and utility infrastructures, drainage and recreational facilities, and other amenities. When available in certain markets, we also buy finished lots that are ready for home construction. During our fiscal 2018 and 2017, we continued to pursue land acquisition opportunities and develop our land positions, spending approximately $425.4 million and $301.4 million, respectively, for land acquisition and $210.1 million and $145.0 million, respectively, for land development. 
We strive to develop a design and marketing concept for each of our communities, which includes determination of the size, style, and price range of the homes, layout of streets and individual lots, and overall community design. The product line offered in a particular new home community depends upon many factors, including the housing generally available in the area, the needs of a particular market, and our cost of lots in the new home community. 
Option Contracts
We acquire certain lots by means of option contracts from various sellers and developers, including land banking entities. Option contracts generally require the payment of a cash deposit or issuance of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a fixed or variable price.
5

Under option contracts, purchase of the underlying properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers. Our liability under option contracts is generally limited to forfeiture of the non-refundable deposits, letters of credit, and other non-refundable amounts incurred, which totaled approximately $72.8 million as of September 30, 2018. The total remaining purchase price, net of cash deposits, committed under all land option contracts was $383.2 million as of September 30, 2018.
We expect to exercise, subject to market conditions and seller satisfaction of contract terms, most of our option contracts. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as market conditions, weather conditions, and the timing of the completion of development activities, will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether lot options will be exercised at all.
The following table summarizes land controlled by us by reportable segment as of September 30, 2018:

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
Occasionally, we use legal entities in which we have less than a controlling interest. We enter into the majority of these investments with land developers, other homebuilders and financial partners to acquire attractive land positions, to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. The underlying land positions are developed into finished lots for sale to the unconsolidated entity’s members or other third parties. We account for our interest in unconsolidated entities under the equity method.
Historically, we and our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations of our unconsolidated entities. As of September 30, 2018, our unconsolidated entities had borrowings outstanding totaling $12.3 million. See Note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information.
Our consolidated balance sheets include investments in unconsolidated entities totaling $4.0 million and $4.0 million as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
Construction
We typically act as the general contractor for the construction of our new home communities. Our project development activities are controlled by our operating divisions whose employees supervise the construction of each new home community by coordinating the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, subjecting their work to quality and cost controls and ensuring compliance with zoning and building codes. We specify that quality, durable materials be used in the construction of our homes. Our subcontractors follow design plans prepared by architects and engineers who are retained or directly employed by us and whose designs are geared to the local market. Our home plans are created in a collaborative effort with industry leading architectural firms, allowing us to stay current in our home designs with changing trends as well as expanding our focus on value engineering without sacrificing design value for our customers.
Agreements with our subcontractors and materials suppliers are generally entered into after a competitive bidding process during which we obtain information from prospective subcontractors and vendors with respect to their financial condition and ability to perform their agreements with us in accordance with the specifications we provide. Subcontractors typically are retained on a project-by-project basis to complete construction at a fixed price. We do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for materials being utilized for homes under construction. We have numerous suppliers of raw materials and services used in our business, and such materials and services have been and continue to be available. However, material prices may fluctuate due to various factors, including demand or supply shortages and the price of certain commodities, which may be beyond the control of us or our vendors. Whenever possible, we enter into regional and national supply contracts with certain of our vendors. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers and subcontractors are good.
Construction time for our homes depends on local governmental approval processes, product type, location, and the availability of labor, materials, and supplies. Homes are designed to promote efficient use of space and materials and to minimize construction costs and time. In all of our markets, construction of a home is typically completed within three to six months following commencement of construction. As of September 30, 2018, excluding models, we had 1,973 homes at various stages of completion, of which 1,246 were under contract and included in backlog at such date and 727 homes (240 were substantially completed and 487 under construction) were not under a sales contract, either because the construction of the home was begun without a sales contract or because the original sales contract had been canceled (known as “speculative” or “spec” homes).

Warranty Program
We currently provide a limited warranty (ranging from one to two years) covering workmanship and materials per our defined standards of performance. In addition, we provide a limited warranty for up to ten years covering only certain defined structural element failures. For certain homes sold through March 31, 2004 (and in certain markets through July 31, 2004), we self-insured our warranty obligations through our wholly-owned risk retention group. We continue to maintain reserves to cover potential claims on homes covered under this warranty program. Beginning with homes sold on or after April 1, 2004 (August 1, 2004 in certain markets), our warranties have been issued, administered and insured, subject to applicable self-insured retentions, by independent third parties.
Since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors whose contracts generally include an indemnity obligation and a requirement that certain minimum insurance requirements be met, including providing us with a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, many claims relating to workmanship and materials are the primary responsibility of our subcontractors.
In addition, we maintain third-party insurance, subject to applicable self-insured retentions, for most construction defects that we encounter in the normal course of business. We believe that our warranty and litigation accruals and third-party insurance are adequate to cover the ultimate resolution of our potential liabilities associated with known and anticipated warranty and construction defect related claims and litigation. Please see Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information. However, there can be no assurance that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be effective against claims made by homebuyers; that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates; that we will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence, or building related claims; or that claims will not arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and/or not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors.
Marketing and Sales
We make extensive use of digital and traditional marketing vehicles and other promotional activities, including our websites (www.beazer.com and www.beazerenespanol.com), mobile site (m.beazer.com), real estate listing sites, digital advertising (including search engine marketing and display advertising), social media, video, brochures, direct marketing, and out-of-home advertising (including billboards and signage) located in the immediate areas of our developments, as well as additional activities. In connection with these marketing vehicles, we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks and internet domain names, including Beazer Homes®, Gatherings®, and Choice PlansTM, for use in our business.
Our practice is to build, decorate, furnish, and landscape model homes for each community we build and maintain on-site sales offices. As of September 30, 2018, we maintained and owned 238 model homes. We believe that model homes play a particularly important role in our selling efforts, and we are continuously innovating within our model homes to provide a unique, memorable, and hands-on experience for our customers, i.e., digital kiosks, interactive site maps/plans, interactive magnetic floor plan boards, signage, and more. The selection of interior features is also a principal component of our marketing and sales efforts. 
Our homes are customarily sold through commissioned new home sales counselors (who work from the sales offices located in the model homes used in the community) as well as through independent brokers. Our new home counselors are available to assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans, price information, tours of model homes, the community's unique selling proposition, detailed explanations of our three differentiators, discussed below, and associated savings opportunities. Sales personnel are trained internally and participate in a structured training program focused on sales techniques, product enhancements, competitive products in the area, construction schedules, and Company policies around compliance, which management believes results in a sales force with extensive knowledge of our operating policies and housing products. Our policy is that sales personnel must be licensed real estate agents where required by law.
We sometimes use various sales incentives in order to attract homebuyers. The use of incentives depends largely on local economic and competitive market conditions. 
Depending on market conditions, we also at times begin construction on a number of homes for which no signed sales contract exists, known as “speculative” or “spec” homes. This speculative inventory satisfies demand by providing near ready or move in ready homes targeted at relocated personnel and others who require a completed home within 60 days.
Differentiating Beazer Homes
We know that our buyers have many choices when purchasing a home. To help us become a builder of choice and thereby achieve the operational objectives we have outlined, we have identified the following three strategic pillars that differentiate Beazer's homes from both resale homes and other newly built homes:
8

Mortgage Choices - Most of our buyers need to arrange financing in order to purchase a new home. Unlike many of our major competitors, we do not have an in-house mortgage company. Instead, for every Beazer community, we have identified a group of preferred lenders that provide a comprehensive product portfolio, competitive rates and fees, and outstanding customer service. We encourage those lenders to compete for our customers’ business, which is a unique program among national homebuilders and enables our customers to secure the mortgage program that best fits their needs.
Choice PlansTM - Every family lives in their home differently, which is why we created Choice PlansTM. Choice PlansTM allow buyers to choose how primary living areas, like the kitchen and master bathroom, are configured at no extra cost. Whether our buyers choose an office or an expanded family room, our plans are designed for the way a buyer wants to live.
Energy Efficiency - Nearly all newly-built homes afford buyers a substantial reduction in utility bills due to their modern, energy-efficient construction and materials. That's a feature most used homes cannot provide. At Beazer, we go even further by ensuring our homes are built to the latest ENERGY STAR® standards and by providing every buyer with an energy rating for their home, completed by a qualified third-party rating company. Used homes typically have an energy rating (on a scale in which a lower score is better) of 130, while new homes that are built to code typically score around 100. The average new Beazer home has an energy rating of 62.
Customer Financing
As previously mentioned, we do not provide mortgage origination services. Unlike many of our peers, we have no ownership interest in any lender and are able to promote competition among lenders on behalf of our customers through our Mortgage Choices program. Approximately 91% of our fiscal 2018 customers elected to finance a portion of their home purchase.
Competition
The development and sale of residential properties is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality, and price with numerous large and small homebuilders, including many homebuilders with nationwide operations and greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us. We also compete for residential sales with individual resales of existing homes and available rental housing. 
We utilize our experience within our geographic markets and the breadth of our product line to vary regional product offerings to reflect changing market conditions. We strive to respond to market conditions and to capitalize on the opportunities for advantageous land acquisitions in desirable locations. Our product offerings strive to provide extraordinary value at an affordable price with intentional focus on Millennials and Baby Boomers.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
In most instances, our land is purchased with entitlements, giving us the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with specified conditions, which generally are within our control. The length of time necessary to obtain such permits and approvals affects the carrying costs of unimproved property acquired for the purpose of development and construction. In addition, the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretation and application. Many governmental authorities have imposed impact fees as a means of defraying the cost of providing certain governmental services to developing areas. To date, these governmental approval processes have not had a material adverse effect on our development activities, and all homebuilders in a given market face the same fees and restrictions. However, there can be no assurance that these and other restrictions will not adversely affect us in the future.
We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums, “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives, or building permit allocation ordinances, which could be implemented in the future in the markets in which we operate. Substantially all of our land is entitled and, therefore, the moratoriums generally would only adversely affect us if they arose from health, safety, and welfare issues such as insufficient water or sewage facilities. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for communities in their jurisdictions. However, these fees are normally established when we receive recorded final maps and building permits. We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. These laws may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Our communities in California are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws, particularly surrounding water usage due to continuing drought conditions within that region.
In order to provide homes to homebuyers qualifying for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured or Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct homes in compliance with FHA and VA regulations. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding operating procedures, investments, lending, and privacy disclosures and premiums.
9

In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. Also, in various states, our new home counselors are required to be licensed real estate agents and to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to real estate agents.
Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, where applicable, could result in loss of licensing and a restriction of our business activities in the applicable jurisdiction.
Health and Safety Matters
We strive to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. We believe that corporate social responsibility is an essential factor for our overall success. This includes adopting ethical practices to direct how we do business while keeping the interests of our stakeholders and the environment in mind, including valuing and challenging the talented men and women who comprise our workforce.
The objectives of our practices and policies underscore this commitment:

• | To treat all employees with dignity and respect. Employee diversity and inclusion are embraced and opportunities for training, growth, and advancement are strongly encouraged.

Bonds and Other Obligations
In connection with the development of our communities, we are frequently required to provide performance, maintenance, and other bonds and letters of credit in support of our related obligations with respect to such developments. The amount of such obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our pending development activities. In the event any such bonds or letters of credit are drawn upon, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of such bonds or letters of credit. As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately $237.8 million and $38.1 million of outstanding performance bonds and letters of credit, respectively, primarily related to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments. 
Employees and Subcontractors
As of September 30, 2018, we employed approximately 1,280 persons, of whom 393 were sales and marketing personnel and 316 were construction personnel. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, at times certain of the subcontractors engaged by us may be represented by labor unions or may be subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.
