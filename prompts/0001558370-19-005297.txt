 Overview
 Virtusa Corporation (the “Company”, “Virtusa”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global provider of digital engineering and information technology (“IT”) outsourcing services that accelerate business outcomes for our clients. We support Forbes Global 2000 clients across large, consumer facing industries like banking, financial services, insurance, healthcare, communications, technology, and media and entertainment, as these clients seek to improve their business performance through accelerating revenue growth, delivering compelling consumer experiences, improving operational efficiencies, and lowering overall IT costs. We provide services across the entire spectrum of the IT services lifecycle, from consulting, to technology and user experience (“UX”) design, development of IT applications, systems integration, testing and business assurance, and maintenance and support services, including infrastructure and managed services. We help our clients solve critical business problems by leveraging a combination of our distinctive consulting approach, unique platforming methodology, and deep domain and technology expertise.
 Our services enable our clients to accelerate business outcomes by consolidating, rationalizing and modernizing their core customer‑facing processes into one or more core systems. We deliver cost‑effective solutions through a global delivery model, applying advanced methods such as Agile, an industry standard technique designed to accelerate application development. We also use our consulting methodology, which we refer to as Accelerated Solution Design (“ASD”), which is a collaborative decision‑making and design process performed with the client to ensure our solutions meet the client’s specifications and requirements. Our industry leading business transformational solutions combine deep domain expertise with our strengths in software engineering and business consulting to support our clients’ business imperative initiatives across business growth and IT operations.
 Headquartered in Massachusetts, we have offices in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Qatar, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, with global delivery centers in India, Sri Lanka, Hungary, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as multiple near shore delivery centers in the United States.

 We support the chief executive officers (“CXOs”) at our client organizations, including the chief information officers (“CIOs”), chief technology officers (“CTOs”), chief operating officers (“COOs”), and chief digital/ marketing officers (“CDOs/ CMOs”) in solving their most critical issues, including reducing total cost of ownership, accelerating time‑to‑market, increasing productivity, improving innovation velocity, expanding into adjacent markets and/or new revenue segments, and enhancing the customer experience delivered by their organizations.  Our digital engineering services (“DES”) support our clients’ business growth imperative by delivering targeted and differentiated solutions that help our clients expand their addressable markets, as well as develop go‑to‑market strategies supporting new revenue streams. To improve IT efficiencies and reduce the cost of IT operations, we use our operational excellence services (“OES”) to help our clients consolidate applications into platforms, rationalize IT infrastructure, and deliver transformational, industry‑focused solutions, thereby enabling our clients to deliver modern, efficient and agile enterprise application platforms. Our deep expertise in core technology services allows us to help our clients to lower total cost of ownership of their overall IT investments. We also combine industry specialization with our core services to deliver high‑impact solutions in critical business functions that help our clients transform their business performance and gain competitive advantage in the markets in which they operate. 
 The convergence of technology innovation, changing consumer expectations, supply chain expansion, and emergence of disruptive start‑ups, is fundamentally changing the way businesses operate. We operate in markets and industries where the combination of a growing millennial population and rapid advances in key technologies, like mobility, big data analytics, social media and cloud computing, are providing disruptive opportunities for progressive business leaders to break down barriers and expand market‑share. We enable our clients to leverage technology innovations to provide the distinctive customer experiences demanded by digital consumers who are increasingly looking for services that are available 24×7 without interruption, location aware and highly customized to their social likes and dislikes. We help our clients understand business threats and opportunities in their industries and develop strategies to help mitigate these threats and capitalize on the emerging opportunities, while preparing the business to digitally transform and position itself better in the emerging digital business environment. As part of our DES solutions, we provide end‑to‑end consulting, user experience design, technology selection, and implementation and support services, which allow our clients to understand emerging consumer demand in their markets of operation and develop, and execute to, a roadmap to transform their business and enhance their competitive differentiators. Commoditization of IT services and the emergence of software-as‑a‑service models are putting tremendous pressure on our clients’ IT organizations to improve the way they manage IT operations and lower the overall cost of IT. Our OES solutions enable our clients to improve operational and IT efficiencies through the innovative use of automation, effort compression and IT simplification.
 New advances in areas like the internet of things (“IoT”), artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”), and robotics process automation (“RPA”) are now pushing the boundaries of how technology can disrupt traditional business models and deliver significant value in several areas, including delivering new products and services, enhancing consumer experience, and improving operational efficiencies of the business. We have invested in developing deep capabilities in these new areas, fostering a strong partner ecosystem and building a rich platform for nurturing innovation and rapidly constructing prototypes that use IoT, AI and/or RPA to solve specific business problems for our clients. We have created innovation centers focused on certain technologies like IoT, AI, and ML, which offer a robust ecosystem for clients to participate and innovate in creating new solutions to their business challenges. Through these innovation centers, we have been able to deliver award winning solutions to some of our marquee clients in healthcare, communications and insurance sectors.
 Virtusa’s xLabs is focused on tapping into the disruptive startup ecosystem and the innovative, cutting‑edge technologies driving these businesses. Our xLabs, which began as a banking and financial services focused FinTech Lab, has expanded its scope to focus on delivering digital innovation for our clients across banking and financial services, insurance, healthcare, media and telecommunications industries.

 We apply our innovative platforming approach across all of our services. Through our platforming approach, we help our clients combine common business processes and rules, technology frameworks and data into reusable application platforms that can be leveraged across the enterprise to build, maintain and enhance existing and future applications. Our platforming approach enables our clients to continually improve their software platforms and applications in response to changing business needs and evolving technologies, while also allowing them to improve business agility, realize long‑term and ongoing cost savings and improve their ROI. Our platforming methodology also reduces the effort and cost required to develop and maintain IT applications by streamlining and consolidating our clients’ applications on an ongoing basis. We believe that our solutions provide our clients with the consultative and high‑value services associated with large consulting and systems integration firms, the cost‑effectiveness associated with offshore IT outsourcing firms, and the ongoing benefits of our innovative platforming approach.
 We deliver our services using our enhanced global delivery model which leverages a highly efficient onsite‑to‑offshore service delivery mix and proprietary tools and processes to manage and accelerate delivery, foster innovation, and promote continual improvement of outcomes delivered to our clients. Our global service delivery teams work seamlessly at our client locations and at our global delivery centers to provide value‑added services rapidly and cost‑effectively. Our teams do this by using our enhanced global delivery model, which we manage to a targeted 30% to 70% onsite‑to‑offshore service delivery mix, although such delivery mix may be impacted by several factors, including our new and existing client delivery requirements.
 We provide our IT services primarily to enterprises engaged in the following industries: communications and technology (“C&T”); banking, financial services and insurance (“BFSI”); and media and information (“M&I”). Our current clients include leading global enterprises such as Citi, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMC”) and British Telecommunications plc (“BT”), and leading enterprise software developers. We have a high level of repeat business among our clients. For instance, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, 91% of our revenue came from clients to whom we had been providing services for at least one year. Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 55%, 50%, 45% of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our largest client for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Citi, accounted for 18% of our total revenue with no other client accounting for 10% or more of our revenues. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, Citi accounted for 19% and 17%, respectively.
 To strengthen our digital engineering capabilities and establish a solid base in Silicon Valley, on March 12, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of eTouch Systems Corp (“eTouch US”), and its Indian subsidiary, eTouch Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd (“eTouch India,” together with eTouch US, “eTouch”) for approximately $140.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. We agreed to pay the purchase price in three tranches, with $80.0 million paid at closing, $42.5 million on the 12‑month anniversary of the close of the transaction, and $17.5 million on the 18‑month anniversary of the close of the transaction, subject in each case to certain adjustments. As part of the acquisition, we set aside up to an additional $15.0 million for retention bonuses to be paid to eTouch management and key employees in equal installments on the first and second anniversary of the transaction.
 On March 3, 2016, our Indian subsidiary, Virtusa Consulting Services Private Limited (“Virtusa India”), acquired approximately 51.7% of the fully diluted shares of Polaris Consulting & Services Limited (“Polaris”) for approximately $168.3 million in cash (the “Polaris Transaction”) pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated as of November 5, 2015, by and among Virtusa India, Polaris and the promoter sellers named therein. Through a series of transactions and in compliance with the applicable Indian rules on takeovers and SEBI Delisting Regulations, Virtusa increased its ownership interest in Polaris from 51.7% to 93.0% by February 12, 2018, when Virtusa consummated its Polaris delisting offer with respect to the public shareholders of Polaris. The delisting offer resulted in an accepted exit price of INR 480 per share (“Exit Price”), for an aggregate consideration of approximately $145.0 million, exclusive of transaction and closing costs. On July 11, 2018, the stock exchanges on which Polaris common shares are listed notified Polaris that trading in equity shares of Polaris would be discontinued and delisted effective on August 1, 2018. For a period of one year following the date of delisting, Virtusa India will, in compliance with SEBI Delisting Regulations, permit the public shareholders of Polaris to tender their shares for sale to Virtusa India at the Exit Price. In connection with the Polaris delisting offer, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Virtusa India purchased 4,669,716 shares, or 4.5%, of Polaris common stock from Polaris public shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $32.0 million. At March 31, 2019, if all the remaining outstanding shares (approximately 3.13%) of Polaris were tendered at the Exit Price, we would pay additional consideration of approximately $22.3 million in the aggregate.

 In connection with, and as part of the Polaris acquisition, on November 5, 2015, we entered into an amendment with Citigroup Technology, Inc. (“Citi”) and Polaris, which became effective upon the closing of the Polaris Transaction, pursuant to which, (i) Citi agreed to appoint the Company and Polaris as a preferred vendor for Global Technology Resource Strategy (“GTRS”) for the provision of IT services to Citi on an enterprise wide basis (“GTRS Preferred Vendor”), (ii) the Company agreed to certain productivity savings and associated reduced spend commitments for a period of two years, which, if not achieved, would require the Company to provide certain minimum discounts to Citi (which is now satisfied), (iii) the parties amended Polaris’ master services agreement with Citi such that the Company would also be deemed a contracting party and the Company would assume, and agree to perform, or cause Polaris to perform, all applicable obligations under the master services agreement, as amended by the amendment (the “Citi/Virtusa MSA”), and (iv) Virtusa agreed to terminate Virtusa’s existing master services agreement with Citi, and have the Citi/Virtusa MSA be the sole surviving agreement.
 In support of the delisting transaction and the eTouch acquisition, on February 6, 2018, we entered into a $450.0 million credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicated bank group jointly lead by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, which amends and restates our prior $300.0 million credit agreement (which we had originally entered into on February 25, 2016 (“Prior Credit Agreement”) to fund the Polaris acquisition and certain related transactions) and provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, a $180.0 million term loan facility, and a $70.0 million delayed-draw term loan. We drew down $180.0 million under the term loan of the Credit Agreement and $55.0 million under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement to repay in full the amount outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement and fund the Polaris delisting transaction. To fund the eTouch acquisition and Polaris delisting offer, we drew down from our credit facility. Interest under this new credit facility accrues at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 3.0%, subject to step-downs based on the Company’s ratio of debt to EBITDA. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to minimize interest rate exposure. The Credit Agreement includes maximum debt to EBITDA and minimum fixed charge coverage covenants. The term of the Credit Agreement is five years, ending February 6, 2023 (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information). As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding amount under the Credit Agreement was $367.0 million.
 On May 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement with The Orogen Group (“Orogen”) pursuant to which Orogen purchased 108,000 shares of the Company’s newly issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, initially convertible into 3,000,000 shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $108.0 million with an initial conversion price of $36.00 (the “Orogen Preferred Stock Financing”). In connection with the investment, Vikram S. Pandit, the former CEO of Citigroup, was appointed to Virtusa’s Board of Directors. Orogen is a new operating company that was created by Vikram Pandit and Atairos Group, Inc., an independent private company focused on supporting growth‑oriented businesses, to leverage the opportunities created by the evolution of the financial services landscape and to identify and invest in financial services companies and related businesses with proven business models.
 Under the terms of the investment, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a 3.875% dividend per annum, payable quarterly in additional shares of common stock and/or cash at our option. If any shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have not been converted into common stock prior to May 3, 2024, the Company will be required to repurchase such shares at a repurchase price equal to the liquidation preference of the repurchased shares plus the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. If we fail to effect such repurchase, the dividend rate on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will increase by 1% per annum and an additional 1% per annum on each anniversary of May 3, 2024 during the period in which such failure to effect the repurchase is continuing, except that the dividend rate will not increase to more than 6.875% per annum.
 In connection with the investment, we repaid $81.0 million of our outstanding term loan under our Prior Credit Agreement, and our board of directors approved the repurchase of approximately $30.0 million of our common stock. 
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act contains several key tax provisions that will impact the Company, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act also includes a variety of other changes, such as a one-time repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income, base erosion anti-abuse tax payments,  and reduction in the amount of executive pay that could qualify as a tax deduction, among others. During the fiscal year ended

March 31, 2019, the Company elected to treat several foreign entities as disregarded entities. The earnings of these subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. taxation as well as local taxation with a corresponding foreign tax credit, at the election of the Company. (See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information).

 We believe that our application outsourcing services are differentiated because they are based on the principle of migrating installed applications to flexible platforms that can sustain further growth and business change. We do this by:

· | developing a roadmap for the evolution of applications into platforms
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishing an ongoing planning and governance process for managing change
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analyzing applications for common patterns and services
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | identifying application components that can be extended or enhanced as core components
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | integrating new functions, features and technologies into the target architecture
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We continue to strengthen our ability to deliver infrastructure management services (“IMS”) and IT support related services to our clients, helping them manage their IT operations effectively through an offshore outsourced model. We have expanded our investments to deliver seamless infrastructure management services to our clients around the clock, but also to perform these services in an automated, cost‑effective manner. Further, we have invested in building out strong capabilities in improving efficiencies in the developer environment. Our solutions around gamified Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment (“gamified CICD”) and Agile DevOps have helped us create a highly agile development environment that allows our clients to accelerate development cycles, improve time‑to‑market, and become more responsive to changes in markets in which they operate.
 Global delivery model. We have developed an enhanced global delivery model that allows us to provide innovative IT services to our clients in a flexible, cost‑effective and timely manner by leveraging an efficient onsite‑to‑offshore service delivery mix and our proprietary global innovation process (“GIP”), and also enables us to manage and accelerate delivery, foster innovation and promote continual improvement. We manage to a targeted 30% to 70% onsite‑to‑offshore service delivery mix, which allows us to provide value‑added services rapidly and cost‑effectively. During the past three fiscal years, we performed at least 73% of our total annual billable hours at our offshore global delivery centers. However, for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we anticipate the onsite ratio to slightly increase due to new client engagements and existing work on larger, more complex programs requiring a larger onsite presence. Our delivery mix may also fluctuate from time to time due to several other factors, including new and existing client delivery requirements, as well as the impact of any acquisitions. Using our global delivery model, we generally maintain onsite teams at our clients’ locations and offshore teams at one or more of our global delivery centers. Our onsite teams are generally composed of program and project managers, industry experts and senior business and technical consultants. Our offshore teams are generally composed of project managers, technical architects, business analysts and technical consultants. These teams are typically linked together through common processes and collaboration tools and a communications infrastructure that features secure, redundant paths enabling seamless global collaboration. Our global delivery model enables us to provide around the clock, world class execution capabilities that span multiple time zones.
 All of our major delivery centers, located in Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore in India and Colombo in Sri Lanka have been reassessed at CMMI Level 5 maturity. During the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2019, a Global CMMI Program was executed to re-assess all delivery centers - Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore in India and Colombo in Sri Lanka against CMMI certification and maturity levels. This was the first of the initiatives to cover multi-locations and multi-models for CMMI certification. The re-assessment was completed in August 2018. CMMI is a process improvement model used to improve a company’s ability to manage project deliveries to ensure predictable results. CMMI’s process levels are regarded as the standard in the industry for evolutionary paths in software and systems development and management. 
 Our enhanced global delivery model is built around our proprietary GIP, which is a software lifecycle methodology that combines our experience building platform‑based solutions for global clients with leading industry standards such as rational unified process, eXtreme programming, capability maturity model and product line engineering. By leveraging GIP templates, tools and artifacts across diverse disciplines such as requirements management, architecture, design, construction, testing, application outsourcing and production support, each team member is able to leverage software engineering and platforming best practices and extend these benefits to clients.

 During the initial phase of an engagement, we work with the client to define the specific approach and tools that will be used for the engagement. This process tailoring takes into consideration the client’s business objectives, technology environment and currently‑established development approach. We believe our innovative approach to adapting proven techniques into a custom process has been an important differentiator that allows us to deliver substantially greater value to our clients in a cost effective and timely manner.
 The backbone of GIP is our global delivery operations infrastructure. This infrastructure combines enabling tools and specialized teams that assist our project teams with important enabling services such as workforce planning, knowledge management, integrated process and program management and operational reporting and analysis.
 Two important aspects of our global delivery model are innovation and continuous improvement. A dedicated process group provides three important functions: they continually monitor, test and incorporate new approaches, techniques, tools and frameworks into GIP; they advise project teams, particularly during the process‑tailoring phase; and they monitor and audit projects to ensure compliance. New and innovative ideas and approaches are broadly shared throughout the organization, selectively incorporated into GIP and deployed through training. Clients also contribute to innovation and improvement as their ideas and experiences are incorporated into our body of knowledge. We also seek regular informal and formal client feedback. Our global leadership and executive team regularly interact with client leadership and each client is typically given a formal feedback survey on a quarterly basis. Client feedback is qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and forms an important component of our teams’ performance assessments and our continual improvement plans.
 Platforming approach. We apply our innovative platforming approach across our business and IT consulting, technology implementation and application outsourcing services to rationalize IT application portfolios and reduce costs, increase productivity and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our clients’ IT application environments. As part of our platforming approach, we assess our clients’ application environments to identify common elements, such as business processes and rules, technology frameworks and data. We incorporate those common elements into one or more application platforms that can be leveraged across the enterprise to build, enhance and maintain existing and future applications in a leaner environment. Our platforming approach enables our clients to continually improve their software platforms and applications in response to changing business needs and evolving technologies while also realizing long‑term and ongoing cost savings.
 Our platforming approach is embodied in a set of proprietary processes, tools and frameworks that address the fundamental challenges confronting IT executives. These challenges include managing the rising costs of technology ownership, while simultaneously supporting business demands to foster innovation, accelerate time‑to‑market, improve service and enhance productivity. Our platforming approach draws from analogs in industries that standardize on platforms composed of common components and assemblies used across multiple product lines. Similarly, we work with our clients to evolve their diverse software assets into unified, rationalized software platforms. Our platforming approach leads to simplified and standardized software components and assemblies that work together harmoniously and readily adapt to support new business applications. For example, a software platform for trading, once developed within an investment bank, can be the foundation for the bank’s diverse trading applications in equities, bonds and currencies. Our platforming approach stands in contrast to traditional enterprise application development projects, where different applications remain separate and isolated from each other, replicating business logic, technology frameworks and enterprise data.
 At the center of our platforming approach is a five‑level maturity framework that allows us to adapt our service offerings to meet our clients’ unique needs. Level 1 maturity in our platforming approach represents traditional applications where every line of code is embedded and unique to the application and every application is monolithic. Level 2 applications are less monolithic and more flexible and demonstrate characteristics such as configurability and customizability. Level 3 applications are advanced applications where the common code components and software assets are leveraged across multiple application families and product lines. Level 4 applications are framework‑driven where the core business logic is reused with appropriate custom logic built around it. At the highest level of maturity are Level 5 applications, where platforms are greatly leveraged to simplify and accelerate application development and maintenance. At lower levels of maturity, few assets are created and reused. Consequently, agility, total cost of ownership and ability to quickly meet business needs are suboptimal. As organizations mature along this continuum, from Level 1 to Level 5, 

 
  11
 
substantial intellectual property is created and embodied in software platforms that enable steady gains in agility, reduce overall cost of ownership and accelerate time‑to‑market for business applications and services.
 Our platforming approach improves software quality and IT productivity. Software assets within platforms are reused across applications, their robustness and quality improve with time and our clients are able to develop software with fewer defects. A library of ready‑made building blocks significantly enhances productivity and reduces software development risks compared to traditional methods. This establishes a cycle of continual improvement in that the more an enterprise embraces platform‑based solutions, the better the quality of its applications will be, and the less the effort required to build, enhance and maintain them.
 Our IT solutions
 Our go‑to‑market strategy is to support our clients in accelerating business growth, while reducing the cost of IT operations. Our DES solutions help our clients to support business growth initiatives, while our OE solutions allow our clients to improve IT efficiencies and reduce costs. Underlying these two broad solution areas is a set of transformational solution capabilities that support and augment our ability to add value through DES and OE capabilities.
 Digital Engineering Services‑based solutions. Our digital engineering services, or DES solutions, are designed to enable our clients to accelerate business growth by capitalizing on market adjacencies, developing new, complementary market segments, creating compelling digital storefronts, and delivering engaging digital consumer experiences. Our DES solutions harness innovative technology advances in mobility, social media, cloud computing and big data analytics to help our clients modernize their IT application environments and enable their businesses to capitalize on the new wave of consumer demand and expectations.
 We have made significant investments in building out and expanding our digital capabilities including investments in UX and digital consulting. From time to time, we conduct market surveys that help us benchmark our clients’ survey results against the best in their industry. We use these surveys to help our clients develop a roadmap to digitally transform their businesses, leveraging our learning from what the best organizations in the industry are doing.
 We offer the following solutions which enable our clients to address or serve the growing needs of the millennial generation:

 Sales and marketing
 Our global sales, marketing and business development teams seek to develop strong relationships with IT and business executives at prospective and existing clients to establish long‑term business relationships that continue to grow in size and strategic value. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had 430 and 314 marketing and business development full-time equivalent employees, respectively, including sales managers, sales representatives, client service partners, account managers, telemarketers, sales support personnel and marketing professionals. Increased headcount reflects investments in our sales, marketing and business development teams, including an added focus on non-linear and international sales.
 The sales cycle for our services often includes initiating contact with a prospective client, understanding the prospective client’s business challenges and opportunities, performing discovery or assessment activities, submitting proposals, providing client case studies and references and developing proofs‑of‑concept or solution prototypes. We organize our sales teams in strategic business units by geography and with professionals who have specialized industry knowledge. This industry focus enables our sales teams to better understand the prospective client’s business and technology needs and to offer appropriate industry‑focused solutions.
 Sales and sales support. Our sales and sales support teams focus primarily on identifying, targeting and building relationships with prospective clients. These teams are supported in their efforts by industry specialists, technology consultants and solution architects, who work together to design client‑specific solution proposals. Our sales and sales support teams are based in offices throughout the United States, Europe and Asia.
 Account management. We assign experienced account managers who build and regularly update detailed account development plans for each of our clients. These managers are responsible for developing strong working relationships across the client organization, working day‑to‑day with the client and our service delivery teams to understand and address the client’s needs. Our account managers work closely with our clients to develop a detailed understanding of their business objectives and technology environments. We use this knowledge to identify and target additional consulting engagements and other outsourcing opportunities.
 Marketing. We maintain a marketing presence in the United States, Europe (including the United Kingdom), India, and Sri Lanka. Our marketing team seeks to build our brand awareness and generate target lists and sales leads through industry events, press releases, thought leadership publications, direct marketing campaigns and referrals from clients, strategic alliances and industry analysts. The marketing team maintains frequent contact with industry analysts and experts to understand market trends and dynamics.
 Strategic alliances. We have strategic alliances with software companies, some of which are also our clients, to provide services to their customers. We believe these alliances differentiate us from our competition. Our extensive engineering, quality assurance and technology implementation and support services to software companies enable us to compete more effectively for the technology implementation and support services required by their customers. In addition, our strategic alliances with software companies allow us to share sales leads, develop joint account plans and engage in joint marketing activities.
 Clients and industry expertise
 We market and provide our services to companies in North America, Europe and Asia. For additional discussion regarding geographic information, see Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. A majority of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was generated from Forbes Global 2000 firms or their subsidiaries. We believe that our regular, direct interaction with senior executives at these clients, the breadth of our client relationships and our reputation within these clients as a thought leader differentiate us from our competitors. The strength of our relationships has resulted in significant recurring revenue from existing clients. For instance, our largest client for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Citi, accounted for 18% of our total revenue, and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, accounted for 19% and 17%, respectively.
 We focus primarily on three industries: C&T, BFSI and M&I. We build expertise in these industries through our customer experience and industry alliances by hiring industry specialists and by training our business analysts and other 

 
  14
 
team members in industry‑specific topics. Drawing on this expertise, we strive to develop industry‑specific perspectives and services.
 Communications and technology. For our communications clients, we focus on customer service, sales and billing functions, and regulatory compliance, helping them improve service levels, reduce time‑to‑market and modernize their IT environments. For our technology clients, which include hardware manufacturers and software companies, we provide a wide range of industry‑specific service offerings, including product management services, product architecture, engineering and quality assurance services, and professional services to support product implementation and integration. These clients often employ cutting‑edge technology and generally require strong technical skills and a deep understanding of the software product lifecycle.
 Banking, financial services and insurance. We provide services to clients in the retail, wholesale and investment banking areas; financial transaction processors; and insurance companies encompassing life, property and casualty and health insurance. For our BFSI clients, we have developed industry specific services for each of these sectors, such as an account opening framework for banks, compliance services for financial institutions, and customer self‑service solutions for insurance companies. The need to rationalize and consolidate legacy applications is pervasive across these industries and we have tailored our platforming approach to address these challenges.
 Media and information. We focus primarily on solutions involving electronic publishing, online learning, content management, information workflow and mobile content delivery as well as personalization, search technology and digital rights management. Many M&I providers are focused on building common platforms that provide customized content from multiple sources, customized and delivered to many consumers using numerous delivery mechanisms. We believe our platforming approach is ideally suited to these opportunities.
 Competition
 The IT services market in which we operate is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting client needs and expectations. This market includes a large number of participants from a variety of market segments, including:
· | offshore IT outsourcing firms, such as Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, HCL Technologies Limited, Infosys Technologies Limited, Capgemini Service SAS, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Tech Mahindra Limited and Wipro Limited
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | consulting and systems integration firms, such as Accenture PLC., Capgemini Service SAS, Computer Sciences Corporation, Deloitte Consulting LLP and IBM Global Services
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We also occasionally compete with in‑house IT departments, smaller vertically‑focused IT service providers and local IT service providers based in the geographic areas where we compete. For instance on the digital enablement side, we often compete with established digital services firms like Globant or EPAM systems, as well as smaller vendors that compete on the basis of local presence, pricing and niche solutions/capabilities.
 We expect additional competition from offshore IT outsourcing firms in emerging locations such as Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, offshore IT service providers with facilities in less expensive geographies within India and lower cost, near shore centers established by our competitors to provide accelerated staffing alternatives at competitive pricing.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, a breadth of service offerings to provide one‑stop solutions to clients, a well‑developed recruiting, training and retention model, responsiveness to clients’ business needs, and quality of services. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Many of our competitors, however, have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and a greater number of IT professionals than we do. We cannot assure you that we will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition.

 Human resources
 Our human resource strategy in Virtusa is based on the philosophy of “ATTRACTRETAIN GROW”. Our human capital development framework is aligned to our ability to hire, retain and grow which allows us to invest in the development of our team members in a focused manner, while keeping our team members culturally anchored to our core values. We are able to accomplish this by focusing our people management strategy on six key components: recruiting, performance management, training and development, employee engagement and communication, as well as compensation and retention. Our people management strategy also includes engaging subcontractors at all of our locations, especially in niche or hard to hire skills, on an as needed basis for specific client engagements.
 Recruiting. To satisfy our clients’ needs, we need to ensure that we hire the best in market. Our global recruiting and hiring process address our need for a large number of highly‑skilled team members. Our hiring strategy includes three critical components; create employer brand through various social channels; build campus relationships to improve quality; and sustain employee brand through market recognitions. We have successfully created a robust platform which helps us with a rigorous and efficient selection process to hire the best fit. 
 We have repeatedly won Candidate Experience Awards for delivering outstanding experiences to candidates throughout the recruitment process in geographies like North America and APAC. In our fiscal year 2019, we won Candidate Experience Awards in North America, APAC and United Kingdom.
 Over the years our campus hiring program has become robust both in India and Sri Lanka. We have taken a step forward in campus reach by creating “Centre of Excellence” (COE) where we partner with colleges to develop IT curriculum, support and train their faculty and award sponsorships. Our COE initiative in India commenced in the year 2014 and has grown from five colleges to twenty-four colleges during our fiscal year 2019. We have established eighteen COEs in sixteen colleges spread across India. These COEs focus on current and futuristic skills like Java, Data Science, Big Data, Talend, Cloud, CRM, specialized testing, BPM, front end engineering and Adobe CQ. This has resulted in a reduction of in‑house training days post‑hiring. These programs have helped us improve the quality of hires, and decrease the time needed to make our team members project‑ready.
 Performance management. We became one of the trend setters in the industry by taking the step of moving away from the traditional way of measuring employee performance and adopted a new platform called REPS (Real‑time Engagement and Performance Score). REPS is developed internally by our team and captures most of the performance areas on a real‑time basis. The platform focuses on the need of having a transparent and gamified performance system for our workforce. The platform also captures the engagement level of our team members, not just by measuring our team members on certain key performance areas, but also on measuring them on their self‑development, their teamwork and their impact on our overall organization. Real‑time performance data is visible to everyone, enabling a continuous feedback mechanism, which fosters trust, and empowers employees to be accountable for their performance in real time and not semi‑annually as in the earlier framework. We have a roadmap for scaling up for larger population in the coming years. We won the Silver International Stevie Award for HR Department of the Year for innovation in employee empowerment.
 Training and development. While we focus on hiring the best talent, our primary focus is on developing and reskilling our team members to ensure our team members remain relevant from a technology standpoint. We also focus on social learning through digital platforms to enable our team members to collaborate and mentor each other in new technologies. In fiscal year 2019, we were able to deliver an average of 46 hours of training to our team members, resulting in higher deployment and higher retention as compared to the previous fiscal year. Virtusa has been recognized by ATD (Association for Talent Development) for the successful implementation of our Employee Learning week that we conducted in December 2017. A key continued focus area is leadership development. Virtusa has evolved the GOLD (Global One Leadership Development) Program in partnership with reputed training organizations to coach and build leaders who can manage large scale and strategic programs for the company.
 Employee engagement and communication. We strongly believe that open communication is essential to our team‑oriented culture. Through regular company‑wide updates from senior management, complemented by team member sessions at the regional, local and account levels, as well as regular town hall sessions, we ensure that we engage and interact with all our employees to optimize individual career paths while fostering a team culture. We use a digital platform 

 
  16
 
called RAVE for acknowledging each other on a real‑time basis on good work performed by our team members. We also use the platform to promote the pursuit of excellence, integrity, respect and leadership (PIRL) which are our core values. Yammer is another social digital business platform that we widely use to interact and share ideas and information with our colleagues. This strengthens collaboration and facilitates knowledge sharing, while driving transparency. We have been certified as one of the UK’s Top Employers for the 8th consecutive year, providing excellent employee conditions, nurturing talent, and striving to continuously improve employment practices.
 Compensation. For compensation, we use a total reward strategy which strives to design, administer and communicate the most effective reward programs with maximum motivational impact to drive desired behaviors. Our compensation strategy is based on a “3P” model which gives equal weight to Pay for Person (person premium based on competency assessment, skill and market demand); Pay for Position (position evaluation and market pay level) and Pay for Performance (individual contributions and organization’s performance). We consistently benchmark our compensation and benefits with relevant market data in the industry. Our compensation philosophy rewards performance by linking both variable compensation and salary increases to performance.
 Retention. To attract, retain and motivate our team members, we seek to provide an environment that rewards entrepreneurial initiatives, adaptive leadership and performance. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, we experienced voluntary team member attrition at a rate of 16.4% and involuntary team member attrition at a rate of 9.1%. We remain committed to improving and sustaining our voluntary attrition levels consistent with our long‑term stated goals.
 We ensure retention of the right talent in the organization through various initiatives like:

· | providing re‑skilling and development opportunities to our team members
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sharing clear career paths with the team members and doing timely rotations so that team members get better exposure
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing team members opportunities to interact with our clients in their transformational journey
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creating a transparent performance management system where team members can see each other’s achievements through leader boards, thus inducing a competitive yet healthy work culture
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing digital tools to ensure that team members are able to share their views cutting across all levels of the organization on a non‑moderated platform
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ensuring that team members own their performance by focusing on self‑development, knowing how to contribute to the team, and being aware of how they can make an impact on the overall organization
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adopting a system to manage our people‑related transactions in a more efficient way based mainly on self‑service modules, hence empowering our leaders and their team members to take faster and informed decisions related to people matters
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  At March 31, 2019, we had 21,745 team members worldwide. We also engage outside contractors from time to time to supplement our services on an as needed basis. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relations with our team members to be good.
 Network and infrastructure
 Our global IT infrastructure is designed to provide uninterrupted service to our clients. Through a combination of targeted investments and a strong understanding of the emerging cybersecurity trends, we currently have a mature capability that can support any specific security and compliance requirements that our clients may have, in addition to the industry best‑in‑class safeguards that we already use to protect the client’s network and infrastructure.

 
  17
 

 We use a secure, high‑performance communications network to enable our clients’ systems to connect seamlessly to each of our offshore global delivery centers. We provide flexibility for our clients to operate their engagements from any of our offshore global delivery centers by using mainstream network topologies, including site‑to‑site virtual private networks, international private leased circuits and multiprotocol label switching. We also provide videoconferencing, voice conferencing and Voice over Internet Protocol capabilities to our global delivery teams and clients to enable clear and uninterrupted communication in our engagements, be it intra‑company or with our clients.
 We monitor our network performance on a 24×7 basis to ensure high levels of network availability and periodically upgrade our network to enhance and optimize network efficiency across all operating locations. We use leased telecommunication lines to provide redundant data and voice communication with our clients’ facilities and among all of our facilities in Asia, the United States and Europe. We also maintain multiple sites across our global delivery centers in Asia, particularly our largest centers in India and Sri Lanka, and the United States back‑up centers to provide for continuity of infrastructure and resources in the case of natural disasters or other events that may cause a business interruption.
 Our network infrastructure is secured using two factor authentication for remote access, mobile device management, data loss prevention, advanced malware protection and periodic external vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. We are ISO 27001 and ISO 22301 certified in all our major delivery centers to safeguard clients’ and Virtusa’s own information assets, and believe that we meet all our clients’ stringent security requirements for ongoing business with them.
 Intellectual property
 We believe that our continued success depends in part on the skills of our team members, the ability of our team members to continue to innovate and our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and design laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary methodologies. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our team members and consultants that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. We have also designed procedures to generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We pursue the registration of certain of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and other countries. We have registered the mark “Virtusa” in the United States, the European Community and India and have filed for registration of “Virtusa” in Sri Lanka. We have registered in the United States the service marks “BPM Test Drive” which we use to describe our consulting service offering involving business process management or BPM project implementation and “ACCELERATING BUSINESS OUTCOMES,” which we use to describe the benefits of our services. We have one issued patent and several pending patent applications.
 Our business involves the development of IT applications and other technology deliverables for our clients. Our clients usually own the intellectual property in the software applications that we develop for them. We generally implement safeguards designed to protect our clients’ intellectual property in accordance with their needs and specifications. Our means of protecting our and our clients’ proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent or deter infringement or other unauthorized use of our and our clients’ intellectual property. Legal protections afford only limited protection for intellectual property rights and the laws of India and Sri Lanka do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as those of the United States and the United Kingdom. Time‑consuming and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce these intellectual property rights.
 In addition, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property or the intellectual property that we develop for our clients does not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Defending against such claims, even if they are not meritorious, could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company. If we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights, we could be required to indemnify our client(s), pay substantial damage awards and be forced to develop non‑infringing technology, obtain licenses, or cease delivery of the applications that contain the infringing technology.

 Virtusa Sustainability Program
 Our sustainability program is based on the following core elements: health and safety, environment, business continuity management, information security, labor standards and diversity, anti-bribery and corruption, and management engagement and social impact. Our sustainability program is backed by relevant certifications, policies, and employee training for these core areas. This includes certification for OHSAS 18001:2007 (health and safety), ISO 14001:2015 (environmental management), ISO 22301:2012 (business continuity), and ISO 27001:2013 (information security). 
 The significant environmental aspects of our business operations are managed through, our environmental management system. We have set metrics to monitor and target the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, and water usage. We also recycle e-waste and paper. We believe that this transparency and reporting has enabled us to improve our sustainability program continuously. As such, our emissions data for scopes 1, 2, and 3 have limited assurance under ISAE3000 from Ernst & Young. In addition, we report our emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Climate Change program, and the Supply Chain program. In 2018, we received a performance rating of "B" (Management band), which is higher than the general average (B-) and the North American regional average (C). Our Supplier Engagement Rating for 2018 was “A-”. 
 We focus on strategic corporate social responsibility projects that provide long-term value. In 2018, we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Biodiversity Sri Lanka to partner in a forest restoration program, which aims to restore 10 hectares of degraded land in the Kanneliya Forest Reserve in Sri Lanka. The project will be carried out under the guidance of the Forest Department Sri Lanka and the technical expertise of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
 Business segments and geographic information
 We view our operations and manage our business as one operating segment. For information regarding net revenue by geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years, see Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 contained in this Annual Report.
