Item 1. Business
Overview
In 2021, we completed the tax-free spin-off of our oncology programs and portfolio to become a company focused on the pursuit of curative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases. Today, bluebird bio, Inc. has industry-leading, late-stage clinical and research programs for the treatment of sickle cell disease ("SCD"), β-thalassemia and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy ("CALD") and is advancing research to apply new technologies to these and other diseases. Using a proprietary lentiviral vector ("LVV") platform, we custom design each of our therapies to address the underlying cause of disease by introducing a functional copy of a gene to patients’ own isolated hematopoietic stem cells ("HSCs"). In a rapidly advancing field, we have developed in-depth analytical methods to understand the safety of our LVV technologies, which are designed to deliver a sustained, lifelong response from a one-time treatment and to improve upon allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ("HSCT"), which carries significant limitations, including the ability to identify matched donors, risk of transplant-related graft-vs-host disease ("GVHD") and death, as well as to improve upon current treatment approaches used with patients not currently eligible to receive allogeneic HSCT. We have the largest and deepest ex vivo gene therapy data set in the industry, with more than 500 patient years of experience. We are also investing in research and development to expand the potential impact of our existing ex vivo programs through development of reduced toxicity conditioning and alternative HSC mobilization regimens, as well as in manufacturing process improvements. Long-term, we seek to build our pipeline by investing in in vivo applications of our LVV platform and advancement of our direct injection preclinical candidates.
European withdrawal
We announced our intent to wind down our operations in Europe and to focus on the U.S. market. The decision to discontinue operations in Europe resulted from prolonged negotiations with European payers and challenges to achieving appropriate value recognition and market access for ZYNTEGLO™ for the treatment of β-thalassemia. Following the exploration of potentially out-licensing the ex-U.S. rights to our three lead programs, we made the decision to withdraw the regulatory marketing authorizations for SKYSONA™ and ZYNTEGLO from the European Union and to withdraw our marketing applications for SKYSONA and ZYNTEGLO from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. We are continuing the long-term follow-up of patients previously enrolled within the clinical trial programs in Europe as planned but do not intend to initiate any new clinical trials in Europe for β-thalassemia, CALD or SCD.
Our Programs 
Lovotibeglogene autotemcel
We are developing lovotibeglogene autotemcel ("lovo-cel", formerly referred to as "LentiGlobin for SCD") as a one-time treatment for patients with SCD, a serious, progressive and debilitating genetic disease caused by a single mutation in the β-globin gene that leads to the production of abnormal sickle hemoglobin ("HbS"). HbS causes red blood cells ("RBCs") to become sickled and fragile, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vasculopathy and unpredictable, painful vaso-occlusive events ("VOEs"), requiring frequent hospitalization. In the United States, the median age of death for someone with sickle cell disease is 43 to 46 years. Additionally, one in four people living with sickle cell disease experience a stroke by age 45. 
Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for lovo-cel in the United States on the basis of clinical data from Group C of the HGB-206 Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We have treated all of the patients who will form the primary efficacy data set, with the demonstration of analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process as the key remaining actions prior to submission of our planned BLA for lovo-cel.
Our approach in SCD involves the ex vivo insertion of the normal β-globin gene with the T87Q amino acid substitution into the patient’s own HSCs using LVV, to enable formation of normally functioning hemoglobin A and normal RBCs in patients. T87Q serves as a distinct biomarker used to quantify expression levels of the functional β-globin protein in patients with SCD, while also providing anti-sickling properties. Lovo-cel has been granted Fast Track Designation for the treatment of SCD, Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of SCD, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy ("RMAT") Designation for the treatment of SCD, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of SCD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").

We are conducting, or have conducted, the following clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lovo-cel in the treatment of patients with SCD:
•The HGB-206 study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site Phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lovo-cel. A total of 45 patients were treated with lovo-cel in this study across three treatment cohorts. Patients must have been at least twelve years of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with βS/βS, βS/β+ or βS/β0 genotype. Patients must have had recurrent severe VOEs and must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. We refer to patients treated in the HGB-206 study under the amended study protocol utilizing HSCs from peripheral blood after mobilization with plerixafor as patients in “Group C” (n=36) rather than utilizing HSCs collected via bone marrow harvest, as in Groups A (n=7) and B (n=2). A refined manufacturing process designed to increase vector copy number and further protocol refinements made to improve engraftment potential of gene-modified stem cells were also used for Group C. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is complete resolution of severe VOEs, between six and 18 months post-treatment, and the secondary efficacy endpoint for this study is globin response based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin. Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal predominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be invited to enroll in LTF-307, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•HGB-210 is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site, Phase 3 clinical study in the United States to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovo-cel in the treatment of patients with SCD, with a target enrollment of 35 pediatric and adult patients. We expect to include data from HGB-210 in our planned BLA submission for lovo-cel to demonstrate analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process. Patients must be at least two years of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with βS/βS, βS/β+ or βS/β0 genotype, subject to resolution of the partial clinical hold applicable to enrollment of pediatric patients. Patients must have recurrent severe VOEs and must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. The patients must also be eligible for HSCT. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is complete resolution of severe VOEs, between six and 18 months post-treatment, and the secondary efficacy endpoint for this study includes globin response based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin. Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal predominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be invited to enroll in LTF-307, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years.
•HGB-205 is a completed proof-of-concept, single-center Phase 1/2 study in France of three patients with SCD which also enrolled patients with β-thalassemia. Those with SCD must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea and have an additional poor prognostic risk factor (e.g., recurrent vaso-occlusive crises ("VOCs"), or acute chest syndrome). All patients must have been eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched sibling allogeneic HSCT donor. The primary objective of our HGB-205 study was to determine the safety, tolerability and success of engraftment of the drug product. The secondary objectives of the study were to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment on disease-specific biological parameters and clinical events. In the case of patients with TDT and SCD, this meant the volume of RBC transfusions, and for patients with SCD, it also meant the number of VOCs and acute chest syndrome in each patient, compared with the two-year period prior to treatment. Safety evaluations performed during the study included success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal predominance or leukemia/ lymphoma. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then was invited to enroll in LTF-307, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•LTF-307 is the long-term follow-up study for patients with SCD from our HGB-205, HGB-206, or HGB-210 studies who were treated with lovo-cel once they complete the original study protocol’s follow-up period of approximately two years. Under LTF-307, patients will be followed for approximately an additional 13 years for a total of approximately 15 years post-treatment. 
In December 2021, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our clinical program for lovo-cel for patients under the age of 18. The partial hold relates to our ongoing investigation into an adolescent patient with persistent, non-transfusion-dependent anemia 18 months post-treatment with lovo-cel. During the partial clinical hold, we anticipate continuing our clinical study 
activities as planned for patients 18 and older in our HGB-206 Group C and HGB-210 studies, as well as follow-up activities for treated patients of all ages in all studies. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for lovo-cel in the United States on the basis of clinical data from HGB-206 Group C, supportive data from HGB-210 for safety and analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process. We have treated all of the patients who will form the primary efficacy dataset for the planned BLA submission, with the demonstration of analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process as the key remaining actions prior to submission of our planned BLA for lovo-cel. 
At the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December 2021, we presented interim data from our lovo-cel program with a data cut-off date as of February 17, 2021, as summarized below: 
•A total of 49 patients had been treated with lovo-cel, with up to six years of patient follow-up, in the HGB-205 (n=3), HGB-206 (n=44), and HGB-210 (n=2) clinical studies. The HGB-206 total included: Group A (n=7), Group B (n=2), and Group C (n=35), representing progressive adaptations to the manufacturing and treatment processes. 
•The 35 Group C patients had up to 37.6 months of follow-up (median of 17.3; min-max: 3.7-37.6 months), for a total of 54.8 patient-years of experience. In HGB-206 Group C, no severe VOEs were reported with up to 36 months of follow-up in patients with a history of at least four severe VOEs and at least six months of follow-up. Following engraftment, median total hemoglobin for these patients increased from 8.5 g/dL at baseline to ≥11 g/dL from six through up to 36 months post-infusion; notably, HbS in all patients was less than 60% of total hemoglobin, and gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, contributed at least 40% of total hemoglobin. All evaluable patients (n=25) continued to experience complete resolution of severe VOEs through up to 36 months of follow-up, compared with a median of 3.5 per year (min-max: 2.0-13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment.
•The safety data for lovo-cel remained generally consistent with the risks of autologous stem cell transplantation and myeloablative single-agent busulfan conditioning, as well as underlying SCD. There were no reports of GVHD, graft failure, replication-competent lentivirus, or vector-mediated insertional oncogenesis in any patient treated in HGB-206. One non-serious, Grade 2 adverse event ("AE") of febrile neutropenia was considered related to lovo-cel. There were no serious AEs related to lovo-cel in Group C. In HGB-206 Group C, one patient with underlying cardiopulmonary disease and SCD-related complications died 20 months post-treatment; the investigator and an independent monitoring committee agreed his death was unlikely related to lovo-cel. In HGB-206 Group A, two patients treated with lovo-cel developed acute myeloid leukemia ("AML"). Following investigation of the cases, it was determined that these were unlikely related to lentiviral insertion from lovo-cel. The underlying increased risk of hematologic malignancies in SCD, combined with the transplant procedure and associated proliferative stress, as well as continued hematopoietic stress due to minimal clinical benefit in these two Group A patients (drug product manufactured using stem cells collected via bone marrow harvest and using a previous manufacturing process which has since been discontinued) may have contributed to the development of acute myeloid leukemia.
•In HGB-206 Group C, key hemolysis markers approached normal levels, suggesting a reduction in hemolysis: lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin levels normalized, reticulocyte counts approached normal levels, and haptoglobin levels were detected at last visit. 
•Based on exploratory assay data evaluating HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs to assess pancellularity of HbAT87Q, a mean of 85% of RBCs containing βA-T87Q was observed in ten patients with at least 24 months of follow-up, suggesting near-pancellular HbAT87Q distribution and with pancellularity observed to be increasing over time. Within HbAT87Q-containing RBCs, the median HbAT87Q was estimated to be 15.3 pg per RBCs (range: 11.7 to 22.7).
•Integration site analysis data in HGB-206 Group C also demonstrated greater diversity detected in lentiviral vector insertion sites, which is attributed to improvements implemented for Group C. 
Betibeglogene autotemcel
The BLA for betibeglogene autotemcel ("beti-cel") is currently under review by the FDA for β-thalassemia in patients who receive regular RBC transfusions. The BLA for beti-cel was accepted for filing and granted priority review and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") goal date is August 19, 2022. 
β-thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the production of defective RBCs. The disease is characterized by severe anemia, and the ineffective production of RBCs can lead to a range of multi-systemic complications, including but not limited to splenomegaly, marrow expansion, bone deformities, and iron overload in major organs (as a result of blood transfusions needed to treat the disease). Patients with β-thalassemia require time-consuming, 
highly-specialized care for life with many patients receiving RBC transfusions every two to four weeks. More than 80 percent of people with β-thalassemia are living with at least one complication from their disease, and patients have a mortality rate that is five times that of the general population. Our approach involves using LVV to insert the normal β-globin gene with a single amino acid substitution into the patient’s own HSCs ex vivo, to enable formation of normal RBCs, in patients. Beti-cel refers to the β-thalassemia patients' own cells that have undergone our ex vivo manufacturing process resulting in genetically modified HSCs. 
The BLA is based on data from patients treated in our Phase 3 HGB-207 and HGB-212 studies, as well as the phase 1/2 HGB-204 and HGB-205 studies. Beti-cel has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA for the treatment of β-thalassemia and was granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of β-thalassemia major. The FDA previously granted beti-cel Orphan Drug status, Breakthrough Therapy designation and Rare Pediatric Disease designation for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. 
We are conducting, or have conducted, the following clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with β-thalassemia:
•HGB-207 is an ongoing single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel to treat patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia ("TDT") and non-β0/β0 genotypes. Twenty-three patients were enrolled and completed dosing in the study, consisting of 15 adolescent and adult patients between 12 and 50 years of age at enrollment, and eight pediatric patients less than 12 years of age at enrollment. Age at enrollment ranged from four to 34 years old. To be enrolled, patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the past two years. All patients must have been eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched family HSCT donor. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of treated patients who achieve transfusion independence, defined as weighted average hemoglobin levels ≥9.0 g/dL without any RBC transfusions for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any time during the study after treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study are designed to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel on transfusion requirements and clinical events. Safety evaluations performed during the study include success and kinetics of platelet and neutrophil engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal predominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years.
•HGB-212 is an ongoing single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of beti-cel to treat patients with TDT who have either a β0/β0, β0/IVS-I-110, or IVS-I-110/IVS-I-110 genotypes. Eighteen patients were enrolled and completed dosing in the study, consisting of ten adolescent and adult patients between twelve and 50 years of age at enrollment, and eight patients less than twelve years of age at enrollment. To be eligible, patients must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the past two years. All patients must have been clinically stable and eligible to undergo HSCT and been treated and followed for at least the last two years in a specialized center that maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of treated patients who meet the definition of transfusion independence. The secondary endpoints of this study are designed to measure the proportion of patients who meet the definition of transfusion reduction, which is defined as demonstration of reduction in volume of RBC transfusion requirements (in mL/kg) in the post-treatment time period of months 12 to 24 compared to the average annual transfusion requirement in the 24 months prior to enrollment, to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel on transfusion requirements post-treatment and clinical events. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years.
•HGB-204 is a completed, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site Phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States, Australia and Thailand to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in increasing hemoglobin production and the proportion of treated patients who meet the definition of transfusion independence. This study was completed in February 2018, and patients in this study were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol to assess safety and efficacy beyond the study follow-up period. Eighteen adults and adolescents were treated in the study. To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients were between 12 and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT and received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year in each of the two years preceding enrollment. The patients were also medically eligible for allogeneic HSCT. Efficacy was evaluated primarily by the production of ≥2.0 g/dL of hemoglobin A containing βA-T87Q-globin for the six-month period between 18- and 24-months post-treatment.

Exploratory efficacy endpoints included RBC transfusion requirements per month and per year, post-treatment. Safety evaluations performed during the study included success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal predominance or leukemia. Subjects were monitored by regular screening. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months from time of consent and then was invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years.
•HGB-205 is a completed, proof-of-concept, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, Phase 1/2 clinical study conducted at a single site in France to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in four patients with β-thalassemia that also enrolled patients with SCD. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months from time of consent and then was invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years.
•LTF-303 is the long-term follow-up study for patients with β-thalassemia from our HGB-204, HGB-205, HGB-207, or HGB-212 studies who were treated with beti-cel once they complete the original study protocol’s follow-up period of approximately two years. Under LTF-303, patients will be followed for approximately an additional 13 years for a total of approximately 15 years post-treatment. 
In December 2021, we presented the following updated long-term follow up clinical data from HGB-204, HGB-205, HGB-207, HGB-212, and LTF-303 at the ASH Annual Meeting, with a data cut-off date as of August 18, 2021: 
•A total of 63 pediatric, adolescent and adult patients, including 20 patients with at least five years of follow-up, 11 with at least six years and three with up to seven years across β0/β0 and non-β0/β0 genotypes, have been treated with beti-cel across our clinical studies. After participating in and completing the two years of follow-up in any of the Phase 1/2 (HGB-204, HGB-205) or Phase 3 studies (HGB-207, HGB-212), patients treated with beti-cel were invited to enroll in LTF-303. 57 of 63 beti-cel-treated patients across age groups and genotypes spanning a broad range of the most severe β0/β0 and non-β0/β0 genotypes were enrolled in LTF-303 (22 treated in Phase 1/2 studies, 35 treated in Phase 3 studies) with a median post-infusion follow-up of 41.5 months (min-max: 23-87.5). Twenty patients enrolled in LTF-303 had at least five years of follow-up.
•Of the 57 patients enrolled in LTF-303, 46 patients achieved transfusion independence: 15/22 (68%) patients treated in Phase 1/2 and 31/35 (89%) patients treated in Phase 3. All 46 patients who achieved transfusion independence maintained it through last follow-up in LTF-303, demonstrating the long-term durability of beti-cel. Phase 1/2 patients had a median duration of ongoing transfusion independence of 65.9 months (min-max: 19.8-84.5) and Phase 3 patients had a median ongoing transfusion independence duration of 32 months (min-max: 18.2-49.1). Weighted average hemoglobin in patients who achieved transfusion independence reached normal or near-normal levels in the Phase 1/2 studies (10.3 g/dL; min-max: 9.1-13.2) and in the Phase 3 studies (11.6 g/dL; min-max: 9.5-13.7).
•Patients with β-thalassemia who require regular blood transfusions need to reduce excess iron caused by chronic blood transfusions, including by chelation (pharmacological removal). Prior to beti-cel infusion, all patients in our clinical studies were on iron chelation. Importantly, the majority of patients who achieved transfusion independence (n=46/57) that restarted iron chelation after infusion have since stopped (59%, 20/34); and 24% of those who achieved transfusion independence (11/46) were able to receive phlebotomy (blood removal), which is another method for iron reduction that is only possible for patients who have sufficient hemoglobin levels without RBC transfusions. We believe this result supports the potential for beti-cel to reduce the treatment burden associated with iron management. 
•The majority of AEs and SAEs in the beti-cel clinical development program were unrelated to beti-cel and consistent with the known side effects of HSC collection and busulfan conditioning regimen (including several SAEs of veno-occlusive disease that resolved with treatment). Adverse reactions considered related to beti-cel were few and consisted primarily of non-serious infusion-related reactions that occurred on the day of infusion (e.g., abdominal pain, hot flush, dyspnea, tachycardia and non-cardiac chest pain) and cytopenias (e.g. thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and neutropenia). Pain in extremity shortly after treatment was also documented. One of these AEs was a SAE of thrombocytopenia considered possibly related to beti-cel and resolved. There were no deaths, no vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus, and no events of insertional oncogenesis or malignancy.
In June 2019, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for beti-cel, marketed as ZYNTEGLO gene therapy, for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia who do not have a β0/β0 genotype, for whom HSCT is appropriate but an HLA-matched related HSC donor is not available. We have 
submitted a request for the withdrawal of the marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO in the European Union, to be effective in the first half of 2022. 
Elivaldogene autotemcel
The BLA for elivaldogene autotemcel (“eli-cel”) is currently under review by the FDA for treatment of patients less
than 18 years of age with early CALD who do not have an available and willing HLA-matched sibling HSC donor. The
BLA for eli-cel was accepted for filing and granted priority review, and the PDUFA goal date is September 16, 2022
CALD is the most severe form of adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare X-linked metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which results in accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids ("VLCFAs") in plasma and tissues, leading to a range of clinical outcomes. CALD involves a progressive destruction of myelin, the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for thinking and muscle control. Symptoms of CALD usually occur in early childhood and progress rapidly if untreated, leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death in most patients. Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene into the patient’s own HSCs via LVV . Following engraftment, we expect the transduced HSCs to differentiate into other cell types, including macrophages and cerebral microglia, which produce functional ALDP. We believe that the functional ALDP can then enable the local degradation of VLCFAs in the brain, which in turn can stabilize the disease by preventing further cerebral inflammation and demyelination that are characteristics of CALD.
Our eli-cel program has been subject to an ongoing clinical hold since mid-2021 when we received a report of myelodysplastic syndrome ("MDS"). We believe this initial case of MDS was related to eli-cel and likely mediated by Lenti-D LVV insertion. Consistent with this known risk, additional treatment-related cases of MDS have subsequently been reported, and all patients who received eli-cel in the clinical program continue to be monitored in accordance with study protocols. On February 23, 2022, the FDA notified us that the clinical hold on the eli-cel program would remain in place, and requested additional information about safety events and monitoring in the eli-cel clinical program.  The FDA previously granted eli-cel Orphan Drug designation, Rare Pediatric Disease designation, and Breakthrough Therapy designation. 
The BLA for eli-cel is supported by efficacy and safety data from 32 patients dosed in ALD-102, the completed Phase 2/3 Starbeam study, and 23 patients dosed in ALD-104, the Phase 3 study, which has enrolled a total of 35 patients. All patients who completed ALD-102, as well as those who will complete ALD-104, are invited to participate in LTF-304, a long-term follow-up study. In ALD-102, 90.6% (29/32) of patients met the primary endpoint of Major Functional Disabilities ("MFD")-free survival at 24 months. Two patients withdrew from study ALD-102 at investigator discretion, and one additional subject experienced rapid disease progression early in the study, resulting in MFDs and subsequent death. The median duration of follow-up was 3.5 years (42.3 months; 13.4, 83.7). Adverse reactions attributed to eli-cel observed in clinical trials have included MDS, cystitis viral, pancytopenia, and vomiting. There have been no reports of graft-versus-host-disease, graft failure or rejection, transplant-related mortality, or replication competent lentivirus in the 55 patients who have received eli-cel in clinical studies as of the data cut-off date.
The ALD-103 study is a completed observational prospective/ partially retrospective data collection study of 59 patients with CALD ≤17 years of age who received allogeneic HSCT. This study was designed to collect efficacy and safety outcomes data in patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT in a period that is contemporaneous with ALD-102. We anticipate that eli-cel safety and efficacy will be evaluated by the FDA in light of the data collected in ALD-102 and ALD-104 in conjunction with ALD-103 as well as our completed retrospective observational ALD-101 study.
In July 2021, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for eli-cel as a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of early cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for whom a human leukocyte antigen ("HLA")-matched sibling HSC donor is not available. We have withdrawn the marketing authorization of SKYSONA in the European Union, effective in December 2021.
Manufacturing activities 
We have entered into multi-year agreements with external manufacturing partners to support our programs in the United States. We have multi-year agreements with SAFC Carlsbad, Inc. ("SAFC", a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma), and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (previously Novasep) in the production of LVV. In addition, we have entered into multi-year agreements with Lonza Houston, Inc. and Minaris Regenerative Medicine ("Minaris") to produce drug product. In addition, we rely on specialized third-party testing organizations to confirm the quality of LVV and drug product prior to their use in clinical trials and in the commercial context. 
We believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to effectively oversee these contract manufacturing activities, and to compile 
manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions and commercialization efforts. For the treatment of patients with our drug product in the commercial setting following approval if and when received, we are collaborating with participating apheresis centers in the United States, which we refer to as qualified treatment centers, to be centers for collection of HSCs from the patient and for infusion of drug product to the patient.
Adherent cell culture is used to manufacture beti-cel and eli-cel LVV. Large-scale suspension bioreactor process is currently used to manufacture clinical supply of lovo-cel LVV, while adherent cell culture for the manufacture of LVV was used initially in the clinical development of lovo-cel. We are also planning a clinical study to demonstrate the comparability of using cryopreserved patient starting material for the manufacture of drug product, which, if successful, would expand the patient population that our therapies could potentially serve following marketing approval, if and when received.
Commercial operations
We are building our commercialization organization in the United States, with a goal of delivering our gene therapies, if and once approved, to patients through qualified treatment centers. In the course of preparing to treat our first commercial patients, we have established commercial capabilities in the United States by adding employees with broad experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. Our commercialization activities include active engagements with stakeholders across the healthcare system, including those with public and private payers, patient advocates and organizations, professional societies, and healthcare providers, to explore new payment models that we hope will enable access for more patients. Ultimately, we intend to leverage our commercial infrastructure to support the potential for multiple product launches in the United States. 
While we have largely established the appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure necessary for supporting our complex supply chain and commercialization activities, we expect that we may make additional targeted investments as we continue our efforts to build our network of qualified treatment centers, establishing patient-focused programs, educating healthcare professionals, and securing reimbursement. 
The timing and conduct of our commercialization activities will be dependent upon regulatory interactions, marketing approvals if and when received for our therapies, and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. 
Pipeline activities and strategic collaborations
Our near-term research and development activities are focused on efforts to expand the potential impact of our existing ex vivo programs through reduced toxicity conditioning and HSC mobilization regimens, as well as manufacturing process improvements. Our long-term investments in research and development are focused on potential in vivo applications of LVV technology. We seek to build our pipeline by investing in our in vivo LVV platform as well as by advancing our direct injection preclinical candidates. 
Currently, our strategic collaborations include those with: 
•Magenta Therapeutics, Inc., to evaluate the utility of MGTA-145 in combination with plerixafor for mobilization and collection of stem cells in adults and adolescents with SCD, through a proof-of-concept clinical trial; and
•Forty Seven, Inc., a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc., to pursue clinical proof-of-concept for an antibody-based conditioning regimen in combination with our ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy platform.
Intellectual property 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products 
may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes, transgenes, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, genetically modified cells, processes to manufacture our lentivirus-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates. In connection with the wind down of our operations in Europe, we have decided to let the non-U.S. patents and patent applications that we own lapse by ceasing further prosecution of our pending ex-U.S. patent applications and not paying future maintenance fees for ex-U.S. patents when due. As of January 25, 2022, our patent portfolio includes the following:
•approximately 144 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively in-licensed from third parties, including 13 that are co-owned with MIT, related to LVVs and vector systems;
•approximately 40 patents or patent applications that we have non-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to LVVs and vector systems;
•approximately 154 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to LVV or drug product manufacturing and associated assays;
•approximately 7 patents or patent applications that we have non-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to LVV or drug product manufacturing and associated assays; and
•approximately 27 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to therapeutic cellular product candidates and assays.
Our objective is to continue to expand our U.S. portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product candidates manufacturing processes. Examples of the products and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below. See also “—License agreements.” From time to time, we also evaluate opportunities to sublicense our portfolio of patents and patent applications that we own or exclusively license, and we may enter into such licenses from time to time.
Beti-cel and lovo-cel
The beti-cel and lovo-cel programs include the following patent portfolios described below.

•RDF. The in-licensed patent portfolio from Research Development Foundation ("RDF") in part, contains patents and patent applications directed to aspects of our LVV that may be utilized to produce beti-cel and lovo-cel. As of January 25, 2022, we had an exclusive license (from RDF) to seven issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications related to our LVV platform. Corresponding foreign patents and patent applications related to our LVV platform include issued patents in Canada, Europe, and Israel. We expect the issued composition of matter patents to expire from 2022-2027 in the United States, and in 2022 in the rest of the world (excluding possible patent term extensions). Further, we expect composition of matter patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2022 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio other than composition of matter patents, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2022 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
•MIT/bluebird bio. This co-owned patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications directed to certain specific compositions of matter for lentiviral β-globin expression vectors. As of January 25, 2022, we co-owned four issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application, as well as corresponding foreign patents issued in Europe and Hong Kong. We expect the issued composition of matter patents to expire in 2023 (excluding possible patent term extensions). Further, we expect composition of matter patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the 
appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2023 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2023 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).

•Pasteur Institute. The Pasteur patent portfolio contains the patents and patent applications described above.
•RDF. The in-licensed RDF patent portfolio contains the patents and patent applications described above.
•SIRION. The in-licensed patent portfolio from SIRION Biotech GmbH ("SIRION") contains patents and patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing ex vivo gene therapy products with LVV. As of January 25, 2022, we had an exclusive license to two issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application and two corresponding foreign patent applications and 45 issued corresponding foreign patents. We expect the issued method patents to expire in 2033 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other composition of matter and methods patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other 
governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2033 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2033 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
•bluebird bio. Another component of the bluebird bio patent portfolio includes LVV and drug product manufacturing platforms and is potentially applicable across our programs. This portion of the portfolio contains patents and patent applications directed to improved methods for transfection and transduction of therapeutic cells. As of January 25, 2022, we owned three issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications and 30 corresponding foreign patent applications and 61 issued corresponding foreign patents. We expect the issued method patents to expire from 2032-2037 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect composition of matter and method patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2032-2037 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2032-2037 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
•2seventy bio. The 2seventy bio patent portfolios include LVV manufacturing platforms and improvements and are potentially applicable across our programs. As of January 25, 2022, we had a non-exclusive license to three patent families that include one pending U.S. patent application and four corresponding foreign patent applications, one pending PCT application, and one U.S. provisional patent application. We expect any composition of matter or methods patents, if issued from a corresponding nonprovisional application or national stage application, or corresponding foreign applications, if applicable, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2040-2042 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2040-2042 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License agreements
Inserm-Transfert
In May 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with Inserm-Transfert, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale, for use of certain patents and know-how related to the ABCD1 gene and 
corresponding protein, for use in the field of human ALD therapy. Inserm-Transfert is referred to herein as Inserm. The last patent in the Inserm licensed patent portfolio expired in February of 2016. 
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include eli-cel, we will be obligated to pay Inserm a percentage of net sales as a royalty for the longer of the life of any patents covering the product or 10 years from first commercial sale. This royalty is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Inserm are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits.
We are required to use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and introduce them into the commercial market as soon as practical, consistent with our reasonable business practices and judgment in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We have assumed certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on an annual basis.
We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach or in the event the other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed with prejudice within 120 days after filing. In addition, Inserm may terminate the license agreement in the event that we cannot prove within 60 days of written notice from Inserm that we have been diligent in developing the licensed products and introducing them into the commercial market.
Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the patent rights covered by the agreement or 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The license grant ceases in connection with any such termination. The longest-lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement expired in 2016.
Institut Pasteur
We have entered into a license with Institut Pasteur for certain patents relating to the use of DNA sequences, LVV and recombinant cells in the field of ex vivo gene therapy and CAR T cell-based therapy in a range of indications, excluding vaccinations. This agreement was amended twice in 2012, again in 2013 and most recently in 2015. The Institut Pasteur licensed patent portfolio includes two U.S. patents. The issued patents have statutory expiration dates in 2022 and 2023. The license is exclusive for products containing human and non-human LVV. Institut Pasteur retains the right, on behalf of itself, its licensees and research partners, to conduct research using the licensed intellectual property.
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For the first sublicense including a product targeting β-hemoglobinopathies (including β-thalassemia and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy), we must pay Institut Pasteur an additional payment of €3.0 million. If we receive any income (cash or non-cash) in connection with sublicenses for products targeting indications other than β-hemoglobinopathies (including β-thalassemia and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy), we must pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of such income varying from low single digits if the sublicense also includes licenses to intellectual property controlled by us, and a percentage of sublicense income in the mid-range double digits if the sublicense does not include licenses to intellectual property controlled by us.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel, lovo-cel, and eli-cel, we will be obligated to pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies depending on the indication of the product but in any event is in the low single digits. In addition, starting in 2016 we must make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which is creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. If the combined royalties we would be required to pay to Institut Pasteur and third parties is higher than a pre-specified percentage, we may ask Institut Pasteur to re-negotiate our royalty rates under this relationship.
We are required to use all reasonable commercial efforts (as compared to a company of similar size and scope) to develop and commercialize one or more products in the license field and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals in respect of, and market the products in license field, if any. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations. We must report on our progress towards achieving these milestones on an annual basis. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time by sending Institut Pasteur 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party’s substantial breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Institut Pasteur may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and not dismissed within 60 days.
Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the last licensed patents or five years after first market authorization of the first product, whichever occurs later. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain the right to manufacture, import, use and sell licensed products for a certain period of time post-termination. In addition, our ownership stake in certain jointly made improvements covered by the licensed patents would survive termination of the agreement. The longest-lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in 2023.
Stanford University
In July 2002, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, referred to herein as Stanford, which we amended and restated in April 2012. Under this agreement, we are granted a license to use the HEK293T cell line for any commercial or non-commercial use for research, nonclinical and clinical development purpose and human and animal gene therapy products.
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For each such sublicense we grant, we must pay Stanford a fee (unless the sublicense is to a collaborating partner, contract manufacturer or contract research organization).
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel, lovo-cel, and eli-cel, we will be obligated to pay Stanford a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies with net sales but in any event is in the low single digits and is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage which is less than one percent. Since April 2013, we have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments.
We may unilaterally terminate the agreement by giving Stanford 30 days’ written notice. Stanford may also terminate the license agreement if after 30 days of providing notice we are delinquent on any report or payment, are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize one or more licensed products, are in material breach of any provision or provide any false report. Termination of this agreement may require us to utilize different cell types for vector manufacturing, which could lead to delays.
Absent early termination, the license will expire in April 2037. We may elect to extend the term for an additional 25 years so long as we have a commercial product on the market at that time and we are in material compliance with the license agreement.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In December 1996, we entered into an exclusive license with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referred to herein as MIT, for use of certain patents in any field. This license agreement was amended in December 2003, May 2004 and June 2011. The licensed patent portfolio includes at least 13 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date from in 2023. This license also has been amended to include a case jointly owned by MIT and us wherein we received the exclusive license to MIT’s rights in this case. MIT retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for noncommercial research purposes.
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. In the event we sublicense the patent rights, we must pay MIT a percentage of all payments we receive from the sublicensee. This percentage varies from mid-single digits to low double digits.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel and lovo-cel, we will be obligated to pay MIT a percentage of net sales by us or our sublicensees as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one-percent. In addition, we make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which may be credited against the royalty payments.
We are required to use diligent efforts to market licensed products and to continue active, diligent development and marketing efforts for licensed products during the term of the agreement. We have assumed certain milestones with respect to raising capital investment and regulatory progress. We must report on our progress on achieving these milestones on an annual basis.
We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon six months’ notice to MIT. MIT may terminate the agreement if we cease to carry on our business, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment). In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain a right to complete manufacture of any licensed products in process and sell then-existing inventory. In addition, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license following such termination. With respect to jointly owned intellectual property, any termination would allow MIT to grant licenses to any third-party to such intellectual property, without our approval, unless a sublicensee was already in place, in which case, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license.
Research Development Foundation
In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license with RDF to use certain patents that involve LVV. The RDF licensed patent portfolio includes at least 31 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date between 2021 and 2027. RDF retains the right, on behalf of itself and other nonprofit academic research institutions, to practice and use the licensed patents for any academic, non-clinical research and educational purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel, lovo-cel, and eli-cel, we are obligated to pay RDF a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced by half if during the following ten years from the first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends.
We are required to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts for a company of our size and resources to develop or commercialize one or more licensed products, including our first licensed product by 2016 and a second licensed product by 2018. These diligence efforts include minimum annual royalty payments to RDF, which are creditable against earned royalties otherwise due to RDF, and payments upon regulatory milestones.
RDF may terminate the agreement in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment) or in the event we become bankrupt, our business or assets or property are placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, we institute or suffer to be instituted any procedure in bankruptcy court for reorganization or rearrangement of our financial affairs, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if we or an affiliate or a sublicensee institutes any procedure challenging the validity or patentability of any patent or patent application within the licensed patents, the agreement will immediately terminate.
Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until its expiration upon the later of there being no more valid claims within the licensed patents or the expiration of our royalty obligations on licensed products that are subject to an earned royalty, if such earned royalty is based on the minimum 10-year royalty period described above. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, RDF will grant our sublicensees a direct license. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are in one U.S. patent currently expected to expire in 2027.
SIRION
In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with SIRION, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of manufacturing gene therapy products. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date in 2033. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel and lovo-cel, we will be obligated to pay SIRION a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop one or more licensed products in the license field during the term of the agreement, and we must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $13.4 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to SIRION. SIRION may terminate the license in the event of our material breach upon notice and following an opportunity for us to cure the material breach. SIRION may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and are not dismissed within a specified period of time. Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the patent rights covered by the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the Agreement are currently expected to expire in 2033.
Orchard Therapeutics Limited
In April 2017, we entered into a license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited ("GSK") pursuant to which GSK non-exclusively licensed certain of our patent rights related to LVV technology to develop and commercialize gene therapies for Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy, two rare genetic diseases. Effective April 2018, this license agreement was assigned by GSK to Orchard Therapeutics Limited ("Orchard"). Financial terms of the agreement included an upfront payment to us as well as potential development and regulatory milestone payments and low single digit royalties on net sales of covered products.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of therapies and the commercialization of those therapies. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ therapies may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any therapy we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our therapies.
These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any therapies that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapies that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over current standard of care. Depending on how successful these competitive efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our therapies. These efforts include the following:
Sickle cell disease — The current standard of care for the treatment of SCD in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions or hydroxyurea (a generic drug). In addition, patients treated with chronic blood transfusions often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload. We are aware of ongoing studies that continue to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in various populations. In addition, a limited number of patients with SCD receive allogeneic HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. There are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the tolerability and safety of allogeneic HSCT with less well-matched sources of donor cells, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. received FDA approval for and has launched Endari (L-glutamine) for the treatment of SCD. In addition to the FDA approved HbS polymerization inhibitor (voxelotor, Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.) and the FDA / EMA approved antibody to p-selectin (crizanlizumab, Novartis), a number of different therapeutic approaches for the chronic treatment of SCD are under investigation targeting the various aspects of SCD pathophysiology, including: a pyruvate kinase receptor activator, mitapivat, being developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and being evaluated by the FDA with a New Drug Application under priority review; another pyruvate kinase receptor activator, FT-4202, in a Phase 1 study supported by Forma Therapeutics; a PDE9 inhibitor, IMR-687, in a Phase 2 study supported by IMARA Inc.; and a selective small molecule inhibitor of ectoderm development protein designed to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin, FTX-6058, in a phase 1 study supported by Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. There are also several different groups developing gene therapy options for sickle cell disease. These include: CRISPR Therapeutics AG’s (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) ongoing Phase 1/2 study for its CTX-001, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer, 
Aruvant Sciences, Inc.’s ongoing Phase 1/2 study for its ARU-1801, which leverages LVV encoding γ-globin, Editas Medicine, Inc.’s ongoing Phase 1/2 study for its EDIT-301, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing platform to target the HBG1/2 promoter to upregulate HbF, and Graphite Bio’s ongoing Phase 1/2 study for its GPH101, which leverages a gene correction platform (CRISPR / homology directed repair) to restore normal hemoglobin production. There are several other groups developing gene therapy approaches for SCD in early phases of development, including Beam Therapeutics, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Novartis), and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. 
β-thalassemia — The current standard of care for the treatment of β-thalassemia in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions to address the patient’s anemia. In addition, such patients often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload associated with their chronic blood transfusions. Novartis and Chiesi, who provide the leading iron chelation therapies, are seeking to develop improvements to their product profile and accessibility. A number of different approaches are under investigation that seek to improve the current standard of care treatment options, including a protein that aims to improve red blood cell production and small molecule that aims to improve red blood cell metabolism. Reblozyl (luspatercept), a subcutaneously-delivered protein therapeutic marketed by Acceleron Pharma, Inc. (recently acquired by Merck) and BMS that targets molecules in the TGF-β superfamily, has been approved in the United States for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular RBC transfusions, and was recently approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia associated with β-thalassemia. Additionally, Agios has announced that an application for Mitapivat, an oral pyruvate kinase receptor activator, has been accepted for filing and granted priority review by the FDA. Some patients with β-thalassemia receive HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. In addition, there are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT, or the tolerability and safety of haploidentical HSCT, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. There are also several different groups developing gene therapy options for β-thalassemia. These include: CRISPR Therapeutics AG (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) is conducting an ongoing Phase 1/2 study for its CTX-001, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer; and the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (in collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics) is currently investigating its gene therapy in a Phase 2 study of adults and pediatric patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia, although Orchard Therapeutics has announced that this program has been deprioritized as of May 2020.
CALD — The current standard of care for the treatment of CALD is allogeneic HSCT. We understand that various academic centers around the world are seeking to develop improvements to allogeneic HSCT, such as Magenta Therapeutic, Inc.’s cord blood expansion technology which is currently being investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of inherited metabolic disorders, including adrenoleukodystrophy. Other possible treatments being investigated include Orpheris, Inc.’s OP-101, Minoryx Therapeutics’ MIN-102 (leriglitazone), and Viking Therapeutics’ VK0214.
Government regulation
In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FD&C Act") and the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act") and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, purity, potency, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, record keeping, post-approval monitoring, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices ("GLPs"), and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial commences;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices ("GCPs") and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency or efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s good tissue practices ("GTPs") for the human cellular and tissue products;
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs, where applicable.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
In addition to the IND submission process, under the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”), supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. The biological product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage,to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. For example, the FDA recommends that sponsors of certain gene therapy clinical trials observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA") as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, 
and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products ("HCT/Ps") which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months, such as in the case of our BLAs for beti-cel and eli-cel upon FDA request, or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Regenerative medicine advanced therapies designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative medicine advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, 
or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Post-approval requirements
Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any future products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug or biological products or that hold approved BLAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly-discovered safety issue.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising and advertising to healthcare professionals, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. Consequences could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration 
Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act") signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Healthcare and Privacy Laws 
In addition to restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state/ federal laws and trade association membership codes of conduct have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include Anti-Kickback and false claims statutes. The U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging healthcare professionals or patients as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs.
The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or 
knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The U.S. federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to prescribers and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. A number of other countries, states and municipalities have also implemented additional payment tracking and reporting requirements, which if not done correctly may result in additional penalties.
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. In many other countries, healthcare professionals who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by government entities, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities. Our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In California the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing information. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these various healthcare and privacy laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government healthcare programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. Third-party payers can include government healthcare systems, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety, efficacy, and overall value. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
We have proposed novel payment models, including outcomes-based arrangements with payments over time, to assist with realizing the value and sharing the risk of a potential one-time treatment, such as for beti-cel. While we are engaged in discussions with potential payers, there is no assurance that these payment models will be widely adopted by payers. Even with these payment models, there may be substantial resistance to the cost of our products by payers and the public generally. These payment models may not be sufficient for payers to grant coverage, and if we are unable to obtain adequate coverage for our products, the adoption of our products and access for patients may be limited. In addition, to the extent reimbursement for our products is subject to outcomes-based arrangements, our future revenues from product sales will be more at risk. These factors could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
COVID-19
Beginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19") has evolved into a global pandemic. As a result, we continue to experience disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. We continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies at our location to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory or manufacturing facility, a work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel, and a phased approach to bringing personnel back to our location over time. Further, we are working with our clinical study sites to understand the duration and scope of the impact on enrollment, develop protocols to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other activities for our ongoing clinical studies. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2021 financial results.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Human capital
As of January 31, 2022, we had 518 full-time employees, 80 of whom have Ph.D., M.D. or Pharm.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 330 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 188 employees are engaged in commercial, finance, legal, business development, human resources, information technology, facilities and other general administrative functions. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Compensation and benefits programs
Our compensation programs are designed to align our employees' interests with the drivers of growth and stockholder returns by supporting the Company's achievement of its primary business goals. The Company's goal is to attract and retain employees whose talents, expertise, leadership, and contributions are expected to sustain growth and drive long-term stockholder value. Consequently, we provide employee wages that are competitive within our industry, and we engage a nationally-recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. We seek to align our employees' interests with those of stockholders by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the employee’s financial interests with the interests of stockholders. We are also committed to providing comprehensive 
benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. All employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) plan, and group life and disability coverage. 
Employee development and training
The development, recruitment and retention of our employees is a critical success factor for our company. To ensure we provide a meaningful experience for our employees, we regularly measure organizational culture and engagement, to build on the competencies that are important for our future success. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established programs to support the talent pipeline for critical roles throughout our organization, to help us identify, foster, and retain high performing employees. To empower our employees to realize their potential at bluebird, we provide a range of development programs, opportunities and resources they need to be successful, including leveraging formal leadership training and coaching to improve performance and retention, increase our organizational learning and support the promotion of our current employees.
