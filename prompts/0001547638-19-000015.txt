Item 1. | Business

The following discussion of our business provides information regarding our principal gathering, transportation, processing, NGL fractionation and other assets. For a discussion of our results of operations, please read Part II, Item 7 of this report.
General Overview
Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership," "Southcross," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2012. We are a master limited partnership, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that provides natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation services and access to NGL fractionation and transportation services. We also source, purchase, transport and sell natural gas and NGLs. Our assets are located in South Texas, Mississippi and Alabama and include two gas processing plants, one fractionation facility, one treating facility and gathering and transportation pipelines.
Southcross Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Holdings”) indirectly owns 100% of Southcross Energy Partners GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, our general partner (“General Partner”) (and therefore controls us), all of our subordinated and Class B convertible units (the "Class B Convertible Units") and currently owns 54.4% of our common units. Our General Partner owns an approximate 2.0% interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. EIG Global Energy Partners, LLC (“EIG”) and Tailwater Capital LLC (“Tailwater”) (collectively, the “Sponsors”) each indirectly own approximately one-third of Holdings, and a group of Holdings' former term loan lenders own the remaining one-third of Holdings.
Bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11
On April 1, 2019 (the "Petition Date"), the Partnership and certain of the Partnership's subsidiaries, including Southcross Energy Partners, L.P., our General Partner, Southcross Energy Finance Corp., Southcross Energy Operating, LLC, Southcross Energy GP LLC, Southcross Energy LP LLC, Southcross Gathering Ltd., Southcross CCNG Gathering Ltd., Southcross CCNG Transmission Ltd., Southcross Marketing Company Ltd., Southcross NGL Pipeline Ltd., Southcross Midstream Services, L.P., Southcross Mississippi Industrial Gas Sales, L.P., Southcross Mississippi Pipeline, L.P., Southcross Gulf Coast Transmission Ltd., Southcross Mississippi Gathering, L.P., Southcross Delta Pipeline LLC, Southcross Alabama Pipeline LLC, Southcross Nueces Pipelines LLC, Southcross Processing LLC, FL Rich Gas Services GP, LLC, FL Rich Gas Services, LP, FL Rich Gas Utility GP, LLC, FL Rich Gas Utility, LP, Southcross Transmission, LP, T2 EF Cogeneration Holdings, LLC, and T2 EF Cogeneration LLC (collectively the “Filing Subsidiaries” and, together with the Partnership and General Partner, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ have proposed to jointly administer their Chapter 11 cases under the caption In re Southcross Energy Partners, L.P., Case No. 19-10702 (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). We will continue to operate our businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors have filed with the Bankruptcy Court motions seeking a variety of first-day relief, which are designed primarily to minimize the impact of the Chapter 11 proceedings on our operations, customers and employees and includes a motion to obtain post-petition financing. We expect to continue our operations without interruption during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings.
For the duration of the of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to significant risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings. As a result of these significant risks and uncertainties, our assets, liabilities, unitholders’ equity (deficit), officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in these financial statements may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 proceedings. See further discussion of the Chapter 11 proceedings in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. 
Recent Developments
Delisting of Common Units from NYSE
On February 27, 2019, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) notified the Partnership that the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc. (the “NYSE Regulation”) had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common units. The NYSE Regulation reached its decision to delist our common units pursuant to Rule 802.01C of the NYSE’s Listed Company Manual, as the Partnership’s unit price had fallen below the NYSE’s continued listing standard with average closing price of less than 
6

$1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period and failed to cure this non-compliance within the required timeframe. The NYSE also suspended trading after the market close on the NYSE on February 27, 2019.
Effective February 28, 2019, our common units commenced trading on the OTCQX Marketplace under the ticker symbol "SXEE". On March 20, 2019, the NYSE filed with the SEC a notification of removal from listing and registration on Form 25 to delist our common units and terminate the registration of our common units under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The delisting became effective on April 1, 2019.
Holdings' Sale of Robstown Facility
On October 4, 2018, EPIC Midstream Holdings, LP (“EPIC”) and EPIC Y-Grade Holdings, LP, a subsidiary of EPIC ("EPIC Y-Grade"), entered into a definitive equity purchase agreement (the "Robstown Purchase Agreement") with Holdings and Holdings Borrower to acquire Holdings' Robstown fractionation facility ("Robstown") and related pipelines that enables Robstown to receive natural gas liquids from various supply sources and several short pipelines that allow the delivery of fractionated products to Corpus Christi-area markets. Under the terms of the agreement, EPIC assumed all of the NGL purchase and sale agreements associated with Robstown, including certain natural gas liquids sales and transportation agreements with the Partnership. The sale was completed in November 2018.
Management Changes
Effective September 17, 2018, the board of directors of our General Partner (the "Partnership GP Board") elected James W. Swent III as the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of our General Partner. Mr. Swent succeeded David W.

Our liquidity and ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants have been negatively impacted by our level of indebtedness. Despite our significant efforts to improve our financial condition, we have continued to face increasing liquidity concerns.
During 2017 and 2018, we focused on restructuring our balance sheet to improve our liquidity and financial condition.
On December 29, 2016, we entered into the fifth amendment (the "Fifth Amendment") to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo, N.A., UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Bank PLC and a syndicate of lenders (the "Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which, (i) the total aggregate commitments under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement were reduced from $200 million to $115 million and the sublimit for letters of credit was also reduced from $75 million to $50 million; (ii) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (each as defined in the Fifth Amendment) financial covenants were suspended until the quarter ending March 31, 2019; and (iii) the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) financial covenant requirement was reduced from 2.50 to 1.00 to 1.50 to 1.00 for all periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2018 (the “Ratio Compliance Date”). Prior to the Ratio Compliance Date, we were required to maintain minimum levels of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) on a quarterly basis and were subject to certain covenants and restrictions related to liquidity and capital expenditures. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
In connection with the execution of the Fifth Amendment, on December 29, 2016, the Partnership entered into (i) an Investment Agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with Holdings and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (ii) a Backstop Agreement (the "Backstop Agreement") with Holdings, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and the Sponsors and (iii) a First Amendment to Equity Cure Contribution Agreement (the "Equity Cure Contribution Amendment") with Holdings. Pursuant to the Equity Cure Contribution Amendment, on December 29, 2016, Holdings contributed $17.0 million to us in exchange for 11,486,486 common units. The proceeds of the $17.0 million contribution were used to pay down the outstanding balance under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. In addition, on January 2, 2018, we notified Holdings that a Full Investment Trigger (as defined in the Investment Agreement) occurred on December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, on January 2, 2018, Holdings delivered a Backstop Demand (as defined in the Investment Agreement) for each Sponsor to fund their respective pro rata portions of the Sponsor Shortfall Amount (as defined in the Investment Agreement) of $15.0 million in accordance with the Backstop Agreement. As consideration for the amount provided directly to us by the Sponsors pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, we issued to the Sponsors senior unsecured notes of the Partnership in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million (each, an "Investment Note" and collectively, the “Investment Notes”). The Investment Notes mature on November 5, 2019 and bear interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum. Interest on the Investment Notes shall be paid in kind (other than with respect to interest payable (i) on or after the maturity date, (ii) in connection with prepayment, or (iii) upon acceleration of the Investment Note, which shall be payable in cash); provided that all interest shall be payable in cash on or after December 31, 2018. The Investment Notes are the unsecured obligation of the Partnership subordinate in right of payment to any of our secured obligations under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, UBS Securities LLC and Barclays Bank PLC and a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan Agreement” and, together with the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement, the “Senior Credit Facilities”).
On July 29, 2018, we terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 31, 2017, by and among us, our General Partner, American Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“AMID”), American Midstream GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of AMID (“AMID GP”), and Cherokee Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMID (“Merger Sub”) as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Merger Agreement, dated as of June 1, 2018, by and among us, our General Partner, AMID, AMID GP and Merger Sub (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), since the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement was not completed on or prior to June 15, 2018. As previously disclosed, under the Merger Agreement, we were to merge with and into Merger Sub, with the Partnership surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID.
On August 10, 2018, we entered into the sixth amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement which, among other things, reduced the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio from 1.50 to 1.00 to 1.25 to 1.00 for the period ending on June 30, 2018. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
During management's ongoing assessment of the Partnership's financial forecast, the board of directors of Southcross Holdings GP, LLC (the “Holdings GP Board”) and the board of directors of our General Partner (the “Partnership GP Board”), together with our management, determined that in the then current corporate capital structure and absent continued access to equity cures from our Sponsors or a significant equity infusion from a third party, or absent additional amendments to its Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement (which matures on August 4, 2019) or waivers of the March 31, 2019 requirement to comply with the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and minimum Adjusted EBITDA (both as defined in the Fifth Amendment) and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Sixth Amendment), the Partnership was not expected to be able to comply with such financial covenants, which would have triggered an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities. As a 
8

result of the Partnership’s expected inability to comply with its financial covenants within the twelve months from the issuance of this Annual Form 10-K, together with the maturity date of the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement being in less than twelve months, management determined that there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In March 2019, in light of (a) the August 4, 2019 maturity of the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement, (b) the impending non-compliance with our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, minimum Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (each as defined in the Fifth Amendment - see Note 2 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements) at March 31, 2019 that would result in an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities, (c) our non-compliance with our minimum Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio as of December 31, 2018 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements); and (d) the inclusion of a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph in the audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements, which constitutes an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities, we elected not to make the approximately $7.4 million interest payment on our Term Loan that was due on March 29, 2019. While we have been in discussions with our creditors, those discussions did not produce an agreement that would enable us to address effectively, in a holistic manner, the impending issues adversely impacting our business, including (i) impending maturity of the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) current and potential near-term breaches of certain financial covenants, and (iii) certain other potential defaults under our Senior Credit Facilities.
Despite our efforts to improve our financial condition, we continued to face increasing liquidity concerns. As of March 20, 2019, our liquidity was $2.1 million. On April 1, 2019, the Partnership and the Filing Subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We were not able to reach an agreement with our creditors for a plan of reorganization prior to the Petition Date. Therefore, the outcome of our Chapter 11 process is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including actions of the Court and our creditors.
On April 1, 2019, we filed a motion seeking entry of an order authorizing the Debtors to enter into the Debtor-in-Possession financing (“DIP Financing”) to, among other things, provide additional liquidity to fund our operations during the Chapter 11 process.
Pursuant to a Commitment Letter dated as of March 31, 2019 and Form Credit Agreement attached thereto (the “DIP Credit Agreement” and, the facility thereunder, the “DIP Facility”), to be entered into by Southcross, as borrower, its direct and indirect Debtor subsidiaries, as guarantors (the “Guarantors” and, together with Southcross, the “Loan Parties”), certain of our creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities, as lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) and letter of credit issuers (the “DIP L/C Issuers”), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent (the “DIP Agent”), the DIP Lenders have agreed to provide to the Loan Parties the DIP Financing in an aggregate principal amount of $255 million, consisting of (i) a senior secured priming superpriority term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $72.5 million (the “DIP New Money Loan”), (ii) a senior secured priming superpriority term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $55 million (the “DIP LC Loan” and, together with the DIP New Money Loans, the “DIP Term Loans”) to cash collateralize a letter of credit sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit by certain issuing banks that will be party to the DIP Credit Agreement (the “DIP L/C Facility”), and (iii) a senior secured priming superpriority term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $127.5 million, which will be subject and subordinate to the DIP New Money Facility and the DIP L/C Facility, to refinance dollar-for-dollar term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement owed to the DIP Lenders (the “DIP Roll-Up Loan” and, together with the DIP Term Loans, the “DIP Loans”). The DIP Loans are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. The proceeds of the DIP Loans will be used for purposes permitted by the Bankruptcy Court and the DIP Credit Agreement, including (i) working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Loan Parties, including the refinancing of certain term loans and letters of credit, (ii) to pay transaction costs, professional fees, and other obligations and expenses incurred in connection with the DIP Facilities, the Chapter 11 Cases, and the transactions contemplated thereunder, and (iii) to make adequate protection payments to Southcross’s creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities to the extent set forth in any order entered by the Bankruptcy Court.
The DIP Facilities will mature on the earliest of (i) the date that is six months after the Petition Date (subject to one three month extension with the consent of the DIP Lenders constituting the required lenders under the DIP Facility), (ii) the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan, (iii) the date on which all or substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties are sold in a sale under a Chapter 11 plan or pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iv) the date the DIP Facilities are accelerated following an event of default thereunder.  Subject to certain exceptions, the DIP Facility will be secured by a senior perfected security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties, including the collateral securing the Senior Credit Facilities and any other previously unencumbered assets.

We continue to engage in discussions with our creditors regarding the terms of a financial restructuring plan. In conjunction with the Chapter 11 process, we will explore potential strategic alternatives to maximize value for the benefit of our stakeholders, which may include a sale of certain or substantially all of our assets under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or a plan of reorganization to equitize certain indebtedness as an alternative to the sale process.

Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following are our competitive strengths:

• | Strategically located asset base. The majority of our assets are located in, or within close proximity to, the Eagle Ford Shale region in South Texas, which is one of the most resource-rich drilling regions in the U.S. We operate in Mississippi and Alabama. We also believe that the potential of our South Texas assets coupled with the established, long-lived nature of our Mississippi and Alabama assets provide us with the opportunity to generate sustainability over the next several years. In addition, all of our assets have access to major natural gas market areas. 


• | South Texas. Our growth opportunities are impacted primarily by natural gas production in the Eagle Ford Shale region. Our Eagle Ford Southcross pipeline catchment area includes multiple prospective production zones, including the Olmos tight sands formation, which overlays the Eagle Ford Shale. Our business activity provides us with relationships with producers in the South Texas region and an understanding of their future development plans and infrastructure needs. In addition, our South Texas systems benefit from access to the large industrial market for both natural gas and NGLs in and around the Corpus Christi area. 


• | Mississippi and Alabama. We are a leading service provider in the Mississippi and Alabama regions in which we operate. Our assets provide critical supply to our industrial, commercial and power generation customers and the wholesale markets via intrastate and interstate pipeline interconnects. Several of the large, gas-fired power plants across the southern portion of Mississippi access their primary source of natural gas through our system. 


• | Reliable cash flows underpinned by long-term, fixed-fee and fixed-spread contracts. We provide our services primarily under fixed-fee and fixed-spread contracts, which help to promote cash flow reliability and minimize our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. 


• | Integrated South Texas midstream value chain. We provide a comprehensive package of services to natural gas producers and customers including natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation and access to NGL fractionation and transportation services. We believe our ability to move natural gas and NGLs from the wellhead to market provides us with several advantages in competing for new supplies of natural gas. Specifically, the integrated nature of our business allows us to provide multiple services related to a single supply of natural gas and take advantage of incremental opportunities that present themselves along the value chain. Providing multiple services to customers also gives us a better understanding of each customer's needs and the marketplace. In addition to the advantages with our producers and customers, our ability to source and transport natural gas to market also allows us to satisfy our commercial and industrial customers' demand for natural gas. We believe all of these factors provide a competitive advantage relative to companies which do not offer this range of midstream services. 


• | Experienced management and operating teams. Our senior executives have worked in several energy companies. Our executive officers have extensive experience in building, acquiring and managing midstream and other energy assets and are focused on optimizing our existing business. Many of our field operating managers and supervisors have long-standing experience operating our assets. 


• | Sponsors with significant industry expertise. Our Sponsors are the principal owners of Holdings, which is the owner of our General Partner and the indirect beneficial owner of 54.4% of our common units, and have substantial experience as private equity investors in the energy and midstream sectors. Our Sponsors' investment professionals have deep experience in identifying, evaluating, negotiating and financing acquisitions and investments in the midstream sector. We believe that our Sponsors provide us with strategic guidance and financial expertise that enhance our ability to grow our asset base and cash flow. 

Our Assets and Operations
Our assets consist of gathering systems, intrastate pipelines, two natural gas processing plants, one fractionation facility, 20 compressor stations and a treating system. Our operations are managed as and presented in one reportable segment.

(1) | During the second quarter of 2017, in an effort to further our cost-saving initiatives, management elected to idle the Bonnie View fractionation facility (“Bonnie View”). As a result, all of our Y-grade product was being sold to Holdings in accordance with our affiliate Y-grade sales agreement and was being fractionated at Robstown. However, during the fourth quarter of 2018, Holdings completed the sale of Robstown to EPIC. Under the terms of the Robstown Purchase Agreement, EPIC assumed all of the NGL purchase and sale agreements associated with Robstown, including those with the Partnership through December 31, 2019, as described above. As a result of the Robstown sale, Bonnie View will continue to serve as a backup option for EPIC to the extent Robstown is unable to fractionate our Y-grade product. In addition, EPIC has the option to request the Partnership to restart Bonnie View for the benefit of EPIC through December 31, 2019. At this time, we have no plans to restart Bonnie View and we will continue to operate the facility as a truck unloading facility and pipeline Y-grade receipt point.

We own equity interests in two joint ventures in South Texas with a subsidiary of Targa Resources Corp. ("Targa") as our joint venture partner. These two joint ventures, T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company LLC (“T2 Eagle Ford”) and T2 LaSalle 
11

Gathering Company LLC (“T2 LaSalle”), operate natural gas pipelines. Prior to December 31, 2018, we owned a third joint venture with Targa, T2 EF Cogeneration Holdings LLC (“T2 Cogen”), which operates an electric cogeneration facility. We indirectly own a 50% interest in T2 Eagle Ford and a 25% interest in T2 La Salle, and prior to December 31, 2018, we indirectly owned a 50% interest in T2 Cogen. 
We previously had a joint venture arrangement with T2 Cogen which operated a cogeneration facility next to our Lone Star plant with similar terms that we accounted for as an equity method investment. On December 31, 2018, Targa and the Partnership, as part of a settlement of previous disputes, agreed to terminate the T2 Cogen joint venture and distributed one cogeneration unit to Targa, while the Partnership received 100% interest in T2 Cogen. Therefore, as of the effective date of December 31, 2018, T2 Cogen was no longer accounted for as an equity method investment and was consolidated into the Partnership. In addition, under the terms of the settlement, T2 Eagle Ford and T2 LaSalle will now operate under the direction of Targa after the completion of a transition period. Our indirect ownership percentages will remain the same with respect to T2 Eagle Ford and T2 LaSalle, and therefore continue to be accounted for as equity method investments. The following table provides information regarding our pipeline joint venture investments, T2 Eagle Ford and T2 LaSalle, for the year ended December 31, 2018:

 | As of December 31, 2018
Joint venture pipelines | Miles | Leased Capacity | | Average throughput volumes of natural gas (MMcf/d)
Dimmit | 49 | | 50 | % | 20 
LaSalle | 63 | | 25 | % | 111
Choke Canyon | 72 | | 50 | % | 137
Residue Header | 76 | | 50 | % | 226
Total | 260 | | | 

We derive revenue primarily from fixed-fee and fixed-spread arrangements. Our contracts vary in duration from one month to several years and the duration and pricing of our contracts vary depending upon several factors, including our competitive position, our acceptance of risks associated with longer-term contracts, and our desire to recoup over the term of a contract any capital expenditures that we are required to incur in order to provide service to our customers.
We continually seek new sources of natural gas supply and end use markets to increase the gas throughput volume on our gathering and pipeline systems and through our processing plants and compression assets.
The NGL products we produce have a variety of applications, including as heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. Our NGL products and the demand for these products are affected as follows: 

• | Ethane. Ethane is typically supplied as purity ethane or as part of an ethane-propane mix. Ethane is used primarily in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Although ethane typically is extracted as part of the mixed NGL stream at gas processing plants, if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to NGL product prices or if the demand for ethylene falls, it may be more profitable for natural gas processors to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream thereby reducing the volume of NGLs delivered for fractionation and marketing. 


• | Propane. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a heating, engine and industrial fuel, and in agricultural applications such as crop drying. Changes in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for propane. In addition, U.S. demand for propane as a heating fuel is affected significantly by weather conditions. The volume of propane sold in the U.S. typically is at its highest during the six-month peak heating season of October through March. Demand for propane may be reduced during periods of warmer-than-normal weather.


• | Normal Butane. Normal butane is used in the production of isobutane, as a refined product blending component, as a fuel gas and in the production of ethylene and propylene. U.S. demand for normal butane as a refined product blending component is at its highest in September through February. Changes in the composition of refined products resulting from governmental regulation, changes in feedstocks, products and economics, demand for heating fuel and for ethylene and propylene could affect demand for normal butane adversely.

12


• | Isobutane. Isobutane is used predominantly in refineries to produce alkylates to enhance octane levels. Accordingly, any action that reduces demand for motor gasoline or demand for isobutane to produce alkylates for octane enhancement could reduce demand for isobutane.


• | Natural Gasoline. Natural gasoline is used as a blending component for certain refined products and as a feedstock used in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the mandated composition resulting from governmental regulation of motor gasoline and in demand for ethylene and propylene could affect demand for natural gasoline adversely.

NGLs and products produced from NGLs also compete with global markets. Any reduced demand for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets we access for any of the reasons stated above could adversely affect demand for the services we provide as well as NGL prices, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
South Texas
The assets in our South Texas region are located between Webb and Dimmit Counties near the Texas-Mexico border. As of December 31, 2018, these assets consisted of approximately 2,019 miles of pipeline ranging in diameter from 2 to 24 inches, our Woodsboro processing plant, our Bonnie View NGL fractionation facility, our Lone Star processing plant, our Valley Wells System and 20 compression stations.
The majority of our pipelines in South Texas feed from multiple producing fields, including the Eagle Ford Shale, to our processing and NGL fractionation facilities at Lone Star, Woodsboro and Bonnie View. The residue gas pipelines from our processing plants and the remaining pipelines in lean gas service in South Texas are used to serve multiple industrial and electric generation customers, and to deliver gas to a number of intrastate and interstate pipelines. Holdings owns approximately 720 miles of pipeline, most of which is in Frio and LaSalle counties.
Our Woodsboro processing plant is a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant located in Refugio County, Texas. Our Bonnie View NGL fractionation plant, also in Refugio County, Texas, has a capacity of 22,500 Bbls/d. In June 2015, we completed the NGL pipelines, which include a Y-grade pipeline that connects our Woodsboro processing facility to Robstown, which is now owned by EPIC (as noted above in Recent Developments), and a propane pipeline from our Bonnie View fractionator to Robstown. The installation of the NGL pipelines resulted in our ability to sell incremental Y-grade to Holdings, and now EPIC, and mitigated the financial impact of the capacity reductions at Bonnie View. However, as a result of the completion of the Robstown sale, EPIC assumed all of the NGL purchase and sale agreements associated with Robstown, including those with the Partnership through December 31, 2019. Bonnie View will continue to serve as a backup option for EPIC to the extent Robstown is unable to fractionate our Y-grade product. In addition, EPIC has the option to request that the Partnership restart Bonnie View for the benefit of EPIC through December 31, 2019. At this time, we have no plans to restart Bonnie View and we will continue to operate the facility as a truck unloading facility and pipeline Y-grade receipt point. 
Our Lone Star processing plant is a 300 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant located in Bee County, Texas, and was acquired from TexStar Midstream Services, LP in August 2014. The plant is interconnected with other South Texas rich gas supply basins and Woodsboro via our Bee Line pipeline which was placed into service in 2013. 
Our Valley Wells System, located in LaSalle County, Texas, has sour gas treating capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d and is supported by a 60 MMcf/d minimum volume commitment from Holdings for gathering and treating services, while Holdings has producer contracts with minimum volume commitments totaling 35 MMcf/d behind the system. The system is connected to our rich gas system for transport and processing.
Our Gregory cryogenic processing plant ("Gregory") was a cryogenic processing plant that we shut down in December 2016 and converted into a compressor station. The natural gas that previously was sent to Gregory was diverted to our newer, more efficient, Woodsboro plant. 
Our Conroe processing plant and gathering system ("Conroe") was a 50 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas plant that operated together to gather and process natural gas. Conroe was shut down in December 2016 and was dismantled as of December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold $2.1 million of the assets associated with Conroe and Gregory. As a result, we recorded an impairment of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to adjust the carrying value of these assets to fair-value.
Mississippi and Alabama
The assets in our Mississippi region are located principally in the southern half of the state and comprise the largest intrastate pipeline system in Mississippi. The Mississippi assets consist of approximately 582 miles of pipeline, ranging in 
13

diameter from 2 to 20 inches with an estimated design capacity of 345 MMcf/d, and two treating plants. Our system throughput volumes in Mississippi are affected by both on-system gas production volumes and customers' demand for gas. The system has the capability to receive natural gas from three unaffiliated interstate pipelines—Southeast Supply Header, Southern Natural Gas Company and Texas Eastern Company—to supplement supply on the system or to market gas off the system.
The assets in our Alabama region are located in northwest and central Alabama and consist of 490 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines ranging from 2 to 16 inches in diameter with an estimated design capacity of 375 MMcf/d. The primary gas supply to the system is coal bed methane gas from the Black Warrior Basin with incremental volumes gathered from conventional gas wells. The system receives natural gas from unaffiliated interstate pipelines and services markets along the system.
Competition
The natural gas gathering, compression, processing, transportation and marketing business and the NGL fractionation business are highly competitive. Our competitors include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for natural gas volumes is based primarily on commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access to markets, location, available capacity, connection costs and fuel efficiencies. Our principal competitors are DCP Midstream LLC, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., Enterprise Products Partners LP, Kinder Morgan Inc. and Targa Resources Corp.
In addition to competing for natural gas supply volumes, we face competition for customer markets in selling residue gas and NGLs. Competition is based primarily on the proximity of pipelines to the markets, price and assurance of supply.
Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk
Our markets are in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi and we have a concentration of trade accounts receivable due from customers engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas and NGL products, and other services. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk as these customers may be affected similarly by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. We analyze customers' historical financial and operational information prior to extending credit.
Our top ten customers accounted for 40.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Due to the continued volatility of commodity prices, some of our customers may experience material financial and liquidity issues. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not experience significant nonpayment for services. We had no allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable at December 31, 2018. 
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (the "NGPSA"), and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the "PSIA"), which was reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in "high-consequence areas". PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in "high consequence areas," such as high population areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the "2011 Pipeline Safety Act"), reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016, signed on June 22, 2016, provides funding for the continuation of pipeline safety program revisions initiated under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and requires PHMSA to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, authorizes emergency order authority, designates marine coastal areas as unusually environmentally sensitive to pipeline failures and requires additional safety studies that could result in new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines.
PHMSA issued a separate rule effective on March 24, 2017 that imposes pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operators. PHMSA also published an advisory bulletin in 2012 providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure. We have performed hydrotests of our facilities to establish the maximum allowable operating pressure and do not expect that any final rulemaking by PHMSA regarding verification of maximum allowable operating pressure would materially affect our operations or revenue. We believe our records relating to allowable maximum operating pressure to be reliable, traceable, verifiable and complete.
14

In regulations published November 20, 2018, PHMSA revised its pipeline safety rules governing plastic piping systems. These rules increase design factors, increase maximum pressure and diameter for certain types of pipe and components, and establish new standards for risers, among other changes. The requirements apply to new, repaired and replaced pipelines. We do not believe that compliance with these new regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Additionally, the National Transportation Safety Board from time to time has recommended that the PHMSA make changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. While we cannot predict the outcome of proposed legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. Further legislative and regulatory changes may also result in higher penalties for the violation of federal pipeline safety regulations. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time the terms of any new laws or rules or the costs of compliance associated with such requirements, but we regularly inspect our pipelines and third parties assist us in interpreting the results of the inspections.
States largely are preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most states are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the "DOT") to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas and natural gas products pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
In addition, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (the "OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry; the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens; the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals; the Environmental Protection Agency's (the “EPA”) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, also known as the Risk Management Plan requirements, which are designed to prevent the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials; and the Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.
Further, exposure to gas containing certain levels of hydrogen sulfide, referred to as sour gas, can be harmful, even fatal, to humans. Some of the gas processed at our sour gas treating and processing facility, as part of the Valley Wells System, contains high levels of hydrogen sulfide. We do not believe that compliance with the applicable federal and state environmental, health and safety laws relating to these and other issues will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.
Regulation of Operations
Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas sales and transportation of NGLs may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.
Intrastate Pipelines
Our transmission lines are subject to state regulation of rates and terms of service. In Texas, the regulatory system allows rates to be negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis and are subject to a complaint-based review process. In rare circumstances, as allowed by statute, regulators may initiate a rate review. Although Texas does not have an "open access" requirement, there is a "non-discriminatory access" requirement, which is subject to a complaint-based review. In Mississippi and Alabama, the regulatory systems allow special contracts that are negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis for approval by the applicable state commission.
Section 311 Pipelines
Intrastate transportation of natural gas is largely regulated by the state in which such transportation takes place. Several of our intrastate pipeline subsidiaries, Southcross CCNG Transmission Ltd., Southcross Gulf Coast Transmission Ltd., Southcross 
15

Mississippi Pipeline, L.P., Southcross Transmission, LP, Southcross Nueces Pipelines LLC and Southcross Alabama Pipeline LLC, also provide certain interstate transportation services. The rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ("NGPA"), and Part 284 of FERC's regulations. Pipelines providing certain transportation service under Section 311 are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline or a local distribution company or LDC served by an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311, rates charged for intrastate transportation must be "fair and equitable", and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The rates under Section 311 approved by FERC are maximum and minimum rates and we may negotiate discounts at or below such maximum rates (but above the minimum rates) depending on the market. Currently, FERC reviews our rates every five years and such rates may increase or decrease as a result of such reviews. On February 1, 2019, in FERC Docket No. PR 19-35-000, Southcross Mississippi Pipeline, L.P. filed a petition for rate approval and amended statement of operating conditions in accordance with the required rate review. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate pipeline's statement of operating conditions are also subject to FERC's review and approval. In the future, should FERC determine not to authorize rates which fully recover our costs of service, our business may be adversely affected. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by FERC for Section 311 service, and/or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline's FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in alteration of jurisdictional status, and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies or sanctions.
Hinshaw Pipelines
Similar to intrastate pipelines, Hinshaw pipelines, by definition, also operate within a single state. We have a Mississippi pipeline segment that is categorized as a Hinshaw pipeline. Also, similar to pipelines operating under Section 311 of the NGPA, Hinshaw pipelines can receive gas that originates from outside their state without becoming subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"). Specifically, Section 1(c) of the NGA exempts from FERC's NGA jurisdiction those pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce if (1) they receive natural gas at or within the boundary of a state, (2) all the gas is consumed within that state and (3) the pipeline is regulated by a state commission. Following the enactment of the NGPA, FERC issued Order No. 63 authorizing Hinshaw pipelines to apply for authorization to transport natural gas in interstate commerce in the same manner as intrastate pipelines operating pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Hinshaw pipelines frequently operate pursuant to blanket certificates to provide transportation and sales service under FERC's regulations.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC. Although FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of our facilities we believe to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. In recent years, FERC has taken a more light-handed approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies, which has resulted in a number of such companies transferring gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. As a result of these activities, natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels. Our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Our natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Our natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. The states in which we operate have adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering 
16

access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there have been no adverse effects to our systems due to these regulations.
Market Behavior Rules; Reporting Requirements
Interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by FERC are required to comply with numerous regulations related to standards of conduct, market transparency, and market manipulation. FERC’s standards of conduct regulate the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates. FERC’s market oversight and transparency regulations require regulated entities to submit reports of, among other things, threshold purchases or sales of natural gas and publicly post certain information on scheduled volumes. FERC’s market manipulation regulations, promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes up to $1.0 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. The maximum penalty authority established by the statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
State Utility Regulation
Some of our operations in Texas are specifically subject to the Texas Gas Utility Regulatory Act, as implemented by the Railroad Commission of Texas ("RRC"). Generally, the RRC has authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales or transportation services are just and reasonable. Our gas utilities, Southcross CCNG Gathering Ltd., Southcross CCNG Transmission Ltd. and Southcross Gulf Coast Transmission Ltd., Southcross Nueces Pipelines LLC, FL Rich Gas Utility and Southcross Transmission, LP are required to file gas tariffs and Southcross NGL Pipeline Ltd. has filed NGL tariffs with the RRC.
In Mississippi, the Mississippi Public Service Commission considers Southcross Mississippi Industrial Gas Sales, L.P. a utility and it is necessary to get contract approval for negotiated contracts.
In Alabama, the Alabama Public Service Commission ("APSC") requires a gas utility to file "special negotiated contracts" with the APSC for approval, which includes our Southcross Alabama Pipeline LLC.
Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs
The transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated by FERC under the NGA, the NGPA and regulations issued under those statutes and the transportation of NGLs in interstate commerce is regulated by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. Historically the price, terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas at wholesale in interstate commerce was regulated by FERC, but the sale of NGLs was not regulated. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
The price at which we sell natural gas is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Sales of NGLs are currently not regulated and are made at negotiated prices. While sales by producers of natural gas and sales of NGLs can currently be made at market prices, Congress could enact price controls in the future.
As discussed above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation of natural gas and those initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas both directly and indirectly.
Anti-terrorism Measures
17

The Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2007 requires the Department of Homeland Security (the "DHS") to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present "high levels of security risk." The DHS issued an interim final rule in April 2007 regarding risk-based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and, on November 20, 2007, further issued an Appendix A to the interim rules that establishes chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with these interim rules. On July 20, 2016, DHS published a Final Rule outlining DHS’s tiering methodology to incorporate relevant elements of risk used to identify high risk facilities. Covered facilities that are determined by DHS to pose a high level of security risk are required to prepare and submit Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans as well as comply with other regulatory requirements, including those regarding inspections, audits, record-keeping and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information. Two of our facilities (the Gregory and Woodsboro plants) have more than the threshold quantity of listed chemicals; therefore, a "Top Screen" evaluation was submitted to the DHS. The DHS reviewed this information and determined that none of the facilities are considered high-risk chemical facilities.
Cyber Security Measures
While we are currently not subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standards are being considered in the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the DHS, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. Currently, we are implementing our own cyber security programs and protocols; however, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on our operations and those of our customers.
Environmental Matters
General
Our operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation, and for NGL fractionation and transportation services is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate or imposing additional costs on our operations;


• | managing or otherwise regulating the way we handle and secure toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials to prevent or minimize the release of such materials;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former or third-party operations; and


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or permit requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and pursuit of injunctive relief. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other materials into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and, thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations.
18

We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to interrupt or diminish, in any material way, our operational ability to gather, process, treat, compress and transport natural gas and fractionate and transport NGLs. We cannot provide assurance, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws, regulations, or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, release and disposal of hazardous substances and solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where these materials may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or the "Superfund Law"), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to cleanup sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.

We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the "RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate little hazardous waste; however, it is possible that certain non-hazardous waste, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. Moreover, from time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our operations or those of our customers.
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
Oil Pollution Act
In 1991, the EPA adopted regulations under the Oil Pollution Act (the "OPA"). These oil pollution prevention regulations, as amended several times since their original adoption, require the preparation of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure ("SPCC") plan for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility's operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility's SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security, and training. Most importantly, the facility must fully implement the SPCC plan and train personnel in its execution. We believe that none of our facilities is materially adversely affected by such requirements.
Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (the "CAA"), and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various emission sources, including our compressor stations and processing plants, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational 
19

limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. We and our customers may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We believe, however, that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements.
On January 30, 2013, the EPA finalized amendments to new regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from stationary internal combustion engines. The scope of applicability for most of our engines is the requirement to follow a prescribed maintenance plan or comply with already existing New Source Performance Standard. Although this rule has been the subject of litigation and has been and in the future may be revised, we do not anticipate that the revisions will have a material adverse effect on our operations. The few engines we do have that are subject to the control and compliance provisions of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Standard are new engines which meet the emissions limitations therein.
On April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. This rule addresses emissions of various pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. For new or reworked hydraulically-fractured gas wells, the final rule requires controlling emissions through flaring until 2015, when the rule requires the use of reduced emission, or "green", completions. The rule also established specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment. On August 5, 2013, the EPA finalized updates to the 2012 performance standards for emissions of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from storage tanks used in oil and natural gas production and transmission, which, among other things, adjusted reporting requirements and phased in the date by which storage tanks must install VOC controls. On June 3, 2016, the EPA published additional regulations to control emissions of methane and VOCs from various oil and natural gas operations, although on June 16, 2017, the EPA proposed to stay for two years certain requirements in the final rule including those relating to fugitive emissions requirements, well site pneumatic pump requirements, and requirements for certification of closed vent systems by a professional engineer. Both the stay and the underlying rules have been the subject of litigation. In September 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2016 rules, which, according to the EPA, are intended to “streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements, and significantly decrease unnecessary burdens on domestic energy producers.” ‎Future implementation of these standards is uncertain at this time. Compliance with the 2016 rules, if they are not stayed or significantly revised pursuant to EPA’s 2018 proposal, could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the "Clean Water Act"), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the U.S. and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. In May 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that attempts to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the U.S., but this rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In June 2017, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule to rescind the May 2015 rule, and re-codify the regulatory test that existed prior to 2015 regarding the definition of “Waters of the United States.” Thereafter, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years. On December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed a new rule defining a narrower reach of the CWA’s jurisdiction. Given the nationwide patchwork of litigation and court rulings that have developed regarding the rules, the 2015 rule is effective in some states, while the agencies’ decision to delay implementation of the 2015 rule is effective in other states. If finalized, the 2018 proposed rule would apply nationwide, replacing the national patchwork of CWA jurisdictional applicability. Additionally, if finalized, it is possible that the 2018 proposed rule could be challenged. The scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction will likely remain fluid until a final regulatory determination is made and subsequent litigation, if any, is finalized. To the extent a rule ultimately promulgated or established, like the May 2015 rule, expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to permitting for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with 
20

foreseeable new permit requirements under the Clean Water Act and state counterparts will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (the "ESA") restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. The current listing of species as threatened or endangered has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in the affected areas.
Climate Change
The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions which does not currently apply to our facilities. In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from certain large GHG emissions sources. Our Gregory, Woodsboro, Bonnie View, Lone Star and El Dorado facilities are or will be required to report under this rule. This reporting rule was expanded in November 2010 to include petroleum and natural gas facilities, including certain natural gas transmission compression facilities, and again in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. We have submitted the reports required under the reporting rule on a timely basis and have adopted procedures for future required reporting. In addition, on June 3, 2016, the EPA issued published regulations to control emissions of methane, a GHG, and VOCs from various oil and natural gas operations, although on June 16, 2017, the EPA proposed to stay for 2 years certain requirements in the final rule. Both the stay and the underlying rules have been the subject of litigation. In September 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2016 rules, which, according to the EPA, are intended to “streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements, and significantly decrease unnecessary burdens on domestic energy producers.” ‎Future implementation of these standards is uncertain at this time. Compliance with the 2016 rules, if they are not stayed, or significantly revised pursuant to EPA’s 2018 proposal, could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Several states have implemented programs to reduce and/or monitor GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, including our current or future customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services.
In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce GHG emissions (the “Paris Agreement”). On June 1, 2017, however, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement unless it could re-enter on more favorable terms. Such withdrawal has not yet been finalized, and it is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might ‎impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the Paris Agreement. Further, several states and local ‎governments have stated their commitment to its principles in their effectuation of policy and regulations. We continue to monitor the international, state and local efforts to address climate change. To the extent the United States and other countries implement the Paris Agreement, or a replacement accord, or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.
Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, and effects upon sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our operations and those of our customers, have the potential to be affected adversely. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or floods, or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath 
21

of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the operations of our customers, and the service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. Our operations along the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems and our insurance may not cover all associated losses. We are taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Employees
Currently, we do not have any employees. We rely solely on officers and employees of our General Partner to operate and manage our business. Our General Partner employed 211 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our General Partner considers its employee relations to be good.
