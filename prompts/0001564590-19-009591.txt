Our Mission
 YogaWorks is a healthy lifestyle brand focused on enriching and transforming lives through yoga. We strive to honor and empower our students’ journey toward personal growth and well-being, no matter their age or physical ability, in an inclusive and community-oriented environment.
Historical Background
 Our operating subsidiary, Yoga Works, Inc., was formed as a California corporation in 1987. Since its formation, we have grown from a single studio in Santa Monica, California to 69 studios in nine markets, primarily through acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, through new studio openings. 
 On April 10, 2017, we changed our name from YWX Holdings, Inc. to YogaWorks, Inc. On August 16, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) whereby we sold 7,300,000 shares of our common stock registered at a price of $5.50 per share. We received proceeds from our IPO of $37.6 million after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions of $2.5 million, but before deducting offering costs of $2.6 million. Following our IPO, our shares of common stock have traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “YOGA”. 
 We are one of the largest providers of high-quality yoga instruction in the U.S., with almost 3.4 million student visits in 2018 and 69 company-owned studios, as well as our Internet-based digital media service, MyYogaWorks.com.
 YogaWorks is the only national, multi-discipline yoga instruction company, and our highly recognizable brand is present in nine geographically dispersed U.S. markets—Los Angeles, Orange County (California), Northern California, Houston, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, New York City, and Boston. Our teachers taught over 237,000 classes in our studios and attracted more than 281,000 students in 2018. Since 1990, we have offered the YogaWorks teacher training program, which we believe is the gold standard within the yoga community and respected across the globe for instructing teachers on how to teach yoga to a broad population of students. We believe our YogaWorks teacher training program extends our brand beyond our current nine markets and that many of our 13,000 graduates serve as ambassadors of the YogaWorks brand and help us identify new markets.
 YogaWorks for Everybody
 We believe our approach to yoga has broad appeal and positions us for continued success. We strive to make yoga accessible to everyone and offer a lifestyle approach that can be applied on and off the mat. We help people improve their physical and mental well-being through the 5,000-year old tradition of yoga, which we practice as a community-oriented experience. Our bright, clean and inspiring studios offer a broad range of yoga disciplines and ability levels to meet the needs of a wide variety of students—from fast-paced flow to soothing restorative or integrated fitness classes. Our classes are designed to safely challenge practitioners of all levels, making yoga accessible to a diverse population ranging from beginners and casual practitioners to seasoned yogis and professional athletes. Students with limited mobility or those intimidated by traditional gym environments can stretch their bodies and their minds at YogaWorks to achieve a sense of accomplishment and relaxation and advanced yogis can be challenged by our seasoned teachers who provide a challenging and rigorous curriculum to deepen their practice.
 We believe our teacher training offerings enhance our brand, provide us with a steady stream of well-trained, talented teachers, and help us maintain a leadership position in the industry. Our training program is also an effective outreach tool, as our graduates often become ardent champions of our brand and programming. Additionally, by offering teacher training classes in geographies where we do not operate a studio, we are able to extend our brand to new U.S. regions.
 To make yoga accessible, we offer flexible pricing options that provide greater value with increased class usage. Students can choose from membership programs (monthly, six months or annual), packages of classes or

single drop-in classes. Whether students seek a long-term commitment or single session, they can find a studio and class that works for them.
 In addition to our in-studio instruction and teacher training programs, YogaWorks has developed, and markets and sells online subscriptions to MyYogaWorks.com, an on-demand video library of over 1,200 proprietary instructional classes that allows students to practice yoga anytime, anywhere. We believe our MyYogaWorks.com classes are complementary to our in-studio classes as students can focus on a particular pose, hone a skill or continue their practice between visits. Our video classes are expertly taught by YogaWorks-trained teachers. While there is no hands-on instruction or community participation, MyYogaWorks.com offers students another way to connect with us and to access yoga in a convenient manner to further their healthy lifestyle. MyYogaWorks.com streamed over 660,000 classes to about 20,000 users in more than 194 countries in 2018. Through MyYogaWorks.com, we are also able to extend our brand presence beyond our physical studio footprint and allow our teachers to reach students beyond the classroom. 
 Financial Performance
 We derive our revenues from multiple sources, including in-studio instruction and retail sales, teacher training, workshops and subscriptions to MyYogaWorks.com. We believe our compelling value proposition to our students, consisting of competitive pricing for high-quality instruction, has also driven our growth throughout a variety of economic cycles and conditions since we were founded in 1987.
 Our significant growth is reflected in:
  
• | 69 studios at December 31, 2018 reflecting a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 19.2%, from 24 studios at December 31, 2012 (primarily related to our acquisition of 17 studios, 16 studios and 5 studios, in 2015, 2017 and 2018, respectively);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3.4 million visits in 2018, reflecting a CAGR of 11.2%, from 1.8 million visits in 2012; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Net revenues of $59.6 million in 2018, reflecting a CAGR of 8.6%, from $36.4 million in 2012.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our recent growth has been driven by our strategy of adding studios primarily through acquisitions and selectively opening new studios. Through acquisitions we can quickly gain students, grow our market share and build on the operating momentum of these acquired businesses. Our acquisition strategy also allows us to immediately gain a strong presence in targeted markets and local communities.
 We have developed a multi-factor evaluation system that allows us to quickly assess potential acquisition candidates and continually add qualified new targets to our active outreach process. We have also built an efficient due diligence review workflow, and a proven post-acquisition integration methodology that is designed to facilitate a seamless student, teacher and staff transition to the YogaWorks operating model. In addition, we have a proven history of retaining and improving the student and teacher focus of each studio or chain of studios acquired. Our acquired studios have experienced positive results under our ownership, benefiting from being part of our brand and implementing our best practices.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 Market Awareness, Yoga Participation and Spend
 The practice of yoga in the U.S. is gaining popularity. According to the IBISWorld Report, approximately 37 million Americans practiced yoga in 2016, up from approximately 20 million in 2012, representing 80% growth. According to the Sports Club Advisors, Inc. Industry Snap Shot from April 2016, the number of yoga practitioners is expected to grow to 55.1 million Americans in 2020, representing 50% more participants than 2016. Yoga awareness among Americans has increased from 75% to 2012 to 90% in 2016, according to the 2016 Yoga in America Study. According to the same study, in 2016, yoga practitioners spent over $16 billion on instruction, apparel, equipment and yoga accessories; over one-third of that figure, or approximately $5.8 billion, was spent on instruction in 2016. At $16 billion in 2016, spending on yoga has increased by $6 billion since 2012.
 In addition to the increasing number of young yoga practitioners, there are more male and older yoga practitioners today than ever before and they are growing at meaningful rates. Approximately 10 million men and 14 
 6


million practitioners over the age of 50 participated in yoga in 2016. Comparatively, only 4 million men and 4 million practitioners over the age of 55 participated in yoga in 2012. As the U.S. population ages and continues to live longer, many of the benefits of yoga, which include strength, flexibility and mental clarity, will continue to be relevant to more people across all age groups and drive more people to try yoga. The average age of a yoga practitioner is 32, which is nearly a decade younger than the average age of a person in the traditional fitness market. This is not surprising as yoga is increasingly being offered in schools (from preschool to high school) due to its physical benefits as well as a way of calming students’ minds and reducing stress. This trend towards students learning yoga at a young age continues as more schools and communities adopt this view of yoga.
 Appeal to Broad Demographic
 We offer a high-quality fitness experience throughout our entire yoga studio network that appeals to a broad student demographic at attractive price points. The variety of classes and styles we teach distinguishes us from our competition and allows us to accommodate students from a wide range of backgrounds. We make yoga accessible to a diverse population ranging from beginners and practitioners with physical limitations and limited mobility, to advanced yogis and super fit athletes. We strive to create a welcoming and non-judgmental environment, where we are able to attract a broad demographic based on age, household income, gender and ethnicity. Our student base is approximately 80% female and 20% male with over 60% of the students earning over $75,000. In addition, our student base is widely distributed in age ranging from 25 to 64 years old with the majority of our students having attended or graduated college. We believe our broad appeal, our pricing strategy and our ability to attract occasional and first-time yoga users as well as advanced practitioners position us to continue to reach large segments of the population in a variety of markets and geographies across the U.S. 
Our Growth Strategy
 We believe we are ideally positioned to consolidate the highly fragmented yoga studio market. We plan to strengthen our presence in existing markets and selectively enter new markets predominantly by acquiring independently owned yoga studios. Based upon internal and third-party analysis of the number of currently existing yoga studios throughout the U.S., and assuming sufficient access to capital and successful execution of our business plan, we believe we have the opportunity to increase our studio count to over 250 studios in the next several years. We believe that acquisitions of existing studios and their thriving student bases can be an effective, profitable and risk-mitigating way to enter a new regional market versus building a new studio and waiting for attendance to ramp up over time. We will, however, selectively open new YogaWorks studios to complement existing and acquired regional studio clusters where there is sufficient density of population to support more of our studios.
 Over the past 16 years, we have successfully integrated numerous acquisitions. In 2003, we acquired 3 studios located in Orange County, California. In 2004, we acquired 2 studios in the Los Angeles area and 4 studios in the New York City area (6 studios total). In 2007, we acquired one studio in the Los Angeles area. In 2008, we acquired 3 studios in the Northern California area. In 2013, we acquired 2 more studios in the Los Angeles area. In 2015, we acquired 17 studios through four acquisitions (Be Yoga, Yoga Tree, Back Bay Yoga Studio and Charm City Yoga). In 2017, we acquired 16 studios through five acquisitions (Tranquil Space, Pure Prana, Pure Om, YogaOne and Infinity Yoga). In 2018, we acquired 5 studios through two acquisitions (Prana Power Yoga and Inner Strength Yoga).
 We believe our significant experience in identifying attractive acquisition targets, our industry reputation, our proven integration process and solid operational infrastructure create a compelling platform for growth via acquisitions. Through future acquisitions, we can leverage our corporate infrastructure to grow our brand in both new and existing markets by quickly tapping into the existing yoga communities that already exists in nearly every city in the U.S. For the yoga student, this expansion plan offers greater choices for quality yoga and the ability to practice at a greater number of locations across the U.S. Finally, for the yoga teacher, our expansion provides the opportunity to teach more classes for a single employer with the ability to qualify for insurance and other employee benefits that are often not available when teaching for independent studios.

Drive Increased Visits, Net Revenues and Regional Market Share
 We remain focused on developing and offering high-quality yoga programming supported by our industry-leading teacher training to drive increased visits, net revenues and regional market share.
 Specifically, we intend to generate growth in visits, net revenues and market share by executing on the following strategies:
  
• | Increase our Brand Awareness. We will continue to increase YogaWorks’ brand awareness and consumer loyalty through new and innovative marketing outreach, studio acquisitions, new studio openings and expansion of our digital presence. Our marketing efforts reflect our authentic and localized brand characteristics, and are comprised of grassroots and word-of-mouth marketing that include local events to enhance our unique profile in the communities where we operate. Our ability to engage with consumers across nine regional markets demonstrates the effectiveness of our nationally-managed, but locally-focused marketing spend. In addition to our programming, we also engage with students through our mobile application that allows them to plan and reserve classes and to learn more about their teachers. Additionally, we are launching new initiatives through technology investments to better communicate digitally with our consumer base. We believe that increased brand awareness for YogaWorks will result in increased studio visits and net revenues and ultimately enhance profitability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Teacher Training and Workshops. As one of the most recognized teacher training programs in yoga, we plan to continue investing in the continuing education of our students and teachers, thereby driving the profitable revenues that the teacher training program brings to our company. Workshops, primarily used to deepen our students’ practice, have also been an incremental revenue opportunity by utilizing excess studio room capacity. Workshops are also a chance for popular teachers to earn additional income. In addition, workshops allow our students and teachers to access visiting master yoga teachers from around the world as well as renowned health and wellness experts in order to deepen their practice and earn continuing education credits. We believe our highly trained teachers, teacher training programs and our workshops inspire deep brand loyalty across our consumer base, driving visits and net revenues growth, while preserving our industry leadership.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow MyYogaWorks.com. We plan to continue to add quality content for MyYogaWorks.com, improving the user experience and increasing the site’s functionality, including potentially adding live streaming. We are launching several initiatives to cross-promote consumers who use MyYogaWorks.com to join us in our studios for live instruction and hands-on one-on-one attention from our teachers. We are also exploring relationships with companies and complementary brands to drive growth and increase awareness of the MyYogaWorks.com platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leverage our Infrastructure
 In preparation for our continued growth, we have built out our corporate infrastructure over the past several years. We now have the corporate, regional and studio-level management personnel in place, as well as the information technology platform, to support our future growth and acquisition strategy, without significant new investments in corporate infrastructure. Our existing infrastructure in administration, accounting, information technology, our new website, human resources, training, marketing and operating systems and processes can be leveraged across all additional studios to eliminate duplicative costs in acquired studios and realize synergies. With a larger number of studios, we believe we will be able to negotiate and secure more favorable rates for insurance, bank fees, merchandise and/or certain capital expenditures. As our studio base grows, expenses for our corporate and regional overhead should become a smaller percentage of our net revenues. We will also continue to benefit from our strategy of “clustering” studios in distinct geographic regions. By building scale in existing markets, we will increase our local brand awareness and consumer engagement without spending incrementally more on marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.

Pursue Brand Extension Opportunities
 We intend to extend and monetize the YogaWorks brand in the following areas:
  
• | Corporate Relationships. We believe we can capitalize on our position as an industry authority on high-quality, multi-discipline yoga to establish relationships with large corporations, health insurers and other institutions to incorporate YogaWorks classes into their employee wellness programs and encourage them to promote the usage of YogaWorks studios.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail. We believe that our retail and merchandise offerings contribute to a high quality in-studio environment for our students and better enable them to live the YogaWorks lifestyle. In addition, there is considerable opportunity to expand our retail and merchandising offerings going forward, including the launch of YogaWorks-branded apparel and accessories as well as offering select merchandise to be sold via e-commerce.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licensing. We believe we have an opportunity to license the YogaWorks brand into new complementary healthy lifestyle categories that would benefit from our brand reputation and market recognition. Examples include licensing MyYogaWorks.com content to media companies and content providers and through alternative online distribution channels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Publishing of Digital Content. We also see an opportunity to publish our yoga class content and stream live classes via MyYogaWorks.com which will help us maintain our industry leadership position and increase the additional revenue that could be generated through our planned e-commerce platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming
 Our programming supports a multi-channel distribution platform designed to serve our students wherever they want to practice yoga. We strive to create a seamless experience that integrates the offerings available through our studios, a variety of special events and MyYogaWorks.com. As a result, YogaWorks students can continue their practice wherever they may be, whether in our studio, at home or while travelling. Our continued national expansion will only further this benefit for our students.
 In-Studio Programming
 Our diverse in-studio programming and focus on instruction provides a differentiated and ideal environment for both seasoned yogis as well as beginners and casual enthusiasts. We believe we have highly relevant and compelling yoga offerings that meet our students’ needs. Further, given our teachers’ deep knowledge of yoga traditions and teaching styles, we have proven insights into changing yoga trends and consumer preferences. We are able to quickly interpret these trends for our students through our evolving and thoughtful schedule of classes. Our local approach to programming allows us to tailor our schedule in each market to best serve our students’ needs based on the nuances of each community.
 We have created a variety of classes for each skill level, which allows us to offer our students multiple paths on their journey from beginner to experienced yogi. Class types include fast-paced flow classes (such as Vinyasa flow, some set to music), slower and more stretch oriented sessions (such as our signature YogaWorks, Hatha or Yin classes), relaxing restorative classes (to soothe and calm the body and mind), beginners and gentle offerings (that move slowly and focus on basics), and even integrated fitness options (such as SculptWorks and BarWorks). As we strive to be inclusive and flexible with our offerings, classes are determined and scheduled based on consumer acceptance and attendance. Furthermore, we carefully review classes and teachers monthly, making adjustments as appropriate, to optimize the style, duration, teacher and time of day for every class.
 We have a disciplined operating structure that shares best practices across our different regions in order to maintain a consistently high level of service. We also have a dedicated Customer Experience team that seeks to uphold the YogaWorks standards and deliver a consistent YogaWorks experience. We believe this sets us apart from our competition, as we are able to operate successful studios in many different markets that share the YogaWorks brand, while at the same time providing flexibility to accommodate regional differences.

MyYogaWorks.com Programming
 MyYogaWorks.com is an online, on-demand video library of over 1,200 instructional classes that allows students to personalize their yoga practice anytime, anywhere. Through MyYogaWorks.com, we are able to extend our brand presence beyond our physical studio footprint. In 2018, MyYogaWorks.com streamed over 660,000 classes to about 20,000 users in more than 194 countries. We produce our own professional-quality content in-house and own the content for multiple distribution opportunities. We feel it is important to update our video library and film new videos each month to rotate our featured classes and provide more teachers, styles and options to our growing customer base.
 MyYogaWorks.com offers more than just online classes. We have created an online yoga community where we nurture a health and wellness lifestyle. Members can save their favorite classes, create their own playlists and provide feedback. Students can also elect to participate in a Journey Series which is curated content on a particular pose, benefit, or style to motivate a student to accomplish a particular goal in a 5-, 10- or 14-day sequence.
 Above all, our online videos are of exceptional quality. Each teacher featured must be Yoga Alliance certified, and is trained to give clear alignment cues and create safe sequences for our practitioners to follow despite there being no ability for hands-on adjustments. While anyone can post yoga videos to the Internet, it is the high-quality teacher instruction that separates us from everyone else.
 Teacher Training
 With over 2,000 teachers employed in our studios, the consistent quality of our instructors is critical to our success. Innovative and comprehensive teacher training has been a core philosophical business practice since our Teacher Training program was founded over 25 years ago. In order to grow our business, we need exceptional teachers, and our teacher training program has been critical to maintaining and increasing the depth of our teacher roster. Since its inception, 13,000 teachers have graduated from our teacher training program across more than 25 countries. Our program is now considered the gold standard across the industry, with a 4.75-star (out of 5) rating from Yoga Alliance. We offer both a 200-hour and 300-hour program to prospective teachers and students. Becoming a teacher is not the only motivation for taking a 200-hour teacher training. Many students take the training simply to deepen one’s practice or have a transformational experience. We strive to continually enhance our teacher training programs with new techniques, teaching strategies and updated yoga education principles.
 We believe our teacher training programming is a primary driver of our appealing studio experience and has resulted in our strong lifestyle brand as well as our market recognition as a leading authority on the growing yoga movement, particularly for safe and effective yoga practices. We utilize this program to identify new teacher talent for our studios and it is also an effective outreach tool for YogaWorks, as our graduates often become ardent champions of our brand and programming and share their enthusiasm for our programming with other students and would-be teachers. Additionally, by offering teacher training classes in geographies where we might not operate a yoga studio, we are able to extend our brand to new locations and learn more about the local yoga communities in those markets.
 Our approach to training teachers is not YogaWorks-specific and therefore, our teacher graduates can teach at other studios, which expands the pool of prospective teachers who may select one of our programs. Our training programs are proprietary and we believe they offer teachers a compelling and differentiated teaching platform. We believe our program is respected for teaching teachers how to tailor and curate classes, have a presence in the room and truly teach students, rather than having an emphasis on teachers memorizing and repeating a rote sequence of postures.
 We have more than 85 YogaWorks teacher trainers employed worldwide who have become experts in both yoga and the art of teaching. These trainers teach classes in our studios in addition to leading our teacher training programs. In 2018, we held approximately 100 teacher training programs in 14 countries. We offer teacher training programs that are taught in our YogaWorks studios as well as in non-YogaWorks studios.

Pricing
 Classes
 Our studios have membership and class package options that are diverse, transparent and flexible, just like our classes. Our pricing plans are designed to provide our students with flexibility and compelling value at higher commitment. Whether they seek a long-term commitment or a single drop-in session, our students can find a studio and pricing option that works for them. We believe our class packages and unlimited membership programs are priced at or below the industry average while at the same time providing our students with a higher quality yoga experience.
 Pricing for our classes varies by region. As of December 31, 2018, on average, our students paid approximately $90-135 per month for a membership which includes unlimited yoga and fitness classes at our studios, with different pricing options depending on the number of studios the student wishes to access. We also offer six-month and annual prepaid memberships. For students who prefer to visit a single studio, we typically provide a variety of options from unlimited memberships to class packages in increments of 10 or 20 classes. YogaWorks unlimited memberships provide access to the following benefits: unlimited yoga and fitness classes, 1 guest pass per month, discount on monthly subscription rate for MyYogaWorks.com, rewards for referring new members, 5% discount on retail merchandise, 15% off of the student’s first private yoga packages and 15% off of the student’s first package of Pilates reformer classes (available in select studios). We also offer private classes for those who wish to receive one-on-one instruction. Our pricing strategy is simple: the more our students treat themselves to our classes, the more value and benefit they receive in return. Plus, the more a student comes to class, the more likely they are to reach his/her goals and develop a consistent practice.
Strategy
 We offer products that provide flexibility to students. We offer our students memberships, including annual memberships, and class package options that can be purchased at all of our studios or online. We believe our product offerings that provide more flexibility will draw a broader student base over time. Our intent is to focus the students’ attention on content and product, instead of price, and thereby extend our long-term brand equity as a result.
Teacher Training
 We offer both 200-hour and 300-hour programs to prospective teachers in our teacher training program.
  
• | Our YogaWorks 200-hour program is the most popular because it appeals not just to students who want to become teachers but also to those simply looking to deepen their practice. Many yoga studios will employ teachers with just 200 hours of training so this program also meets a demonstrated market need. The tuition for our 200-hour program retail for approximately $3,500.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our YogaWorks 300-hour program is designed for graduates of our 200-hour program who want to continue their studies, become better teachers or pursue teaching a YogaWorks signature class. This program includes a mentorship with a master teacher to personally hone technique with hands-on instruction in actual classes with live students. The tuition for our 300-hour program is approximately $4,200.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 MyYogaWorks.com
 MyYogaWorks.com offers unlimited access to over 1,200 online yoga classes through a monthly subscription model, offering options based on monthly price and the length of the subscription. Our most popular plan is $15 per month, with no long-term commitment. We also offer a discounted subscription rate for students that have a YogaWorks studio membership.

Acquisition Integration Strategy
 Studio acquisitions have been and are a significant part of our history and continued growth strategy as we have acquired 71% of our 69 studios. We target yoga businesses we believe we can effectively integrate with our YogaWorks brand.
 We have developed a comprehensive acquisition integration process designed to facilitate a seamless transition to the YogaWorks operating model from the vantage point of employees, students and teachers. Our goal is to remember that the student comes first and that we must maintain the momentum of a student’s practice to keep them working toward their goals. Retaining staff and teachers is important for the continuity with the students but also for the local community we value.
 We attempt to hire and retain owners as teachers after they have sold their studios to YogaWorks. Specifically, the owners from Tranquil Space, Pure Om, YogaOne, Infinity Yoga, Prana Power and Inner Strength remained with us after the closing of the applicable acquisition. In other cases, selling owners have chosen to do something different with their career following the closing of the acquisition, but have remained advocates of the YogaWorks brand, helping us continue to grow the communities they had built.
 We implement a tested, multi-stage integration process with numerous checklist items to integrate with our human resources, finance, IT, marketing and operations personnel, systems and workflow.
 We then slowly make customer-facing changes like updating signage, the studio website and our mobile application to begin the transition to the YogaWorks brand. Our integration process also includes the investment of necessary capital in newly acquired studios to upgrade facilities and equipment where appropriate, so that these studios are set up for success and have the visual elements that identify our YogaWorks brand. This thoughtful and methodical approach has proven successful in retaining students, employees and teachers and driving growth post-integration.
 Administrative Systems
 We seek to quickly integrate the acquired studio into our point of sale, accounting, human resources, information technology and other operating systems after the acquisition, thereby allowing us to more efficiently operate the studio and monitor performance. In many cases, the acquired studio already utilizes the same point of sale system as YogaWorks, which simplifies both the diligence and integration processes while reducing training costs.
Programming and Branding
 One of the most delicate areas of the integration is the programming. Our first goal is to take an even deeper dive into understanding the teachers, the mix of classes and class attendance statistics to ensure we fully understand the nuances that make programming successful at each studio. In doing so, we learn more about what appeals to the existing students and to the broader community before applying any changes. We make small programming changes at first, including monitoring attendance; however, we need to train local staff with our best practices so that each business can scale. We integrate our class formats, our branding and marketing to leverage the YogaWorks brand name and operational efficiencies. We change the brand to YogaWorks, but this change may take several months as we gain necessary permits for signage changes from landlords and/or city. This approach has earned us the reputation of being respectful to the owners and community and showing we genuinely care about our mission.
 12


Marketing
 We primarily use a combination of digital and local marketing activities in each of our studio markets to build brand awareness and increase studio attendance with existing and new students. We believe our students and teachers are the most impactful and efficient marketing tools we have. Our reputation as the premier yoga studio operator drives our viral marketing, which inspires new students to try our yoga classes. Information about our studios, schedules and numerous offerings are easily accessed via our consumer-friendly website and mobile application. We have a growing social media presence with a total following as of December 31, 2018 of over 325,000 touchpoints, including approximately 92,000 Facebook fans, 83,000 Instagram followers and 150,000 Twitter followers.
 Our marketing programs target a broad range of students, including the smaller but faster growing populations in yoga like over 65-year olds, under 18-year olds and pregnant women, for whom we believe yoga and meditation is appealing given these population groups’ lifestyles, consumer preferences and stress levels.
 Currently, we offer various introductory promotions, such as first class free or first week free, to new students. We believe that our introductory specials are an effective way for people to try YogaWorks, as it typically takes a few classes to develop a new behavior and begin the relationship building process with our studios. Once students sample our classes, our staff personally follow up to see how they enjoyed the class and offer to assist finding additional classes to try. We also send personalized direct marketing to communicate news and encourage more visits. Attracting new students is an important part of our marketing strategy as we always want to introduce new students to yoga and YogaWorks. Word-of-mouth is the strongest driver of new accounts and we also offer a student referral program to thank our loyal students for their testimonials that attract new students
 In 2018, we strengthened our marketing department with new leadership, bringing proven experience in acquiring new students. In addition, we intend to dedicate increased resources to advertising and marketing in the future. Our national marketing efforts will be complemented by our important grassroots marketing efforts led by the local teachers and studio staff. From cross-promotions with other businesses to donation classes or community events, we will continue to spread the word about YogaWorks through local efforts.
 Studios
 Our bright, clean and inspiring studios typically have two yoga rooms, space dedicated and designed for our retail offerings, lockers and restrooms. We target a size between 3,500 and 5,000 square feet, but may have larger or smaller studios depending on the market and sales and visit volume of a given studio. Many of our higher volume locations have two or three yoga rooms. Each yoga room is equipped with props for our students, including mats, blankets, blocks and straps. While the instructor leads the class at the front of the room, he or she also walks around during the class giving hands-on, one-on-one attention to individualize each student’s experience and instruct on proper technique. Our studios all have, or soon after acquisition will have, visual elements that are distinctive to the YogaWorks brand, including signage. Most importantly, we strive to provide students with a warm and appealing ambiance and customer experience from the moment they walk into our studios. Students are welcomed by our greeters who are trained to make our students feel welcome and informed about the YogaWorks experience.
Real Estate
 We opened our first studio in 1987 in Santa Monica and opened a second studio in the same area several years later. Since then, we have expanded through acquisitions and new studio openings in the greater Los Angeles area as well as in five new markets: Northern California, New York City, Boston, Baltimore/Washington, D.C. and Orange County (California). Between 1996 and July 2014, we grew from 2 studios to 27, and since our acquisition by Great Hill Partners in July 2014, we have added 47 studios and relocated or closed 5 studios. In 2017, we opened a new YogaWorks studio in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Boston and acquired 16 studios in the Washington, D.C. area, Houston and Atlanta. In 2017, we divided the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. region into two separate regions and now have 9 regions in the U.S. In 2018, we acquired 5 studios in the Boston area.

As of December 31, 2018, we operated 69 studios in nine markets in the U.S. We lease all of our studio locations and our corporate headquarters, which is located in Culver City, California. The following list shows the number of studios we operate in each major market.

 We are flexible in the type of real estate venues we will pursue, making our studio model extremely portable. We focus on securing convenient locations that include easy customer access and parking. We do not believe we need to be in malls or expensive ground floor retail locations with high foot traffic in order to drive visits to our studios. Many of our studios are located in less expensive second floor locations. Given that we are often a destination location, we do not always need to rely on foot traffic in front of our studios to the same extent as many retail stores.
 Seasonality
 We have historically experienced some seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. These variations are primarily related to increased class visits during our first quarter, as students tend to exercise more regularly at the beginning of each calendar year as a part of setting goals for the upcoming year. We also see minor fluctuations year-to-year based on class cancellations due to weather-related issues.
Competition
 Because many of our students are first-time or occasional yoga practitioners, we believe we compete with both fitness and non-fitness consumer discretionary spending alternatives for our members’ and prospective students’ time and discretionary resources.
 To a great extent, we compete with other industry participants, including:
  
• | individual, single-unit independent operators and small, multi-unit operators, with limited regional brands;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other branded operators in the yoga industry, like CorePower Yoga;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subscription based digital fitness programs and offerings, such as YogaGlo, and other mobile applications and websites that provide free instructional yoga videos, including YouTube;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | health clubs and fitness centers, some of which offer or may want to offer yoga, such as Equinox, Life Time Fitness, LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, Planet Fitness and Town Sports International;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | private studios and other boutique fitness offerings (such as those offering barre, Pilates, bootcamps and spinning);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recreational facilities established by non-profit organizations and by businesses for their employees;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | racquet, tennis and other athletic clubs;
--+------------------------------------------


• | amenity and condominium/apartment clubs;
--+-----------------------------------------

• | other retail locations such as Lululemon;

• | online/offline personal training and fitness coaching; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | businesses offering similar services.
--+--------------------------------------

 The fitness and healthy living industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Some of our competitors have national name recognition or an established presence in local markets, and some are established in markets in which we have existing stores or intend to locate new stores.
 We believe that we successfully compete based on our high-quality class offerings, diversity of programming, competitive price points, passionate and dedicated teachers and the local community culture of each of our studios. Our offerings are also often complementary to other fitness concepts.
 Our competition will continue to increase as we add studios in existing markets and expand into new markets.
 Information Technology and Systems
 We utilize MINDBODY Online, an online health-focused business management software, which handles processing class sign-ups, billing students, updating student information, processing point-of-sale transactions and online payments, tracking and analyzing sales data, studio utilization, billing performance and demographic profiles. Our websites are hosted by third parties, and we also utilize other leading third-party vendors for our key systems, including ADP and UltiPro, for payroll, and Oracle Cloud, for accounting and financial reporting. For MyYogaWorks.com, we use Recurly, a billing management software solution for payment processing, and use Ooyala, for online streaming of our MyYogaWorks.com videos.
Intellectual Property
 We own a number of registered trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries. We also own several teacher training manuals and curriculum that we use in our teacher training. In addition, we own domain names, including YogaWorks.com and MyYogaWorks.com. We believe the YogaWorks name and logo and the many distinctive marks associated with it are of significant value and are very important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we pursue registration of our marks in the U.S. and in select international jurisdictions, monitor the use of our marks and oppose unauthorized use of the marks.
 We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works, such as our library of videos streamed through MyYogaWorks.com. Such copyrighted materials are beneficial, but not material to our business.
 We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including enforcing trademark laws, as well as utilizing confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our business, including labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that govern the operation of our studios and the promotion and sale of retail merchandise.
 We are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and various other laws in the U.S. governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions. A significant

number of our employees are paid at rates related to the U.S. federal minimum wage, and past increases in the U.S. federal minimum wage have increased our labor costs, as would future increases.
 We are responsible at our studios for compliance with state laws that regulate the relationship between health clubs and their members. Nearly all states have consumer protection regulations that limit the collection of monthly membership dues prior to opening, require disclosures of pricing information, mandate the maximum length of contracts and “cooling off” periods for members (after the purchase of a membership), set escrow and bond requirements for health clubs, govern member rights in the event of a member relocation or disability, provide for specific member rights when a health club closes or relocates, or preclude automatic membership renewals.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had over 3,000 employees including nearly 2,900 part-time employees at our studios and approximately 60 employees at our corporate headquarters, currently located in Culver City, California. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees.
