Overview
We are pioneering a new category of software called Digital Optimization. Our Digital Optimization System serves as the command center for businesses to connect digital products to business outcomes. Digital optimization is emerging as a strategic investment for every company to survive in the digital-first world.
 Digital products are embedded in every part of our daily lives and digital has become the primary way business is done. The ability for companies to offer compelling digital products and services has become a matter of survival.
 The way that companies build digital products is going through a fundamental change from being intuition-based to data-driven. Product teams have historically decided what to build based on qualitative gut feel and without a firm understanding of what will drive business results. Today, the best teams are those that build their strategy around product data, which connects the attributes of individual end users with their actual behavior. Product data has become the next untapped growth lever to transform how businesses build products, gain key insights into which features have the greatest business impact, and connect with customers.
 The amount of time that consumers spend interacting with digital products has led to an explosion of both the quantity and diversity of data. Because products themselves are generators of data, for the first time, in-product behavior can now be analyzed. With product data, teams can gain insight from the specific actions end users take within digital products and answer important questions, such as where in the purchase journey do users experience friction, what are the top user paths between signup and trial conversion, and which features increase new customer retention.
 Traditionally, businesses have spent billions of dollars on a patchwork of systems, including web and marketing analytics, business intelligence tools, and sentiment tools, to help understand how their digital product investments drive business outcomes. These tools were not built on product data and do not understand in-product behavior, nor were they built for the scale and complexity of digital products to provide actionable and real-time product-driven insights. Businesses today do not know if their strategic product decisions are the right ones, and they do not have the insights to help ensure they work.
 The next evolution of digital transformation is the category-defining shift to digital optimization. The promise of digital optimization is connecting the dots between products and the business. It provides the breadth and depth of insights into customer behavior to understand what behaviors are linked to business impact. Digital optimization answers strategic questions such as what products to build, what digital bets to make, and which bets are working. It predicts which customers are likely to purchase or churn based on their behavior and automatically adapts products to each customer based on this intelligence to optimize the outcome.
While digital transformation is focused on building new digital products, digital optimization is focused on using product data to make strategic decisions and run a business, accelerate innovation, and increase the value of digital transformation efforts.
 Product, data, engineering, and marketing teams are often forced to make business decisions in a vacuum and without understanding the linkage between product decisions and business outcomes. Digital optimization leverages the power of data-driven products to create this linkage automatically. In addition, having a common lens into customer and product data helps every team transform their function, from launching brand-defining marketing campaigns to reimagining customer support. Bringing shared data and common visibility to every team will be a business-critical requirement in the digital optimization era.
 

How Amplitude Powers Digital Optimization
 We built the first Digital Optimization System that brings together a new depth of customer understanding with the speed of action to optimize experiences. We power some of the most-beloved and iconic consumer and B2B digital products. We enable businesses, regardless of size, industry, or where they are in their digital maturity, to unleash digital innovation and growth. Our system unifies product, marketing, data, and executive teams, by giving them the common visibility to drive business outcomes with agility and confidence.
 Our Digital Optimization System consists of the following integrated solutions:
 •Amplitude Analytics. G2, an independent software review site, ranked Amplitude as the #3 best software product overall and #5 best enterprise product in their 2022 Best Software Awards. The G2 Winter 2022 Report also ranked Amplitude as the #1 product analytics solution for the sixth quarter in a row, #1 in mobile analytics, and #3 in digital analytics. We provide teams with fast, self-service insights into customer behavior.
 •Amplitude Recommend. A no-code personalization solution that helps teams increase customer engagement by intelligently adapting digital products and campaigns to every user based on behavior.
 •Amplitude Experiment. An integrated end-to-end experimentation solution that enables teams to determine and deliver the most impactful product experiences for their customers through A/B tests and controlled feature releases.
 At the core of our Digital Optimization System is the Amplitude Behavioral Graph, a proprietary behavioral database purpose-built for complex, interactive behavioral queries, with novel approaches to normalizing, classifying, and partitioning behavioral data. The Behavioral Graph scales to look at every individual customer action taken in a digital product and identifies combinations of actions that lead to a desired outcome. The Behavioral Graph processes behavioral data points to help answer questions like why do users convert or drop off, which interactions predict likelihood to buy, and what are the most common paths users take.
 We are Mission Critical to Our Customers
 As of December 31, 2021, we serve more than 1,500 paying customers globally, from the most ambitious startups to the largest global enterprises. We are the trusted source of customer and product insight for the world’s leading data-driven, product-led digital companies and bring the same technology to the remaining companies that lack this expertise. We serve customers across virtually every industry, including finance, media, retail, industrials, hospitality, healthcare, media, and telecom, as well as companies in various stages of digital maturity. Digital optimization has become mission critical to companies of all sizes and in all industries to keep up with the pace of innovation required to survive in the digital-first world.
Our Digital Optimization System is mission critical to our customers’ success. Within our largest customers, thousands of users leverage our system to drive better outcomes in their respective functional areas. The broad applicability and ease of use of our system results in significant commitments by our customers as part of their core technology stack. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 385 and 262 customers, respectively, that each represented greater than $100,000 in Annual Recurring Revenue ("ARR") and 29 and 15 customers, respectively, that each represented greater than $1 million in ARR, demonstrating how critical we are to our customers’ success.
Our Business Model
 We generate revenue primarily through selling subscriptions to our platform. We reach customers through an efficient direct sales motion, solution partners, and product-led growth initiatives, including subscription plans to meet the needs of a diverse range of companies. Our pricing model is based on both the platform functionality required by our customers as well as committed event volume. For the year ended December 31, 2021, subscription revenue comprised 97% of our total revenue. Our customers typically look to use our platform for an initial business use case they have identified, such as analytics on a digital product. As our customers experience the value of our platform in helping to drive business outcomes in that initial use case, they frequently expand that initial use case, expand into new use cases, and expand into additional products. Examples of ways customers expand the use of our platform include the following:
 •Customers expand an initial use case by tracking additional events on a digital product to gain greater insight into customer journeys or add additional functionality (e.g. predictive analytics, behavioral reports) to meet the needs of teams across the organization;
 •Customers expand into new use cases by using our platform for additional digital products in their digital product portfolio and empowering additional teams (e.g. product, marketing, engineering, analytics) responsible for those digital product; and


•Customers expand by layering on additional offerings, such as our Recommend and Experiment products, on our core Analytics offering to power new capabilities to drive business outcomes.
 Our ability to expand within our customer base is also demonstrated by our strong dollar-based net retention rate. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our dollar-based net retention rate across paying customers was 123% and 119%, respectively.
Industry Trends
 Digital is the New Battlefield for Business Survival
 Today, digital products are embedded in every part of our daily lives. The ability for companies to offer compelling digital products and services has become a matter of survival. Several mega-trends are forcing companies to move to digital first, including the continued rise of mobile and cloud, making it easier than ever for new entrants to disrupt existing markets through digital; the rise of the digital economy; and businesses' shift in focus from customer acquisition to customer retention.
The Revenue Center is Shifting from Sales and Marketing to Product
 Once considered a cost center for the business, the digital product is now becoming the primary lever in a business to drive growth. The growing importance of product-led growth to a company’s survival has fundamentally shifted how companies go to market and invest in innovation.
 The revenue center of a business is shifting away from acquisition-focused marketing and sales to retention and expansion through sustained customer engagement within digital products. User engagement, user behavior, customer retention rate, and customer lifetime value have become the new standard metrics to measure the productivity and efficiency of any business. Additionally, as heightened user and data privacy concerns move to limit the type of data app developers and advertisers can use or sell to target customers, it will become increasingly difficult for businesses to acquire their way to growth through traditional marketing and advertising initiatives.
 The Approach to Building Digital Products is Being Reinvented
 The way that companies build digital products is going through a fundamental shift from being intuition-based to using data derived from the digital product itself to make decisions. Data-driven products:
 •Are Centered in Behavioral Data. The amount of time that consumers spend interacting with digital products has led to an explosion of both the quantity and diversity of data. Because the digital products themselves are generators of data, this means that in-product behavior can be observed and analyzed for the first time. 
 •Adapt to the Customer. In a world of abundant choice, the expectations of consumers for businesses to deliver highly-personalized digital product experiences continues to be on the rise. The best-in-class digital companies leverage product data to build robust recommendation engines based on artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) algorithms to deliver highly differentiated experiences at scale. 
 •Leverage Data Democratization and Common Visibility. Between product management, engineering, design, marketing, sales, customer success, business operations, and executive teams, there may be thousands of people in an organization who rely on data as part of their daily responsibilities. Marketing and centralized data teams have traditionally been tasked with the responsibility of aggregating data from various data silos. They analyze data to extract insights and distribute regularly scheduled or ad-hoc reports to various stakeholders. This operating model creates significant barriers for making the data accessible to all who need it, relying on teams of data scientists to serve as intermediaries and tools that require SQL expertise. Even simple data requests can at times lead to weeks or months of cycle time, reducing the agility for business owners to get the data they need to make critical business and product decisions.
 Data and insights are only valuable if they can be leveraged by cross-functional stakeholders jointly responsible for making decisions. When product data acts as a single source of truth, every team has access to the same common data to explore and reach alignment on shared goals and actions plans. Data-driven organizations that make data both accessible and actionable enable their teams to expedite the decision making process, thereby iterating on and improving their digital products with greater agility. The faster organizations are able to iterate, the stronger their systematic advantages are against competitors that lack such expertise. With digital products becoming the revenue center of business, a new generation of digital leaders that span across all functions within an organization is required.
The Next Frontier of Digital Transformation Brings the Imperative of Digital Optimization
 While digital transformation is focused on building web-enabled customer experiences, the next evolution of digital transformation is the category-defining shift to digital optimization. Digital optimization moves beyond building new digital products and is focused on using product data to make strategic decisions to run the business, accelerate product innovation, and increase the value of digital transformation efforts. The promise of digital optimization is connecting the dots between product decisions and business outcomes. Digital optimization provides a new breadth and depth of insights into customer behavior to understand what drives business impact. It tells companies what products to build, what digital bets to make to accelerate innovation, what product changes to make based on the features or actions that correlate to impact, when a business initiative is not working in order to stop wasting time and resources, and provides insight to adapt digital product experiences to each customer to maximize engagement, retention, and lifetime value. Digital optimization leverages the power of data-driven products to create this linkage automatically and answer the fundamental question: how does digital product drive one’s business?
Digital optimization will be a strategic business imperative as digital transformation continues at an accelerated pace and to help ensure businesses are making the right product bets and to maximize their impact to make sense of the exponential increase in digital product and user behavioral data.
Businesses Need a Fundamentally New Approach to Drive Digital Optimization
 Businesses have spent billions of dollars on a patchwork of systems to help understand how their digital product investments drive business outcomes. However, these systems were not built for insight on product data in real time and at scale, leveraging the wrong data and undertaking a misguided approach.
 Why is product data different?
1.Complexity. Digital products are complex, which means that product data operates at a qualitatively different scale than transactional or digital marketing data.
 2.Non-Linear. Unlike traditional marketing funnels where the goal is strictly increasing the conversion rate to the next step, users do not take a linear journey through a digital product. Based on our customer data, we estimate that, on average, there are approximately 2,500 distinct events that can be measured within each digital product. Each user therefore navigates through an application across multiple devices in a random walk that is unique from every other user. This effect makes it much harder to understand what is happening in the aggregate and generate insights at scale.
 3.Scale. Combining the number of digital product users a company may have and the amount of engagement per user can result in billions of potential events per product. This scale presents near-insurmountable challenges for any business looking to optimize their digital products to drive outcomes on both a micro and macro level.
 The sum of all this complexity means existing categories of software fail to understand product data and were not designed to adequately address the needs of today’s digital optimization era:
 •Web and Marketing Analytics. These solutions focus on using web and demographic data to analyze target users and advertising spend. They were most relevant for the Web 1.0 era, when marketers focused on pageviews, campaign sources, clicks, and other surface-level metrics. They were not built for in-product and in-app behavior, deep personalization based on AI/ML, multi-platform end-user journeys, and modern digital measurements. Moreover, many of these solutions are built on a pre-computation data framework – whereby queries are completed in advance and cached versus performed on the fly – which prohibits flexibility for real-time analysis. This data approach is incompatible with fast moving, collaborative teams that need easy-access data to find, ask, and answer in an iterative fashion and use data to power product experiences at the moment a user engages.
 •Business Intelligence. These solutions are horizontally focused and built for reporting on object-level data and transactional data, not behavioral data. The implementation of these systems can often take years and requires significant investments in the form of teams specializing in data and analytics to deploy, maintain, and use. Oftentimes built on large data lakes of structured and unstructured data, data teams must scrub, clean, instrument, and canonicalize the data, and then use complex SQL queries to answer even the most basic questions. This process is cumbersome and slow because SQL queries are not designed for user-joins, which connect disparate end-user actions together and are the key to understanding end-user behavior in product, and leads to product and business teams being bottlenecked as they wait for answers. Even when these “blank canvas” environments have been custom built for non-technical users, they are often inflexible and disconnected from their workflows – leaving teams without answers or the ability to act.
 

•Sentiment / Survey-based Solutions. These solutions are focused on uncovering and understanding customer sentiment to improve customer experiences – often non-digital – and include qualitative measurements such as surveys. They are not designed to generate product insight and analyze behavioral data, limiting the applicability outside of customer service, researchers, and marketing teams. Relying on sentiment data in a silo provides an imprecise and incomplete picture of the customer and does not close the loop from insight to action.
 The Amplitude Digital Optimization System
 We built the first Digital Optimization System that brings together a new depth of customer understanding with the speed of action to optimize experiences in the moment. It is the only unified system that answers the question: “How do your digital products drive your business?” We power the most-beloved digital products and teams with actionable data and insights – regardless of size, industry, or digital maturity – so they can unleash digital innovation and growth. We make critical data accessible and actionable to every team – allowing product, marketing, engineering, analytics, customer success, and executive teams to align around common visibility and to drive business outcomes with greater speed, agility, and confidence.
 
In today’s digital-first world, we believe every organization must transform into data-driven teams and products that create competitive advantages and long-term value for both their customers and businesses. A Digital Optimization System is essential in this new reality – helping businesses understand how their customers use their products, make better decisions, build personalized experiences that engage and retain customers, and measure performance. With us, teams have access to a fully integrated, self-service system for data, analytics, and personalization – with intelligence and collaboration built in to help teams innovate faster and smarter.
 For instance, we helped a leader in online food delivery answer, “What is the most profitable delivery model that also maximizes order frequency and size?” A popular meditation app discovered the answer to, “How can we redesign our content and app to increase user retention?” And a software company aligned thousands of users across the organization around key metrics and explored questions like, “Why do certain marketing channels show high engagement but low downstream user conversions and revenue?”


Our Digital Optimization System consists of the following integrated components:
 •Amplitude Analytics. G2, an independent software review site, ranked Amplitude as the #3 best software product overall and #5 best enterprise product in their 2022 Best Software Awards. The G2 Winter 2022 Report also ranked Amplitude as the #1 product analytics solution for the sixth quarter in a row, #1 in mobile analytics, and #3 in digital analytics. We provide teams with fast, self-service insights into customer behavior.
 •Amplitude Recommend. A no-code personalization solution that helps teams increase customer engagement by intelligently adapting digital products and marketing channels to every user – with behavioral and predictive segmentation to build and sync audiences to marketing tools and a self-serve recommendation engine to instantly enable in-product personalization.
 •Amplitude Experiment. An integrated end-to-end solution that allows teams to better control feature releases, configure product experiences for different end users, and run the end-to-end feature experimentation process from generating a hypothesis to targeting users, rolling out A/B tests, and measuring results.
 •Amplitude Behavioral Graph. A purpose-built proprietary database for deep, real-time interactive behavioral analysis and behavior-driven personalization – instantly joining, analyzing, and correlating any customer actions to outcomes – like engagement, growth, and loyalty.
 •Data Management. A real-time data layer for planning, integrating, and managing data sources to create a complete, trustworthy foundation with identity resolution, enterprise-level security, and privacy solutions embedded throughout.
 We power digital optimization for our customers through the following key system capabilities:
 •Behavioral Data at the Core. We designed data and machine-learning infrastructure purpose-built to understand cross-device and cross-product end-user data – enabling businesses to see, analyze, and act on behavioral data. Our infrastructure is structured around user-joins and partitioned by end users, which is the key to understanding end user behavior in-product. The Amplitude Behavioral Graph processes behavioral data points to help answer questions like why users convert or drop off, which interactions predict likelihood to buy, and what are the most common paths end users take.
 •Built-In Data Management. Our system includes a comprehensive, built-in data integration and governance suite to plan, integrate, and manage large, distributed data sources in real time. It automatically resolves user identities, normalizes and transforms data into one stream, and governs data quality, consistency, and access across organizations of any size, which is critical for analytics and personalization initiatives.
 •Real-time Analytics and Insight. We provide the market-leading product analytics solution that enables teams to access out-of-the-box reporting to instantly answer both simple and complex questions about product and customer behaviors. Teams can easily analyze any end-user path across multiple devices, products, and channels from an aggregate to individual end-user level to understand the context behind every end-user action and identify opportunities to improve the digital product experience.
 •Easy Adoption and Collaboration. Our system provides an easy-to-use interface that allows for viral adoption and democratization of insights within an organization, regardless of technical abilities. Within minutes a new customer on our system can start generating insights relevant to their respective functional areas and engaging with collaborative dashboards, reports, and tools that allow a broad spectrum of people in an organization to participate in data-driven decision making. This ease of use fuels cross-functional adoption that can scale to thousands of active users surfacing insights and sharing findings.
 •Powering Data-Driven Action. Our system allows teams to directly turn end-user insight into action with personalized, Netflix-like product experiences in a few clicks and without requiring technical expertise. We use sophisticated identity resolution and targeting to reach the right end user, machine-learning recommendations to decide the right content, and real-time integrations with systems our customers already use for delivery at the right time. Additionally, our customers can deploy and test new experiences using the first experimentation and feature management solution powered by behavioral data and product analytics. For example, our system can predict the likelihood a customer will churn based on their behavior and of those statistically similar, and the system will automatically test which campaign or in-product experience is best optimized to drive retention. 
 •Enterprise-grade Platform. Our platform is architected to handle a scale qualitatively different from what is capable by existing customer engagement and experience tools. We offer top-tier security and reliability as our platform is SOC2 Type-2 and ISO 27001 certified, offers single sign-on support and user permissioning, is a recognized AWS Partner for Digital Customer Experience, and has delivered a 99.99% data ingestion uptime service-level agreement (“SLA”) with 99.97% data durability for the year ended December 31, 2021.


Key Benefits to Our Customers
Our system provides the following key benefits to our customers:
•Enable the Right Product Bets and Accelerate Innovation. We enable our customers to answer the critical questions about how their end users are using their digital products and what behaviors lead to better business outcomes. Every click, every interaction, and every event we collect is input from end users that help to inform what actions teams can take to optimize digital products in real time. Our customers are able to analyze behaviors, track engagement, spot friction in the buying process, and understand the drivers of conversion. These insights allow teams to make the right product bets, assess and measure the impact of those decisions, feed learnings back into the system, and rapidly iterate to resolve potential problems before they impact customer acquisition, retention, and lifetime value.
 •Unify Teams with Common Visibility. We bring a common set of user behavior and in-product engagement data to every team, from product, to marketing, to data science, and beyond. Out-of-the-box dashboards and analytics reports provide common visibility leveraging the same data, while teams can easily click into each report to get as much granularity as required to inform actions and recommendations. Dashboards allow teams to also solve use cases specific to their area of responsibility, for example, understanding what behavior drives conversions to optimize marketing campaigns. This visibility results in better decisions, faster actions, better outcomes, and transformed customer experiences. Our system represents a single source of truth about in-product customer user behavior, and a common place where teams can share results, learn from each other, and plan action together.
 •Maximize Value of Product Investments. The ability of our system to attribute revenue to specific product investments transforms what has traditionally been viewed as a cost center into a revenue center. This ability unleashes a much more powerful way to operate when companies can make investments with confidence and drive product-led growth.
Our Growth Strategies
 We intend to pursue the following growth strategies:
 •Acquire New Customers Across Every Industry. We believe that our Digital Optimization System is applicable to businesses across industries, company size, and stage of digital maturity. We plan to invest to capture the significant market opportunity we believe is only in its early innings. We have experienced rapid growth in our customer base since our inception and had over 1,500 paying customers and 26 of the Fortune 100 as of December 31, 2021, which demonstrates both our successful traction to date as well as our significant opportunity to continue to penetrate the largest global organizations. We believe we have an efficient and productive go-to-market motion that will allow us to continue to acquire new customers and grow our customer base. Additionally, as more companies and industries continue their transformation into digital-first companies, we believe our immediate potential customer base will grow as we help these companies address their digital optimization needs. We are focused on winning key reference accounts among industries and emerging use cases to establish ourselves as the system of choice for the next wave of digital innovation.
 •Expand Across Our Existing Customer Base. We believe that there are significant opportunities to continue to expand our relationships with our existing customers. Our pricing model, based on platform functionality and committed event volume, allows us to grow as our customers grow. We employ a land and expand business model designed to land with an initial use case and expand through onboarding additional functional teams, products, and use cases.
 oPromote Upsell: Once a customer is on our platform there are many ways we can promote upsell opportunities. Customers can expand an initial use case by adding additional events or functionality to generate deeper analytics. They can also expand into additional functional teams who are looking to address a related use case or bring new digital products on our platform, both of which require additional data to be instrumented. As the strategic value of our platform grows as more data is instrumented and insights generated and shared, it becomes easier to find additional upsell opportunities across digital products, use cases, and teams.
 oDrive Cross-sell: Our platform delivers end-to-end optimization that allows our customers to expand beyond analytics and layer on additional products, such as Recommend and Experiment, and we offer to optimize the digital product experiences of their customers.
 Within our largest customers, we have demonstrated our ability to grow our reach to include thousands of users across their organization who leverage our system to drive business outcomes. Our dollar-based net retention rate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 123% and 119%, respectively, for paying customers. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 385 and 262 customers, respectively, that each represented greater than $100,000 in ARR and 29 and 15 customers, respectively, that each represented greater than $1 million in ARR, demonstrating how critical we are to our customers’ success.



•Extend Product Leadership with Continued Investment in Our Platform. We see significant opportunities to leverage the same data stream powering our core analytics suite to layer on additional products that address adjacent high-value use cases desired by our customers. As a product-led company, the valuable feedback loop we have established with our own customers helps us identify product and platform enhancements best aligned to drive our future growth.
 •Expand our Global and Partnership Reach. We believe there is significant potential to continue to grow our business in international markets because of the universal nature of the problem we help to solve. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 36% of our revenue was generated outside of the United States. Additionally, we plan to continue to invest in our partner network to strengthen our ecosystem and extend our reach.
 Our Platform and Technology
 Data enters our system through many sources, including our software-development kits ("SDKs"), server side, and integration with our partner systems. It then goes through the processing and cleanup stage before being stored in our behavioral graph which is a user-oriented distributed columnar data store. Our Behavioral Graph powers the analytics, collaboration, prediction, and recommendation platform.
 We have designed a system that can process large amounts of data and provide an interactive query/response model. Instead of building a general purpose data storage and processing system similar to data warehouses that would require our users to know SQL and wait a long time to get answers to their analytics-oriented join-heavy queries, we have built a brand new system from the ground up focused on end-user behavior analysis that is optimized to ingest, process, and store it in a specific format, and structure to power low latency query/response.
 Real-time Data Management
The underpinning of the Digital Optimization System is our real-time Data Management layer. This layer includes our core data platform that offers our customers a number of tools and capabilities for ingesting data to us, resolving identity to create a consistent and unique identity, and managing customer and product data.
 Key differentiators include:
 •Structured, event-based schema. We ingest and process event data. Each event represents an interaction that an end user or device performed on our customers’ products. Event data has information about the event as well as the end user and device that has performed the event, and it follows a specific but flexible schema. As event data enters our platform, it gets ingested, sanitized, enriched, and canonicalized and is stored in an optimized format in our behavioral graph to enable low latency query/response.
 •Breadth and scale of digital sources. We have a number of tools and offerings such as several client-side and server-side SDKs, APIs, and integration with customer storage systems such as Amazon S3 and data warehouses that allows us to ingest from a number of sources, including mobile applications, websites, and backend services.
 •Identity resolution for a multi-platform world. In the multi-platform world, end users interact with our customers’ products through many devices; it is logged in at times and anonymous at other times. Our identity resolution service automatically captures one consistent view of the customer’s usage across platforms through continuous event streaming as users log in and out of customers’ products, browse anonymously, and use multiple devices.


Amplitude Behavioral Graph
 Event data is fed into the Amplitude Behavioral Graph, which is purpose-built to handle the scale, speed, and complexity of user behavior in digital products. It is the foundation of all of the analytics and personalization applications as part of the Digital Optimization System.
 Key differentiators include:
 •Complex distributed joins. The most important user behavior questions involve looking at many different points in a user’s journey to answer, traditionally referred to as “joins” in SQL-based systems. At scale, this must be done in a distributed manner, and the more sophisticated the product the more complex the questions become. We built a database from the ground up using state-of-the-art columnar storage techniques and embedded it at every layer with knowledge of behavioral data and questions –for example pre-partitioning data by user and caching partial, reusable computations. We can express the varied semantics of product questions while running at the speed of native code, allowing us to answer customers’ questions in seconds.
 •Real-time data observation. We built our database to match the speed at which digital products evolve. We use a lambda architecture with separate real-time and batch processing layers so that data is not only available for querying within seconds, but also optimized for long-term trend analysis.
 •Multi-tenancy and scale. At any point in time, there are hundreds of queries running simultaneously on our database, each of varying cost and complexity. We use a multi-tenant architecture to achieve economies of scale, and we have designed a differentiated throttling mechanism in order to isolate the effects of customers’ queries on each other.
 •AutoML. Using our structured, event-based schema and database that is embedded with an understanding of behavioral data, we have automated the most challenging part of machine learning pipelines and feature extraction. Our Behavioral Graph can generate a meaningful and robust set of thousands of features for each user in the system, which is used for a variety of applications. By having this automation with little to no customer input, we can offer truly self-service machine learning via AutoML.
 Our Customers
 Our Digital Optimization System is used globally by organizations of all sizes and across a vast range of industries. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 1,597 and 1,039 paying customers, respectively, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 54%, and 26 and 25 of the Fortune 100, respectively. We believe that our Digital Optimization System can help organizations of all sizes, from the smallest startups to the largest global organizations, unleash the power of digital optimization to drive business outcomes and deliver value to customers. We continue to increase the number of customers who have entered and grown into larger subscriptions with us. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 385 and 262 customers, respectively, that each represented greater than $100,000 in ARR, representing a 47% increase year-over-year. Additionally, we had 29 and 15 customers, respectively, that each represented greater than $1 million in ARR, up 93% year-over-year. The number of customers representing greater than $100,000 and $1 million in ARR demonstrates the strategic importance of our platform and our ability to both initially land significant accounts and grow them over time.
 Sales and Marketing

 We employ an efficient, multi-pronged go-to-market strategy combining direct sales, including field and inside sales, product-led growth initiatives, including subscription plans to meet the needs of a diverse range of companies, and marketing initiatives to supplement our sales efforts. Our field sales personnel focus on attracting new customers as well as expanding usage within our existing customer base. Our sales team is supported by business and sales development professionals and solution consultants who facilitate the sales process through identifying use cases based on customer needs, assessing requirements, addressing security and technical questions, consulting on customers’ data stacks, and finding additional expansion use cases.
 

In accordance with our ethos to empower companies of all sizes to unleash digital optimization to drive their business, we offer a variety of free and paid plans depending on our customers’ needs. For startups, we offer a Scholarship plan, which consists of a self-serve, free one-year subscription to our Growth plan, to help them turbo-charge their digital optimization efforts. For larger commercial companies and organizations, we offer both free and paid plans. Our free, self-serve Starter plan allows access to a limited set of core offerings, including our leading Analytics offering, and serves as effective brand marketing and a low friction model for getting a single team started with Amplitude, which can also create a glide path to conversion into one of our paid plans. Our paid Growth and Enterprise plans provide access to additional capabilities, functionality, and event volume to meet the needs of larger and more complex use cases.
Our professional services team helps customers design and execute their digital optimization, product-led growth, analytics, and personalization projects. We offer our customers implementation, training, and related services to help them realize the full benefits of our Digital Optimization System. We also work closely with our partner ecosystem to help them deploy our solutions and build our technology into their services offerings, providing opportunities for us to increase the breadth and depth of our deployment within new and existing customers.
 We have more than 60 partners in the Amplitude partner ecosystem program, which provides solutions to help accelerate our customers’ digital optimization initiatives. Our ecosystem consists of the following:
 •Solutions partners, including global systems integrators, consultancies, and digital agencies, partner with Amplitude to provide business transformation strategy, best practices, and support.
 •Technology partners, who integrate their software with the Digital Optimization System to build and deliver end-to-end enterprise technology solutions. Amplitude has dozens of technology integrations and partners across more than a dozen software categories, including marketing automation, attribution tools, data warehouses, and customer data platforms, to name a few.
 Our marketing efforts focus on driving our go-to-market demand generation engine across all market segments and across both new and existing customers, as well as raising our brand profile globally. To do this, we utilize a combination of online and offline marketing programs such as online advertising, blogs, public relations, social media, educational white papers and webinars, product demos, workshops, roundtables, and customer case studies. These gatherings focus on attracting a broad mix of prospects and customers to focus on digital optimization and Amplitude product education, and the sharing of customer success stories and best practices.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 301 employees in our sales and marketing organization.
 Human Capital Management
We believe that our company culture enables us to achieve our mission, is a core driver of our business success, and is a significant reason why people choose to build their careers at Amplitude. We are pioneers in this field who endeavor to make product, business, and people decisions that allow us to carry out our mission while staying true to our values. We believe Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") are rooted in the fabric of our culture. We advance our culture of belonging–in which Humility, Ownership, and Growth Mindset are at the center–by coming together to make a collective impact in our work and our communities. Through strategic initiatives and partnerships, policy development and stewardship, innovation and education, our DEI-embedded culture shapes our future to one where all employees can fully realize their potential.
 •Humility. No ego – we operate from a place of empathy and openness and seek to understand many points of view.
 •Ownership. We take the initiative to solve problems that drive our shared company success.
 •Growth Mindset. We’re tenacious in the face of challenges and seek input in order to grow ourselves and others.
 We use our values as the cornerstone for setting the tone for how we show up with one another and our customers. We are intentional about embedding them as the lens through which we operate. We are deliberate in operationalizing our values through our selection of talent, recognizing, rewarding, and how we celebrate. We regularly recognize and celebrate those who are exemplary models of our values through our Quarterly Values Awards. We believe that it is this focus on our values that is what sets us apart in building a culture of empathy and accountability.
 In 2021, we were recognized by San Francisco Business Times and Built In as “Best Places to Work in the Bay Area” and “Best Midsize Places to Work in the Bay Area,” respectively. Additionally, Business Insider has included us in their “Startups to bet your career on” list.


In 2020, together with four of our ecosystem partners, we announced the launch of a joint-initiative called Tech for Black Founders. Our mission is to create an ecosystem that provides resources and technology to empower Black-founded businesses and level the playing field for underserved founders. Our shared goal is to help Black-founded businesses accelerate growth and scale as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Since we began, we have received nearly 200 applications, with 83 companies currently in the program.
 We operate from a place of openness, taking initiative to drive our shared company success, while seeking input in order to grow ourselves and our customers. Our values fuel our growth, guiding us as we learn, succeed, and celebrate together.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 612 employees, including 121 employees located outside the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts are focused on continued innovation, enhancing our platform features and functionalities, and expanding the services we offer to increase market penetration and deepen our relationships with our customers. We believe the timely development of new, and the enhancement of our existing platform features and services is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We continually incorporate feedback and new cases from our customers into our platform. As of December 31, 2021, we had 130 employees in our research and development organization. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform. Research and development expenses totaled $48.3 million and $26.1 million in years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Competition
 The market for digital optimization is new and evolving. Businesses have used a range of point solutions built for other use cases in an effort to address their needs, none of which offer the breadth and depth of capabilities offered by our Digital Optimization System. However, we do compete with a number of companies, ranging from large and diversified businesses to smaller start-ups, that offer certain solutions and functionality similar to aspects of our platform. These competitors include the following:
 •product analytics point tools such as Pendo, Mixpanel, and Heap;
 •web and marketing analytics vendors such as Adobe Experience Cloud and Google Analytics; and
 •business intelligence solutions such as Looker and Tableau.
 The principal competitive factors for companies in our industry are:
 •powerful and flexible infrastructure that can ingest and manage a broad variety and large volume of data;
 •platform functionality, including speed, scale, and breadth and depth of insights;
 •size of end-user base and level of customer adoption;
 •enterprise-grade technology that is secure and reliable;
 •self-service offerings;
 •ability to enable collaboration across numerous teams;
 •ease of integration and deployment with existing IT infrastructure;
 •mindshare with line of business and non-technical teams;
 •ability to address a variety of evolving customer needs and use cases;
 •price and total cost of ownership;
 •brand awareness and reputation;
 •quality of professional services and customer support;
 •strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
 •adherence to industry standards and certifications.


On the basis of the factors above, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors. However, some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger sales forces and marketing budgets, greater brand recognition, broader distribution networks and global presence, longer operating histories, more established relationships with current or potential customers and commercial partners, and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain market share and prevent potential customers from purchasing our products. Additionally, we expect the industry to attract new entrants, who could compete with our business and introduce new offerings. As we scale and expand our business, we may enter new markets and encounter additional competition.
 Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important part of our business. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, and similar contracts, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. However, these laws, agreements, and policies provide only limited protection, and our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights may still be challenged, invalidated, infringed, or misappropriated in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. The laws of certain jurisdictions do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may therefore be difficult, impossible, or otherwise not commercially reasonable to protect our proprietary rights in certain jurisdictions. In addition, we use software components licensed from third parties under open-source software licenses, which licenses generally do not contain warranties or indemnifications from the licensors with respect to infringement, security vulnerabilities, or other issues. As a result, we would not have contractual protections if our use of the open-source software licensed from third parties infringes third-party intellectual property rights or if we encounter other issues with respect to our use of third-party open-source software. We also publicly license our SDK and certain other components to third parties pursuant to open-source licenses. The value of the software we publicly license to third parties pursuant to open-source licenses may be diminished given that such licenses grant those third parties broad rights to modify and distribute such software and could allow a competitor to more easily develop a competing product by examining our software.
 We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks and pursue patent protection of our technology in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we had five U.S. and two foreign patent applications pending. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property, and the extension of our intellectual property rights abroad. As of December 31, 2021, we had four registered trademarks in the United States, 11 registered trademarks internationally, and one trademark application pending in the United States.
Data Privacy & Security
 Numerous state, federal, and foreign laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, govern the collection, dissemination, processing, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In particular, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the "CCPA"), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the "CPRA"), and the GDPR, set strict standards for maintaining the privacy and security of personal information. Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. In sum, privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
