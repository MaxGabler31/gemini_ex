ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a leading vertically integrated company that is primarily engaged in the geothermal energy power business. We leverage our core capabilities and global presence to expand our activity in recovered energy generation and into different energy storage services and solar PV (including hybrid geothermal and solar PV as well as energy storage plus solar PV). Our objective is to become a leading global provider of renewable energy and we have adopted a strategic plan to focus on several key initiatives to expand our business.
 
We currently conduct our business activities in three business segments:
 

• | Electricity Segment. In the Electricity segment, which contributed 88.3% of our total revenues in 2021, we develop, build, own and operate geothermal, solar PV and recovered energy-based power plants in the United States and geothermal power plants in other countries around the world and sell the electricity they generate. In 2021, we derived 69.0% of our Electricity segment revenues from our operations in the U.S. and 31.0% from the rest of the world.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product Segment. In the Product segment, which contributed 7.1% of our total revenues in 2021, we design, manufacture and sell equipment for geothermal and recovered energy-based electricity generation and remote power units and provide services relating to the engineering, procurement and construction of geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants. In 2021, we derived 11.5% of our Product segment revenues from our operations in the United States and 88.5% from the rest of the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Energy Storage Segment. In the Energy Storage segment, which contributed 4.6% of our total revenues in 2021, we own and operate grid connected In Front of the Meter (IFM) BESS facilities, which provide capacity, energy and ancillary services directly to the electric grid. We derived all of our Energy Storage segment revenues from our operations in the United States. In 2021, we commissioned one energy storage facility with a total of 10MW/40 MWh in California and started development and construction of six energy storage projects with a total capacity of 89 MW/124 MWh in California, Texas, New Jersey and Ohio. We plan to accelerate long-term growth in the Energy Storage segment market to establish a leading position in the United States.

Our Power Generation Business (Electricity Segment)
 
Our company-owned power plants include both power plants that we have built and power plants that we have acquired. The substantial majority of the power plants that we currently own or operate produce electricity from geothermal energy sources. Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable and generally sustainable form of energy derived from the natural heat of the earth. Unlike electricity produced by burning fossil fuels, electricity produced from geothermal energy sources is produced without emissions of certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, and with far lower emissions of other pollutants such as carbon dioxide. As a result, electricity produced from geothermal energy sources contributes significantly less to climate change and local and regional incidences of acid rain than energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In addition, compared to power plants that utilize other renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar, geothermal power plants are generally available all year-long and all day-long and can therefore provide base-load electricity services. Geothermal power plants can also be custom built to provide a range of electricity services such as baseload, voltage regulation, reserve and flexible capacity.
 
We own and operate a geothermal and solar PV hybrid project and have similar projects currently under construction, in which the electricity generated from a solar PV power plant is used to offset the equipment’s energy use at the geothermal facility, thus increasing the geothermal energy delivered by the project to the grid.
 
We also construct, own, and operate recovered energy-based power plants. We have built all of the recovered energy-based plants that we operate. Recovered energy comes from residual heat that is generated as a by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations, solar thermal units and a variety of industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing. Such residual heat, which would otherwise be wasted, may be captured in the recovery process and used by recovered energy power plants to generate electricity without burning additional fuel and without additional emissions.
 
Each of our current geothermal power plants sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term, in most of the cases, fixed price PPAs to various counterparties denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar or Euro. These contracts had a total weighted average remaining term, based on contributions to segment revenue, of approximately 15 years at December 31, 2021. In addition, the counterparties to our PPAs in the United States had a credit rating of between A3 to Baa2 by Moody's and BB- to A by S&P. The purchasers of electricity from our foreign power plants are mainly state-owned entities in countries with below investment grade rating.
 
Power Plants in Operation 
 
We own and operate 27 geothermal, REG and solar sites globally with an aggregate generating capacity of 1,012 MW. Geothermal comprises 94% of our generating capacity. In 2021, our geothermal and REG power plants generated at a capacity factor of 86% and 71%, respectively, which is much higher than typical capacity factors for wind and solar producers that are usually at 20% to 30%.

2. | References to generating capacity generally refer to gross generating capacity less auxiliary power. We determine the generating capacity of these power plants by taking into account resource and power plant capabilities. In any given year, the actual power generation of a particular power plant may differ from that power plant’s generating capacity due to variations in ambient temperature, the availability of the geothermal resource, and operational issues affecting performance during that year. In 2021 the capacity factors of Brawley, Olkaria, Puna, Steamboat, Bouillante and Sarulla were significantly impacted by operational and resource issues, as discussed further under “Description of our power plants”.

New Power Plants 
 
We are currently in various stages of construction of new power plants and expansion of existing power plants. Our construction and expansion plans include between 160 MW and 165 MW in generating capacity from geothermal and solar PV power plants in the United States. In addition, we have several geothermal and solar PV projects in the United States, Indonesia, Guatemala and Guadeloupe that are under different stages of construction and development with an aggregate capacity of between 61 MW and 72 MW.
 
    13 

  

We have substantial land positions across 30 prospects in the United States and 11 prospects in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia and New Zealand that we expect will support future geothermal development and on which we have started or plan to start exploration activity. These land positions are comprised of various leases, exploration concessions for geothermal resources and an option to enter into leases.
 
Our Product Segment
 
We design, manufacture and sell products for electricity generation and provide the related services described below. In addition, we are providing cementing services for well drilling to third parties. We primarily manufacture products to fill customer orders, but in some situations, we manufacture products as inventory for future projects that we will own and for future third party projects.
Power Units for Geothermal Power Plants

We design, manufacture and sell power units for geothermal electricity generation, which we refer to as OECs. In geothermal power plants using OECs, geothermal fluid (either hot water, also called brine, or steam or both) is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead to a vaporizer that heats a secondary working fluid, which is vaporized and used to drive the turbine. The secondary fluid is then condensed in a condenser, which may be cooled directly by air through an air cooling system or by water from a cooling tower and sent back to the vaporizer. The cooled geothermal fluid is then reinjected back into the reservoir. Our customers include contractors, geothermal power plant developers, owners and operators.
Power Units for Recovered Energy-Based Power Generation

We design, manufacture and sell power units used to generate electricity from recovered energy, or so-called “waste heat”. This heat is generated as a residual by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations, solar thermal units, biomass facilities and a variety of industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing, and is not otherwise used for any purpose. Our existing and target customers include interstate natural gas pipeline owners and operators, gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators, and other companies engaged in other energy-intensive industrial processes.
 
EPC of Power Plants
 
We serve as an EPC contractor for geothermal and recovered energy power plants on a turnkey basis, using power units we design and manufacture. Our customers are geothermal power plant owners as well as our target customers for the sale of our recovered energy-based power units as described above. Unlike many other companies that provide EPC services, we believe that our competitive advantage is in using equipment that we manufacture allowing us better quality and control over the timing and delivery of required equipment and its related costs.
 
Remote Power Units and Other Generators

We design, manufacture and sell fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with capacities ranging from 200 watts to 5,000 watts, which operate unattended in extreme hot or cold climate conditions. Our customers include contractors who install gas pipelines in remote areas and offshore platform operators and contractors. In addition, we design, manufacture, and sell generators, including heavy duty direct-current generators, for various other uses.
Our Energy Storage Segment
 
Our energy storage segment has grown consistently since 2019 and we expect continuous and even stronger growth over the coming years, while we target the sector as one of our major segments for further investment and growth.
 
In 2021, we successfully brought on line one new Ormat-owned BESS project, the 10 MW/40 MWh Vallecito project in California, which increased our operating portfolio at the end of 2021 to approximately 83 MW / 176 MWh within the footprint of 4 RTOs or ISOs: CAISO, PJM Interconnect, ERCOT and ISONE.
 
We are currently in the process of constructing 7 energy storage projects with a total capacity of 189 MW / 464 MWh in California, Texas, New Jersey and Ohio, with two new projects that were added in early 2022. 
 
    14 

  

In addition, we have an approximately 2.3 GW/5.7 GWh pipeline of potential projects, in different stages of development across the United States that will support our target to reach an energy storage portfolio of between 313MW to 373MW by the end of 2023. The development of such projects is dependent, inter alia, on site permitting, interconnection agreement, supply of Lithium- Ion batteries and economic viability, which are not certain. We plan to continue leveraging our experience in project development and finance, as well as our engineering, procurement and construction know-how and our relationships with utilities and other market participants, to develop additional BESS projects.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy is focused on further developing a geographically balanced portfolio of geothermal, energy storage, solar (PV) and recovered energy assets and continuing our leading position in the geothermal energy market with the objective of becoming a leading global provider of renewable energy. Our strategy focuses on three main elements:

Our Proprietary Technology 
 
Our proprietary technology involves original designs of turbines, pumps, and heat exchangers, as well as formulation of organic motive fluids (all of which are non-ozone-depleting substances) and may be used either in power plants operating according to the ORC alone or in combination with various other commonly used thermodynamic technologies that convert heat to mechanical power, such as gas and steam turbines. It can be used with a variety of thermal energy sources, such as geothermal, recovered energy, biomass, solar energy and fossil fuels. By using advanced computational fluid dynamics techniques and other computer aided design software as well as our test facilities, we continuously seek to improve power plant components, reduce operations and maintenance costs, and increase the range of our equipment and applications. We are always examining ways to increase the output of our plants by utilizing evaporative cooling, cold reinjection, configuration optimization, and topping turbines.
 
We also developed, patented and constructed GCCU power plants in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in a vaporizer of a binary plant, which produces additional power. Our Geothermal Combined Cycle technology is depicted in the diagram below.
 


In the conversion of geothermal energy into electricity, our technology has a number of advantages over conventional geothermal steam turbine plants. A conventional geothermal steam turbine plant consumes significant quantities of water, causing depletion of the aquifer and requiring cooling water treatment with chemicals and consequently a need for the disposal of such chemicals. A conventional geothermal steam turbine plant also creates a significant visual impact in the form of an emitted plume from the cooling towers, especially during cold weather. By contrast, our binary and combined cycle geothermal power plants have a low profile with minimal visual impact and do not emit a plume when they use air-cooled condensers. Our binary and combined cycle geothermal power plants reinject all of the geothermal fluids utilized in the respective processes into the geothermal reservoir. Consequently, such processes generally have no emissions.
 
Other advantages of our technology include simplicity of operation and maintenance and higher yearly availability. For instance, the OEC employs a low speed and high efficiency organic vapor turbine directly coupled to the generator, eliminating the need for reduction gear. In addition, with our binary design, there is no contact between the turbine blade and geothermal fluids, which can often be very erosive and corrosive. Instead, the geothermal fluids pass through a heat exchanger, which is less susceptible to erosion and can adapt much better to corrosive fluids. In addition, with the organic vapor condensed above atmospheric pressure, no vacuum system is required.
 
    18 

  

We use the same elements of our technology in our recovered energy products. The heat source may be exhaust gases from a Brayton cycle gas turbine, low-pressure steam, or medium temperature liquid found in the process industries such as oil refining and cement manufacturing. In most cases, we attach an additional heat exchanger in which we circulate thermal oil or water to transfer the heat into the OEC’s own vaporizer in order to provide greater operational flexibility and control. Once this stage of each recovery is completed, the rest of the operation is identical to that of the OECs used in our geothermal power plants and enjoys the same advantages of using the ORC. In addition, our technology allows for better load following than conventional steam turbines, requires no water treatment (since it is air cooled and organic fluid motivated), and does not require the continuous presence of a licensed steam boiler operator on site.
 
Our REG technology is depicted in the diagram below.
 

Patents 
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have 75 issued U.S. patents and five pending U.S. patent application. These patents and patent applications cover our products (mainly power units based on the ORC) and systems (mainly geothermal power plants and industrial waste heat recovery plants for electricity production). The product-related patents cover components that include turbines, heat exchangers, air coolers, seals and controls as well as control of operation of geothermal production well pumps. The system-related patents cover not only particular components but also the overall energy conversion system from the “fuel supply” (e.g., geothermal fluid, waste heat, biomass or solar) to electricity production.
 
The system-related patents also cover subjects such as waste heat recovery related to gas pipeline compressors and industrial waste heat, solar power systems, disposal of non-condensable gases present in geothermal fluids, reinjection of other geothermal fluids ensuring geothermal resource sustainability, power plants for very high-pressure geothermal resources, two-phase fluids, low temperature geothermal brine as well as processes related to EGS. 55 of our patents cover combined cycle geothermal power plants, in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in a vaporizer of a binary plant, which produces additional power. The remaining terms of our issued patents range from one year to 16 years. The loss of any single patent would not have a material effect on our business or results of operations.
 
Research and Development 
 
We conduct research and development activities intended to improve plant performance, reduce costs, and increase the breadth of our product offerings. The primary focus of our research and development efforts is targeting power plant conceptual thermodynamic cycle and major equipment including continued performance, cost and land usage improvements to our condensing equipment, and development of new higher efficiency and higher power output turbines and brine production pumps. New realms for innovation include implementation of predictive maintenance software and automation of power plants performance analysis.
 
    19 

  

We also devote resources to research and development related to our energy storage segment. Our engineering and R&D teams are working to optimize the dispatch strategy of a battery energy storage system (BESS), develop and deploy capabilities to self-integrate BESS and test different battery cell and inverter technologies under simulated operating criteria of various energy markets to allow us to bring to market cost-effective BESS more rapidly and more optimized to the specific use cases and target revenue streams. Additionally, we are continuing to evaluate investment opportunities in companies with innovative technology or product offerings for renewable energy and energy storage solutions.
 
Market Opportunities 
 
Geothermal Market Opportunities 
 
Renewable energy provides a sustainable alternative to the existing solutions to two major global issues: climate change and diminishing fossil fuel reserves. Renewable energy is sustainable, clean and decarbonizes the grid. These environmental benefits have led major countries to focus their efforts on the development of renewable energy sources in general and geothermal specifically.
 
Based on data provided by ThinkGeo Energy in January 2022, the total installed geothermal power generation capacity at year-end 2021 stood at 15,854 MW, an increase of 246 MW over 2020. The leading countries are the U.S., Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, Mexico and New Zealand. The largest growth in 2021 happened in Indonesia, which had an addition of 143 MW with two new power plants, followed by Chile and Turkey.
 
Having realized the importance of renewable energy including geothermal alternatives, various governments have been preparing regulatory frameworks and policies, and providing incentives to develop the sector.

Interest in geothermal energy in the United States continues to grow based on supportive legislation and regulation at the local, state, and federal levels. Policy makers and regulators are becoming increasingly aware of the comparatively high value of geothermal energy in contrast to intermittent renewable technology, and this is readily apparent through individual state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) goals (as described below) accounting for more baseload energy than ever before as coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants reach retirement.
 
Today, electricity generation from geothermal resources is concentrated mainly in California, Nevada, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, and we believe there are opportunities for expansion in other states such as New Mexico due to the potential of its geothermal resources and recent legislation that has increased its renewable energy goals to 100% by 2045 for investor-owned utilities.
 
Geothermal energy provides numerous benefits to the U.S. grid and economy. Geothermal development and operation bring economic benefits in the form of tax incentives and long term high-paying jobs, and it currently has one of the lowest LCOE of all power sources in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's report published in February 2019. Additionally, improvements in geothermal production make it possible to provide ancillary and on-demand services. This helps load serving entities avoid additional costs from purchasing and then balancing intermittent resources with storage or new transmission.
 
At the end of 2020, the United States Congress passed its most significant energy legislation in over a decade as part of the omnibus spending and coronavirus relief package. The legislation includes a budget for the Geothermal Technology Office to support geothermal research and development, a one-year extension of the production tax credit, and specific language to improve permitting efforts for renewable projects on federal land.

State level legislation
 
Many state governments have enacted an RPS program under which utilities are required to include renewable energy sources as part of their energy generation portfolio. Under an RPS, participating states have set targets for the production of their energy from renewable sources with specific deadlines. Renewable energy generation under an RPS program is tracked through the production of RECs. Load serving entities track the RECs to ensure they are meeting the mandate prescribed by the RPS.
 
Currently in the United States, 42 states plus the District of Colombia and four territories have enacted an RPS, renewable portfolio goals, or similar laws or incentives (such as clean energy standards or goals) requiring or encouraging load serving entities in such states to generate or buy a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable energy or recovered heat sources. The vast majority of Ormat’s geothermal projects can be found in California, Nevada, and Hawaii which have some of the most stringent RPS programs in the country.
 
We see the impact of RPS and climate legislation as the most significant driver for us to expand existing power plants and to build new renewable projects.
 
States also provide incentives to geothermal energy producers. Nevada provides a property tax abatement of up to 55% for real and tangible personal property used to generate electricity from geothermal sources. The abatement may extend up to twenty years if certain job creation requirements are met. The California Energy Commission provides favorable grants and loans to promote the development of new or existing geothermal resources and technologies within the state. In Idaho, geothermal energy producers are exempt from property tax and, in lieu, pay a tax of 3% of gross energy earnings. Also in California, in its recent ruling, the CPUC requiring Electric Load Service Entities (LSEs) to procure 11.5 GW of new clean electricity by 2026, 1 GW of this procurement must deliver firm power with an 80% capacity factor, produce zero on-site emissions, and be weather independent. With a high capacity factor and firm and flexible generation, geothermal energy addresses these requirements and is the natural replacement for baseload fossil fuels and nuclear generation.
 
Global

We believe the global markets continue to present growth and expansion opportunities in both established and emerging markets.
 
Operations outside of the United States may be subject to and/or benefit from increasing efforts by governments and businesses around the world to fight climate change and move towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. According to a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency entitled Toward 100% Renewable Energy, in 2019, a total of 61 countries had set a 100% renewable energy target in at least one end-use sector, up from 60 countries in 2018.
 
We believe that several global initiatives will create business expansion opportunities for us internationally and support global growth of the renewable sector, such as: the historic Paris Agreement approved by the Twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on December 12, 2015, which committed parties to the agreement to set nationally determined efforts with the view to strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change and reporting on their progress; the Mission Innovation, pursuant to which 22 countries and the European Commission have pledged to double their respective budgets for renewable energy technology over five years, increasing investments by $4.9 billion annually since its inception in 2015; and the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, among others. Following the Paris Agreement, the EIB and other multilateral institutions committed to provide $100 billion of new financing for climate action projects over the next five years to assist countries in reaching their targets, and in 2021, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) brought together 120 world leaders to set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade. It was agreed, among other things, that countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of CO2 to keep temperature rises within 1.5˚C.
 
Outside of the United States, the majority of power generating capacity has historically been owned and controlled by governments. Since the early 1990s, however, many foreign governments have privatized their power generation industries through sales to third parties encouraging new capacity development and/or refurbishment of existing assets by independent power developers. These foreign governments have taken a variety of approaches to encourage the development of competitive power markets, including awarding long-term contracts for energy and capacity to independent power generators and creating competitive wholesale markets for selling and trading energy, capacity, and related products. Some foreign regions and countries have also adopted active government programs designed to encourage clean renewable energy power generation such as the following countries in which we operate, sell products and/or are conducting business development activities:
 
    21 

  

Europe
 
Europe has the fourth largest geothermal power capacity, the majority of which stems from Italy and Turkey and recently small scale projects in Germany. A significant part of our European operations is in Turkey. We are looking for opportunities to expand in Europe mostly in the Product segment.
 
A significant part of our European operations is in Turkey, which, until recently, was the fastest growing geothermal market worldwide with the theoretical potential for 31 GW of geothermal capacity and with a proven geothermal capacity of 4.5 GW, according to the Turkish Mineral Technical Exploration Agency. Since 2004, we have established strong business relationships in the Turkish geothermal market and provided our wide range of solutions including our binary systems, to over 40 geothermal power plants with a total capacity of approximately 950 MW. The potential for geothermal growth in Turkey is still high, specifically in center-south and east areas of the country, however, due to the economic crisis in Turkey, there has been a practical stop of new projects and investments.
 
Latin America
 
Several Latin American countries have renewable energy programs and pursue the development of the geothermal market.
 
In Guatemala, where our Zunil and Amatitlan power plants are located, the government approved and adopted the Energy Policy 2013-2027 that secures, among other things, a supply of electricity at competitive prices by diversifying the energy mix with an 80% renewable energy share target for 2027.
 
In Honduras, where we operate our Platanares power plant, the government set a target to reach at least 80% renewable energy production by 2034.
 
New Zealand
 
In New Zealand, where we have been actively providing geothermal power plant solutions since 1988, the government’s policies to fight climate change include a net zero GHG emissions reduction target  by 2050 and a renewable electricity generation target of 90% of New Zealand’s total electricity generation by 2035. We continue selling power plants and products to our New Zealand customers and our cooperate with other potential customers for adding geothermal power generation capacity within the coming years.
Asia
 
Indonesia has become an important geothermal market for Ormat to expand its core business, due to its significant potential for future development, financial strength (rated at BBB by S&P and Baa2 by Moody's) and active geothermal industry that is supported by regulatory incentives. The government intends to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix, aiming to meet a target of 29% of domestic energy demand by 2025. In addition to two joint venture projects in Indonesia, we are advancing drilling in two prospects, Toca Tindung (formerly known as Bitung) and Wapsalit. We are also pursuing various supply opportunities in Indonesia, and in other countries in Southeast Asia, and in China, where we supplied our equipment to one of our clients’ geothermal projects, and Japan, which has the third largest potential geothermal output in the world at 23,470 MW and the ninth largest installed capacity. In March 2021, China’s National Energy Administration adopted the 14th Renewable Energy Development Five Year Plan that seeks to increase the share of non-fossil fuel energy in total primary energy consumption to 20% by 2030, among other goals. In October 2021, the Japanese Cabinet approved the Sixth Strategic Energy Plan targeting the ratio of renewable energy to total power generation in 2030 of 36% to 38%, up from 22% to 24% under the previous Plan in 2018. State-owned resources agency JOGMEC started conducting test bores as part of the financially risky early phase of development on behalf of potential developers beginning in the fiscal year from April 2020. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) determined 22 successful applicants for the full year 2020 Research Project for Developing Resources for Geothermal Power Generation, managed by State-owned resources agency JOGMEC.
 
    22 

  

East Africa
 
In East Africa the geothermal potential along the Rift Valley is estimated at several thousand MW. The different countries along the Rift Valley are at different stages of development of their respective geothermal potential.
 
In Kenya, there are already several geothermal power plants, including our 150 MW Olkaria III complex. The Kenyan government has identified the country's untapped geothermal potential as the most suitable indigenous source of electricity.
 
While the Kenyan government is aiming to reach 10 GW of power generating capacity by 2037, under the Least-Cost Power Development Plan 2017-37, which had a target of 62% of such capacity generated from renewable energy sources (including large hydro and solar), a Task Force was appointed by Kenya's president to review and analyze PPAs entered into between various independent power producers and the local utility, and their recommendation at this stage is to reconsider new PPAs and review all new development in the country.
 
Energy Storage 
 
Globally, there is a continued increase in the use of renewable energy. In the United States and Europe, this increase is placing strains on the electric grid as adding wind and solar PV power creates situations where a significant amount of power plant capacity must be available to ramp up and down to accommodate these intermittent resource’s daily output cycles and variations due to weather conditions. Furthermore, the output from wind and solar PV power plants can change significantly over short periods of time due to environmental conditions like cloud movement and fog burn off and can cause instability on the electric grid. As a result, energy storage is positioned to become a key component of the grid.
 
Energy storage systems utilize surplus, available electricity that enables utilities and grid operators to optimize the operation of the grid, run generators closer to full capacity for longer periods, and operate the grid more efficiently and effectively. As penetration of wind and solar resources increases, so does the need for services that energy storage systems can provide to “balance the grid”, such as local capacity, frequency regulation, ramping, reactive power, black start and movement of energy from times of excess supply to times of high demand. Common applications for energy storage systems include ancillary services, wind/solar smoothing, energy trading, peaker replacement, and transmission and distribution deferral.
 
According to Wood Mackenzie's Energy Storage Monitor for Q3 2021, approximately 1.1 GW/3.5 GWh of new energy storage projects were installed in the United States as of Q3 2021 and this number represents a 135%/349% increase compared to Q3 2020. Wood Mackenzie is forecasting that annual energy storage deployments will grow to 37GWh by 2025.
 
2021 saw record growth in BESS deployment in the United States and significant growth in BESS deployment is expected to continue primarily for grid-connected (also referred to as “in front of the meter”) applications. Many power systems are also undergoing significant challenges and changes such as grid aging, grid congestion, retirement of aging generators, implementation of greenhouse gas emission reduction rules and increasing penetration of variable renewable energy resources.
 
We own and operate several grid-connected BESS facilities, where revenues are derived from selling energy, capacity and/or ancillary services in merchant markets like PJM Interconnect, ISO New England, the ERCOT and the CAISO. We are pursuing the development of additional grid-connected BESS projects in multiple regions, with expected revenues coming from providing energy, capacity and/or ancillary services on a merchant basis,or through bilateral contracts with load serving entities, e.g. investor owned utilities, publicly owned utilities and community choice aggregators. We are also pursuing the development of storage plus Solar PV facilities.
 
Solar PV

The solar PV market continues to grow, driven by a decline in equipment prices and an increasing desire to replace conventional generation with renewable resources that are commonly supported by favorable regulatory policies.  We are monitoring market drivers with the potential to develop solar PV power plants in locations where we can offer competitively priced power generation. Our current focus is in adding solar PV systems in some of our operating geothermal power plants to reduce internal consumption loads, as well as developing solar PV and BESS projects in targeted regions where economics are favorable. In 2019 we successfully placed in service a solar PV augmentation system at our Tungsten Mountain geothermal power plant in Churchill County, Nevada and we are currently constructing projects adjacent to some of our geothermal power plants in Nevada. We are also currently constructing the 20 MW(AC) Wister solar PV project in Imperial County, California, for which a power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric is in effect and we are currently targeting commercial operation in the second half of 2022.

Other Opportunities 
 
Recovered Energy Generation 
 
In addition to our geothermal power generation activities, we are pursuing recovered energy-based power generation opportunities in the United States and worldwide. We believe recovered energy-based power generation will ultimately benefit from the efforts to reduce GHG emissions. We have built 23 power plants in North America which generate electricity utilizing “waste heat” from gas turbine-driven compressor stations along interstate natural gas pipelines, from midstream and gas processing facilities, and from other applications.
 
Several states, and to some extent the federal government, have recognized the environmental benefits of recovered energy-based power generation. For example, according to trade association data, 20 states currently include waste heat to power facilities in their renewable portfolio standard, efficiency standard, or similar program. In addition, California modified the Self Generation Incentive Program to allow recovered energy-based power generation to qualify for a per watt incentive.
 
At the end of 2020, the United States Congress passed legislation including a provision that makes recovered energy generation property eligible for the energy investment tax credit. Recovered energy property that begins construction in 2021 or 2022 is eligible for a 26 percent tax credit, and property that begins construction in 2023 is eligible for a 22 percent tax credit.
 
In 2016, the Canadian government ratified its commitments in the Paris Agreement, which features a commitment to reduce emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. In July 2021, Pursuant to the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, Canadian provinces must have an emission reduction plan in place or be subject to a federal carbon tax in 2018.Canada updated its commitment under the agreement to reduce emissions by 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030.
 
Canada’s comprehensive climate policy, once fully implemented, will encourage the development of renewable energy technologies, including waste heat recovery, throughout the country. We believe that Europe and other markets worldwide may offer similar opportunities in recovered energy-based power generation.
 
In summary, the market for the recovery of waste heat converted into electricity exists either when already available electricity is expensive or where the regulatory environment facilitates construction and marketing of power generated from recovered waste heat. However, such projects tend to be smaller than 9 MW and we expect any growth to be relatively slow and geographically scattered.
 
Operations of our Electricity Segment 
 
How We Own Our Power Plants
 
We customarily establish a separate subsidiary to own interests in each of our power plants. This ensures that the power plant, and the revenues generated by it, will be the only source for repaying indebtedness, if any, incurred to finance the construction or the acquisition (or to refinance the construction or acquisition) of the relevant power plant. If we do not own all of the interest in a power plant, we enter into a shareholders’ agreement or a partnership agreement that governs the management of the specific subsidiary and our relationship with our partner in connection with the specific power plant. Our ability to transfer or sell our interests in certain power plants may be restricted by certain purchase options or rights of first refusal in favor of our power plant partners or the power plant’s power purchasers and/or certain change of control and assignment restrictions in the underlying power plant and financing documents. All of our domestic geothermal and REG power plants are Qualifying Facilities under the PURPA and are eligible for regulatory exemptions from most provisions of the FPA and certain state laws and regulations.

How We Explore and Evaluate Geothermal Resources
 
We conduct our exploration activities in the United States and internationally. It generally takes two to three years from the time we start active exploration of a particular geothermal resource to the time we have an operating production well, assuming we conclude the resource is commercially viable and determine to pursue its development. Exploration activities generally involve the phases described below.
Initial Evaluation
 
We identify and evaluate potential geothermal resources by sampling and studying new areas combined with information available from public and private sources.
 
Our initial evaluation is usually conducted by our own staff, although we might engage outside service providers for some tasks from time to time. The costs associated with an initial evaluation vary from site to site, based on various factors, including the acreage involved and the costs, if any, of obtaining information from private databases or other sources. On average, our expenses for an initial evaluation range from approximately $10,000 (mainly in the U.S.) to $50,000 (mainly in the international prospects) including travel, chemical analyses, and data acquisition. 
 
If we conclude, based on the information considered in the initial evaluation, that the geothermal resource could support a commercially viable power plant, taking into account various factors described below, we proceed to land rights acquisition.
 
Land Acquisition
 
We acquire land rights to any geothermal resources our initial evaluation indicates could potentially support a commercially viable power plant. For domestic power plants, we either lease or own the sites on which our power plants are located. For our foreign power plants, our lease rights for the power plant site are generally contained in the terms of a concession agreement or other contract with the host government or an agency thereof. In certain cases, we also enter into one or more geothermal resource leases (or subleases) or a concession or an option agreement or other agreement granting us the exclusive right to extract geothermal resources from specified areas of land, with the owners (or sublessors) of such land.
 
For most of our current exploration sites in the United States, we acquire rights to use the geothermal resource through land leases with the BLM (which regulates leasehold interests in U.S. federal land), with various states, or through private leases. A summary of our typical lease terms is provided below under “Description of our Leases and Lands”. The up-front bonus and royalty payments vary from site to site and are based on, among other things, current market conditions.
 
Surveys
 
We conduct geological, geochemical, and/or geophysical surveys on the site we acquire. These surveys are conducted incrementally considering relative impact and cost, and the geologic model is updated continuously.
 
We make a further determination of the commercial viability of the geothermal resource based on the results of this process, particularly the results of the geochemical surveys estimating temperature and the overall geologic model, including potential resource size. If the results from the geochemical surveys are poor (i.e., low derived resource temperatures or poor permeability) or the geologic model indicates small or deep resource, we re-evaluate the commercial viability of the geothermal resource and may not proceed to exploratory drilling. We generally only move forward with those sites that we believe have a high probability of successful development.
 
Exploratory Drilling
 
We drill one or more exploratory wells on the high priority, relatively low risk sites to confirm and/or define the geothermal resource. Each year we determine and approve an exploration budget for the entire exploration activity in such year. We prioritize budget allocation between the various geothermal sites based on commercial and geological factors. The costs we incur for exploratory drilling vary from site to site based on various factors, including the accessibility of the drill site, the geology of the site, and the depth of the resource. However, on average, exploration costs, prior to drilling of a full-size well are approximately $1.0 million to $3.0 million for each site, not including land acquisition. We only reach such spending levels for sites that proved to be successful in the early stages of exploration.
 
    25 

  

At various points during our exploration activities, we re-assess whether the geothermal resource involved will support a commercially viable power plant based on information available at that time.
 
If we conclude that the geothermal resource involved will support a commercially viable power plant, we proceed to constructing a power plant at the site.
 
How We Construct Our Power Plants. 
 
The principal phases involved in constructing one of our geothermal power plants are as follows:
 

• | Drilling production and injection wells. We consider completing the drilling of the first production well to be the beginning of our construction phase for a power plant. However, this is not always sufficient for a full release of a project for construction. The number of production wells varies from plant to plant depending on, among other things, the geothermal resource, the projected capacity of the power plant, the power generation equipment to be used and the way geothermal fluids will be re-injected through injection wells to maintain the geothermal resource and surface conditions. We generally drill the wells ourselves although in some cases we use outside contractors. The cost for each production and injection well varies depending on, among other things, the depth and size of the well and market conditions affecting the supply and demand for drilling equipment, labor and operators. In the last five years, our typical cost for each production and injection well ranges between $2.5 million to $10 million. A typical cost for a domestic well is approximately $3.3 million and $7.3 million for international wells.

• | Designing the well field, power plant, equipment, controls, and transmission facilities. We usually use our own employees to design the well field and the power plant, including equipment that we manufacture and that will be needed for the power plant. In some cases, depending on complexity and location, we use third parties to help us with the design. The designs vary based on various factors, including local laws, required permits, the geothermal resource, the expected capacity of the power plant and the way geothermal fluids will be re-injected to maintain the geothermal resource and surface conditions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtaining any required permits, electrical interconnection and transmission agreements. We use our own employees and from time to time, depending on complexity and location, outside consultants to obtain any required permits and licenses for our power plants that are not already covered by the terms of our site leases. The permits and licenses required vary from site to site and are described below under “Environmental Permits”.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing (or in the case of equipment we do not manufacture ourselves, purchasing) the equipment required for the power plant. Generally, we manufacture most of the power generating unit equipment we use at our power plants. Multiple sources of supply are generally available for all other equipment we do not manufacture.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assembling and constructing the well field, power plant, transmission facilities, and related facilities. We use our own employees to manage the construction work. For site grading, civil, mechanical, and electrical work we use subcontractors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In recent years, it has taken us two to three years from the time we drill a production well until the power plant becomes operational. During 2021, in the Electricity segment, we focused on the commencement of operations at McGinness Hills Expansion in Nevada, the construction of Mammoth CD-4 plant and the construction of Tungsten Mountain Enhancement. We also began construction of North Valley power plant and Heber 2 repower as well as with enhancement work in some other of our operating power plants worldwide.
 
When deciding whether to continue holding lease rights and/or to pursue exploration activity, we diligently prioritize our prospective investments, taking into account resource and probability assessments in order to make informed decisions about whether a particular project will support commercial operation. 
 
    26 

  

We may conclude that a respective geothermal resources will not support commercial operations and therefore costs associated with exploration activities at this site will be expensed accordingly under the Write-off of Unsuccessful Exploration Activities line item in the consolidated statements of operations in or financial statements.
 
How We Operate and Maintain Our Power Plants 
 
Our operations and maintenance practices are designed to minimize operating costs without compromising safety or environmental standards while maximizing plant flexibility and maintaining high reliability. Our operations and maintenance practices for geothermal power plants seek to preserve the sustainable characteristics of the geothermal resources we use to produce electricity and maintain steady-state operations within the constraints of those resources reflected in our relevant geologic and hydrologic studies. Our approach to plant management emphasizes the operational autonomy of our individual plant or complex managers and staff to identify and resolve operations and maintenance issues at their respective power plants; however, each power plant or complex draws upon our available collective resources and experience, and that of our subsidiaries. We have organized our operations such that inventories, maintenance, backup, and other operational functions are pooled within each power plant complex and provided by one operation and maintenance provider. This approach enables us to realize cost savings and enhances our ability to meet our power plant availability goals. 
 
Safety is a key area of concern to us. We believe that the most efficient and profitable performance of our power plants can only be accomplished within a safe working environment for our employees. Our compensation and incentive program includes safety as a factor in evaluating our employees, and we have a well-developed reporting system to track safety and environmental incidents, if any, at our power plants.
 
How We Sell Electricity 
 
In the United States, the purchasers of power ally from our power plants are typically investor-owned electric utility companies or electric cooperatives including public owned utilities, and recently we signed a PPA with CCAs. Outside of the United States, our purchasers are either state-owned utilities or privately-owned-entities and we typically operate our facilities under rights granted to us by a governmental agency pursuant to a concession agreement. In each case, we enter into long-term contracts (typically, PPAs) for the sale of electricity or the conversion of geothermal resources into electricity. Although previously our power plants’ revenues under a PPA generally consisted of two payments, energy payments and capacity payments, our recent PPAs provide for energy payments only. Energy payments are normally based on a power plant’s electrical output actually delivered to the purchaser measured in kWh, with payment rates either fixed or indexed to the power purchaser’s “avoided” power costs (i.e., the costs the power purchaser would have incurred itself had it produced the power it is purchasing from third parties) or rates that escalate at a predetermined percentage each year. Capacity payments are normally calculated based on the generating capacity or the declared capacity of a power plant available for delivery to the purchaser, regardless of the amount of electrical output actually produced or delivered. In addition, we have four domestic power plants located in California, Nevada and Hawaii that are eligible for capacity payments under the respective PPAs upon reaching certain levels of generation, or subject to a capacity payment reduction if certain levels of generation are not reached.
How We Finance Our Power Plants 
 
Historically we have funded our power plants with different sources of liquidity such as a non-recourse or limited recourse debt, lease financing, tax monetization transactions, internally generated cash, which includes funds from operations, as well as proceeds from loans under corporate credit facilities, public equity offerings, senior unsecured corporate bonds, and the sale of equity interests and other securities. Such leveraged financing permits the development of power plants with a limited amount of equity contributions, but also increases the risk that a reduction in cashflow could adversely affect a particular power plant’s ability to meet its debt obligations. Leveraged financing also means that distributions of dividends or other distributions by our power plant subsidiaries to us are contingent on compliance with financial and other covenants contained in the applicable finance documents.
 
    27 

  

In 2021, we raised several corporate loans and expanded and renewed our revolving credit facilities to support our geothermal and storage growth.
 
We have used financing structures to monetize PTCs and depreciation, such as our tax equity partnership transaction involving McGinness Hills phase 3, Tungsten and Steamboat Hills Repowering Project. Our Dixie Valley project, acquired from Terra-Gen in 2021, has a leveraged lease financing arrangement.
 
We have also used a sale of equity interests in three of our geothermal assets and nine of our REG facilities to fund corporate needs including funding for the construction of new projects. We may use some of the same financing structures in the future. 
 
How We Mitigate International Political Risk. 
 
We generally purchase insurance policies to cover our book equity exposure to certain political risks involved in operating in developing countries, as described below under “Insurance”. However, insurance may not cover all political risks or coverage amounts may not be sufficient.
Description of Our Leases and Lands 
 
We have domestic leases on approximately 355,973 acres of federal, state, and private land in California, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Idaho and Oregon. The approximate breakdown between federal, state and private leases and owned land is as follows:
 

• | 76% of the acreage under our control is leased from the U.S. government, acting mainly through the BLM;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% is leased or subleased from private landowners and/or leaseholders;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3% is owned by us; and
--+-----------------------


• | 1% is leased from various states.
--+----------------------------------

 
Each of the leases within each of the categories above has standard terms and requirements, as summarized below. Internationally, our land position includes approximately 60,903 acres.
 
BLM Geothermal Leases
 
Certain of our domestic project subsidiaries have entered into geothermal resources leases with the U.S. government, pursuant to which they have obtained the right to conduct their geothermal development and operations on federally-owned land. These leases are made pursuant to the Geothermal Steam Act and the lessor under such leases is the U.S. government, acting through the BLM.
 
BLM geothermal leases grant the geothermal lessee the right and privilege to drill for, extract, produce, remove, utilize, sell, and dispose of geothermal resources on certain lands, together with the right to build and maintain necessary improvements thereon. The actual ownership of the geothermal resources and other minerals beneath the land is retained in the federal mineral estate. The geothermal lease does not grant to the geothermal lessee the exclusive right to develop the lands, although the geothermal lessee does hold the exclusive right to develop geothermal resources within the lands. Since BLM leases do not grant to the geothermal lessee the exclusive right to use the surface of the land, BLM may grant rights to others for activities that do not unreasonably interfere with the geothermal lessee’s uses of the same land, including use, off-road vehicles, and/or wind or solar energy developments.
 
Typical BLM leases issued to geothermal lessees before August 8, 2005 have a primary term of ten years and will renew so long as geothermal resources are being produced or utilized in commercial quantities but cannot exceed a period of forty years after the end of the primary term. If at the end of the forty-year period geothermal steam is still being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the geothermal lessee will have a preferential right to renew the lease for a second forty-year term, under terms and conditions as the BLM deems appropriate.
 
    28 

  

BLM leases issued after August 8, 2005 have a primary term of ten years. If the geothermal lessee does not reach commercial production within the primary term, the BLM may grant two five-year extensions. If the lessee is drilling a well for the purposes of commercial production, the lease may be extended for five years and thereafter, as long as steam is being produced and used in commercial quantities, the lease may be extended for up to thirty-five years. If, at the end of the extended thirty-five-year term, geothermal steam is still being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the geothermal lessee will have a preferential right to renew the lease under terms and conditions as the BLM deems appropriate.
 
For BLM leases issued before August 8, 2005, the geothermal lessee is required to pay an annual rental fee (on a per acre basis), which escalates according to a schedule described therein, until production of geothermal steam in commercial quantities has commenced. After such production has commenced, the geothermal lessee is required to pay royalties (on a monthly basis) on the amount or value of (i) steam, (ii) by-products derived from production, and (iii) commercially de-mineralized water sold or utilized by the project (or reasonably susceptible to such sale or use).
 
For BLM leases issued after August 8, 2005, (i) a geothermal lessee who has obtained a lease through a non-competitive bidding process will pay an annual rental fee equal to $1.00 per acre for the first ten years and $5.00 per acre each year thereafter; and (ii) a geothermal lessee who has obtained a lease through a competitive process will pay a rental equal to $2.00 per acre for the first year, $3.00 per acre for the second through tenth year and $5.00 per acre each year thereafter. Rental fees paid before the first day of the year for which the rental is owed will be credited towards royalty payments for that year. For BLM leases issued, effective, or pending on August 5, 2005 or thereafter, royalty rates are fixed between 1.0-2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity during the first ten years of production under the lease. The royalty rate set by the BLM for geothermal resources produced for the commercial generation of electricity but not sold in an arm’s length transaction is 1.75% for the first ten years of production and 3.5% thereafter. The royalty rate for geothermal resources sold by the geothermal lessee or an affiliate in an arm’s length transaction is 10.0% of the gross proceeds from the arm’s length sale.
 
In the event of a default under any BLM lease, or the failure to comply with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or regulations issued under the Geothermal Steam Act or the terms or stipulations of the lease, the BLM may, 30 days after notice of default is provided to the relevant project, (i) suspend operations until the requested action is taken, or (ii) cancel the lease.
 
Private Geothermal Leases
 
Certain of our domestic project subsidiaries have entered into geothermal resources leases with private parties, pursuant to which they have obtained the right to conduct their geothermal development and operations on privately owned land. In many cases, the lessor under these private geothermal leases owns only the geothermal resource and not the surface of the land.
 
Typically, the leases grant our project subsidiaries the exclusive right and privilege to drill for, produce, extract, take and remove from the leased land water, brine, steam, steam power, minerals (other than oil), salts, chemicals, gases (other than gases associated with oil), and other products produced or extracted by such project subsidiary. The project subsidiaries are also granted certain non-exclusive rights pertaining to the construction and operation of plants, structures, and facilities on the leased land. Additionally, the project subsidiaries are granted the right to dispose geothermal fluid as well as the right to re-inject into the leased land water, brine, steam, and gases in a well or wells for the purpose of maintaining or restoring pressure in the productive zones beneath the leased land or other land in the vicinity. Because the private geothermal leases do not grant to the lessee the exclusive right to use the surface of the land, the lessor reserves the right to conduct other activities on the leased land in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the geothermal lessee’s uses of the same land, which other activities may include agricultural use (farming or grazing), recreational use and hunting, and/or wind or solar energy developments.
 
The leases provide for a term consisting of a primary term in the range of five to 30 years, depending on the lease, and so long thereafter as lease products are being produced or the project subsidiary is engaged in drilling, extraction, processing, or reworking operations on the leased land.
 
    29 

  

As consideration under most of our project subsidiaries’ private leases, the project subsidiary must pay to the lessor a certain specified percentage of the value “at the well” (which is not attributable to the enhanced value of electricity generation), gross proceeds, or gross revenues of all lease products produced, saved, and sold on a monthly basis. In certain of our project subsidiaries’ private leases, royalties payable to the lessor by the project subsidiary are based on the gross revenues received by the lessee from the sale or use of the geothermal substances, either from electricity production or the value of the geothermal resource “at the well”.
 
In addition, pursuant to the leases, the project subsidiary typically agrees to commence drilling, extraction or processing operations on the leased land within the primary term, and to conduct such operations with reasonable diligence until lease products have been found, extracted and processed in quantities deemed “paying quantities” by the project subsidiary, or until further operations would, in such project subsidiary’s judgment, be unprofitable or impracticable. The project subsidiary has the right at any time within the primary term to terminate the lease and surrender the relevant land. If the project subsidiary has not commenced any such operations on said land (or on the unit area, if the lease has been unitized), or terminated the lease within the primary term, the project subsidiary must pay to the lessor, in order to maintain its lease position, annually in advance, a rental fee until operations are commenced on the leased land.
 
If the project subsidiary fails to pay any installment of royalty or rental when due and if such default continues for a period of fifteen days specified in the lease, for example, after its receipt of written notice thereof from the lessor, then at the option of the lessor, the lease will terminate as to the portion or portions thereof as to which the project subsidiary is in default. If the project subsidiary defaults in the performance of any obligations under the lease, other than a payment default, and if, for a period of 90 days after written notice is given to it by the lessor of such default, the project subsidiary fails to commence and thereafter diligently and in good faith take remedial measures to remedy such default, the lessor may terminate the lease.
 
We do not regard any property that we lease as material unless and until we begin construction of a power plant on the property, that is, until we drill a production well on the property.

(1) Don A. Campbell is experiencing cooling since mid-2016, with 6°F in recent years, that is reducing its generating capacity. Injection tests and tracer studies, along with reservoir modeling have been used to develop a plan to mitigate temperature decline of the reservoir. Temperature mitigation program is ongoing. New production and injection wells are scheduled for early 2022.
 
(2) Indirectly owned 36.75% by Northleaf.
 
(3) We are currently in the process of enhancing the Heber 1 and Heber 2 power plants as discussed below.
 
(4) In  2021, we  signed a 15-year PPA with the CPA for our Heber South power plant. Under the terms of the agreement, effective January 1, 2022, CPA started to purchase 14 MW from the facility located in Imperial Valley, CA. The PPA replaces the original PPA with SCPPA, which had a shorter remaining duration and was subject to an early termination option. This is Ormat’s first contract with CPA, creating the potential for additional agreements in the future as CPA pursues aggressive goals to provide renewable energy to southern California.
 
    32 

  

(5) Under the Heber 2 PPA with SCE, that expires in mid-2023, the parties have six months' notice termination right that we used and sent a termination notice to SCE. We are currently negotiating a new long-term PPA for the project following a request for bid we issued in 2021.
 
(6)Owned 40% by Enbridge Inc. Upgrades to the power plant were completed in 2020.
 
(7) Continued workover in Ormesa to maintain production.
 
(8)On May 3, 2018, the Kilauea volcano located in close proximity to our Puna 38 MW geothermal power plant in the Puna district of Hawaii's Big Island erupted following a significant increase in seismic activity in the area. The Puna power plant resumed operations in November 2020 and during 2021 operated at a level of 25 MW. We continue with drilling and workovers into 2022 to increase generation. In 2019, we reached an agreement with HELCO and signed a new PPA that is currently subject to PUC approval. The new PPA extends the current until 2052 and increases the current contract capacity by 8 MW to 46MW. In addition, the new PPA has a fixed price with no escalation, regardless of changes to fossil fuel pricing, which impacts the majority of our current pricing under the existing PPA. The existing PPA remains in effect with its current terms until the earlier of a) PPA's expiration date at the end of 2027 and b) the new PPA will be in effect.
 
(9) Dixie Valley geothermal and Beowawe power plants located in Nevada were acquired from Terra-Gen LLC in July 2021.
 
(10)85% of the Bouillante power plant is owned jointly by Ormat and CDC allocated 75% to Ormat and 25% to CDC.
 
(11) The Olkaria complex experienced lower performance of the wellfield in 2021 and currently is generating 123 MW. In addition, a task force was appointed by the President to review and analyze PPAs between various independent power producers and KPLC, including Ormat's long term PPA for the Olkaria complex. In September 2021 the task force recommended to the President that KPLC review its contracts and attempt renegotiation with Independent Power Producers to secure reductions in PPA tariffs within existing contractual arrangements. Ormat was approached by the task force following release of the report.
 
(12)We hold the Platanares assets, including the project’s wells, land, permits and a PPA, under a BOT structure for 15 years from the date the Platanares plant commenced commercial operation on September 26, 2017. A portion of the land on which the project is located is held by us through a lease from a local municipality. 
 
(13) The Sarulla complex is experiencing a reduction in generation primarily due to wellfield issues at one of its power plants, as well as equipment failures which resulted in a decrease in profitability. To address these issues, the project management developed a Long-Term Recovery Plan ("LTRP") that includes drilling of additional wells and various equipment modifications. The LTRP is expected to be implemented starting in 2022, pending approval by the lenders. Additional initiatives are also undergoing in an effort to strengthen the Sarulla project's financial position, including potential tariff changes. We are following the progress and results of the LTRP in Sarulla  as well as the accounting impact and its implication on our financial statements on our investment in Sarulla.
 
(14)  In May 2021, we successfully completed a 15MW enhancement to the MGH complex and its generating capacity increased to 160 MW.
 
(15) The Tungsten solar power plant generates energy that is used for the auxiliary power of the geothermal power plant.
 
Future Projects 
 
Projects Released for Construction 
 
We have several projects in various stages of construction, including 13 projects that we have fully released for construction with a total capacity of  150MW and one project with capacity of 10MW to 15MW that is in the early stage of construction. In 2021, due to COVID-19 and other factors, we saw continuous delays in getting all relevant permits as well as panels for the Solar PV project, and as a result we are seeing continuous delays in the expected COD.
 
    33 

  

These projects are expected to have a total geothermal generating capacity of between 108 MW and 113MW (representing our interest) and solar PV projects with a total AC capacity of 52 MW.

Projects under Various Stages of Development that were not Released for Construction 
 
We also have projects under various stages of development in the United States, Indonesia and Guadeloupe that we estimate will increase the generating capacity of our geothermal projects by approximately 47 MW to 58 MW (representing our interest) and Solar PV project with a total of 14 MW. We expect to continue to explore these and other opportunities for expansion so long as they continue to meet our business objectives and investment criteria. However, we prioritize our investments based on their readiness for continued construction and expected economics and therefore we are not planning to invest in all of such projects in 2022.

Operations of our Product Segment 
 
Power Units for Geothermal Power Plants
 
We design, manufacture, and sell power units for geothermal electricity generation, which we refer to as OECs. Our customers include contractors and geothermal plant owners and operators.
 
The power units are usually paid for in installments, in accordance with milestones set forth in the supply agreement. We also provide the purchaser with spare parts (either upon their request or our recommendation). We provide the purchaser with at least a 12-month warranty for such products. We provide the purchaser with performance guarantees (usually in the form of standby letters of credit), which partially terminates upon delivery of the equipment to the site and terminates in full at the end of the warranty period.
 
Power Units for Recovered Energy-Based Power Generation
 
We design, manufacture, and sell power units used to generate electricity from recovered energy or so-called “waste heat”. Our existing and target customers include interstate natural gas pipeline owners and operators, gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators, biomass facilities owners and operators and all other companies engaged in energy-intensive industrial processes such as glass, steel and other. We manufacture and sell the power units for recovered energy-based power generation to third parties for use in “inside-the-fence” installations or otherwise.
 
    35 

  

Remote Power Units and other Generators
 
We design, manufacture and sell fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with capacities ranging from 200 watts to 5,000 watts, which operate unattended in extreme hot or cold climate conditions. The remote power units supply energy to remote unmanned installations and along communications lines and provide cathodic protection along gas and oil pipelines. Our customers include contractors installing gas pipelines in remote areas. In addition, we manufacture and sell generators, including heavy duty direct current generators, for various other uses. The terms for sale of the turbo-generators are similar to those for the power units we produce for power plants.
 
EPC of Power Plants
 
We engineer, procure and construct, as an EPC contractor, geothermal and recovered energy power plants on a turnkey basis, using power units we design and manufacture. Our customers are geothermal power plant owners as well as our target customers for the sale of our recovered-energy based power units described above. Unlike many other companies that provide EPC services, we believe that our advantage is in using our own manufactured equipment and thus have better quality and control over the timing and delivery of equipment and related costs. The consideration for such services is usually paid in installments, in accordance with milestones set forth in the EPC contract and related documents. We provide performance guarantees securing our obligations under the contract.
 
In connection with the sale of our power units for geothermal power plants, power units for recovered energy-based power generation, remote power units and other generators, we enter into sales agreements, from time to time, with sales representatives for the marketing and sale of such products pursuant to which we are obligated to pay commissions to such representatives upon the sale of our products in the relevant territory covered by such agreements by such representatives or, in some cases, by other representatives in such territory.
 
Our manufacturing operations and products are certified ISO 9001, ISO 14001, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and TÜV, and we are an approved supplier to many electric utilities around the world.
 
Backlog 
 
We have a product backlog of approximately $53.5 million as of February 16, 2022, which includes revenues for the period between January 1, 2022 and February 16, 2022, compared to $33.4 million as of February 25, 2021, which included revenues for the period between January 1, 2021 and February 25, 2021. The increase in the 2022 backlog is mainly related to an initial recovery following COVID-19 related impacts. After a slowdown in raw materials and marine transportation costs, we expect the recovery to continue.
 
The following is a breakdown of the Product segment backlog amount (in $ millions) by countries as of February 16, 2022:

Energy Storage Pipeline
 
For an energy storage prospect to move into the EPC phase, it requires  site control, an executed interconnection agreement, permits from all authorities and a viable financial model. We have a substantial pipeline of approximately 2.3GW/5.7GWh of projects in different stages of development for future development in the United States that will support our target to reach an energy storage portfolio of between 313MW to 373MW by the end of 2023.
 
    37 

  

Competition 
 
Electricity Segment
 
In our Electricity segment, we face competition from geothermal power plant owners and developers as well as other renewable energy providers and developers.
 
Competition in the Electricity segment occurs in the very early stage of development and in advanced stages when obtaining a PPA. The early stage is primarily obtaining the rights to the resource for development of future projects or acquiring a site already in a more advanced stage of development. From time to time and in different jurisdictions competing geothermal developers become our customers in the Product segment.
 
Our main competitors in the geothermal sector in the United States are CalEnergy, Calpine Corporation, Enel Green Power S.p.A., Cyrq Energy Inc. and other smaller pure play developers. Outside the United States, in many cases our competitors are companies that are gaining experience developing geothermal projects in their own countries such as Mercury and Contact Energy in New Zealand, Energy Development Corporation from the Philippines, Storenergy and Meridian from France and Enel Green Power from Italy. Some Turkish developers are also focusing on the international market. Additionally, we face competition from country-specific companies and smaller pure play geothermal developers.
 
In obtaining new PPAs, we also face competition from companies engaged in the power generation business from other renewable energy sources, such as wind power, biomass, solar power and hydroelectric power. In the United States we primarily compete against solar power generation combined with energy storage. We also face competition from existing geothermal power plants as they are re-contracted.
 
As a geothermal company, we are focused on niche markets where our baseload and flexibility advantages can allow us to develop competitive projects.
 
Product Segment 
 
In our Product segment, we face competition from power plant equipment manufacturers and system integrators as well as engineering or project management companies.
 
Our competitors among power plant equipment suppliers are divided by technology, steam turbines and binary power plant manufacturers. Our main steam turbine competitors are industrial steam turbine manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation of Japan, GE/Nuovo Pignone and Ansaldo Energia of Italy.
 
Our binary technology competitors are manufacturers using the ORC technology such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries through Turboden, TICA, a Chinese air conditioning company that acquired Italian Exergy, Egesim, a Turkish electrical contractor who is collaborating with Atlas Copco mainly in the Turkish market and internationally, Kaishan, a compressor manufacturer from China who also develops its own projects and Fuji Electric Co., Ltd of Japan. While we believe that we have a distinct competitive advantage based on our accumulated experience and current worldwide share of installed binary geothermal generation capacity (which is approximately 78%), an increase in competition, which we are currently experiencing, has started to affect our ability to secure new purchase orders from potential customers. The increased competition in addition to increase in raw material costs led to a reduction in the operating margins, which in turn impacted our profitability.
 
In the REG business, our competitors are other ORC manufacturers, mainly Mitsubishi/Turboden and TICA/Exergy, which dominate binary waste heat recovery market installations. Other manufacturers are conventional steam turbines and small scale ORC suppliers.
 
In the case of proposed EPC projects we also compete with other service suppliers, such as project/engineering companies or EPC contractors.
 
Energy Storage Segment
 
In our Energy Storage segment, we face significant competition from companies that already have established businesses in those technologies and markets as well as companies seeking to acquire established businesses and other new market entrants.
 
    38 

  

The energy storage space is comprised of many companies divided into different verticals and sub verticals like independent power producers, project developers, system integrators, EPC contractors , component suppliers (e.g. batteries, inverters, control software, and balance of plant), scheduling coordinators, etc. The energy storage space is seeing tremendous interest that is manifested by the consolidation of small and medium players under big energy players. We continue to develop greenfield projects with great emphasis on the quality of the location and other characteristics that will make for highly profitable projects as well as target strategic acquisitions of development assets or platforms. Additionally, our analytical operational platform and growing experience in energy storage operation and integration with electricity markets, as well as our engineering and system integration capabilities, allow us to provide multiple value streams from a single storage installation. We have continued and plan to continue to grow our energy storage business in these markets.

Collective Bargaining Agreements & Employee Unions
 
As of December 31, 2021, the only employees that are represented by a labor union are the employees of our acquired Bouillante power plant located in Guadeloupe. The employees in Guadeloupe are represented by the Confédération Générale du Travail de Guadeloupe. We have never experienced any labor dispute, strike or work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are positive.
 
We have no collective bargaining agreements with respect to our Israeli employees. However, by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement between the Histadrut (the General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (which includes the Industrialists Association) may apply to some of our Israeli non-managerial, finance and administrative, and sales and marketing personnel. This collective bargaining agreement principally concerns cost of living pay increases, length of the workday, minimum wages and insurance for work-related accidents, annual and other vacation, sick pay, and determination of severance pay, pension contributions, and other conditions of employment. We currently provide such employees with benefits and working conditions, which are at least as favorable as the conditions specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 
Sustainability Strategy
 
We are committed to engaging with its stakeholders on, and strengthening our commitment to, sustainability issues, including environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. We endorse external initiatives and partner with national and international associations that we believe assist us in meeting our ESG commitments and values, in particular, relating to geothermal, energy and health and safety issues. We strive to provide recent, credible and comparable data to ESG agencies while engaging institutional investors and investor advocacy organizations around ESG issues.
 
As a renewable energy solution provider, we are motivated to identify our opportunities and risks with respect to climate change and take efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and improve our energy efficiency. In addition to meeting our regulatory requirements, we report our annual GHG emissions to global organizations, including CDP and the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection’s voluntary business reporting initiative.
 
As noted above, we report our progress on environmental goals and commitments annually in our Sustainability Reports, including, but not limited to, our climate change mitigation measures, biodiversity conservation, and water management efforts. A copy of our most recent Sustainability Report is accessible, free-of-charge, on our website at https://investor.ormat.com/sustainability-report. The information that we include in these sustainability reports is incorporated into this Annual Report.

Insurance 
 
We maintain physical damage and business interruption insurance, including the perils of flood, volcanic eruption, earthquake and windstorm, cyber coverage, general and excess liability, pollution legal liability, control of well, drilling rigs, construction risks, as well as customary worker’s compensation and automobile, marine transportation insurance and such other commercially available insurance as is generally carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in the same general areas as us. Such insurance covering our properties extends to Ormat and/or our owned, controlled, direct or indirect affiliated or associated companies, subsidiary companies or corporations in amounts generally based upon the estimated replacement value and maximum foreseeable loss of our facilities (provided that certain perils including earthquake, volcanic eruption and flood coverage are subject to sublimit and/or annual aggregate limits depending on the type and location of the facility) and business interruption insurance coverage in an amount that also varies from location to location.
 
We purchase certain insurance policies to cover our book equity investment to specified political risks involved in operating in developing countries. We hold a global political risk insurance program covering the significant political risks at certain of our locations. This program is issued by the global insurers in the private sector. Such insurance policies generally cover, subject to the limitations and restrictions contained therein, losses derived from a specified governmental act, such as expropriation, political violence, and the inability to convert local currency into hard currency and, in certain cases, the breach of agreements with governmental entities, in approximately 90% of our book net equity investment.
 
Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in the United States
 
The following is a summary overview of the electric utility industry and applicable federal and state regulations and should not be considered a full statement of the law or all issues pertaining thereto.
 
PURPA
 
PURPA and FERC's regulations thereunder exempt owners of small power production Qualifying Facilities that use geothermal resources as their primary source and other Qualifying Facilities that are 30 MW or under in size from regulation under the PUHCA 2005, from many provisions of the FPA and from state laws relating to the financial, organization and rate regulation of electric utilities.
 
PURPA provides the owners of power plants certain benefits described below if a power plant is a “Qualifying Facility.” A small power production facility is a Qualifying Facility if: (i) the facility does not exceed 80 MW; (ii) the primary energy source of the facility is biomass, waste, geothermal, or renewable resources, or any combination thereof, and at least 75% of the total energy input of the facility is from these sources, and fossil fuel input is limited to specified uses; and (iii) the facility, if larger than one megawatt, has filed with FERC a notice of self-certification of qualifying status, or has been certified as a Qualifying Facility by FERC. The 80 MW size limitation, however, does not apply to a facility if (i) it produces electric energy solely by the use, as a primary energy input, of solar, wind, waste or geothermal resources; and (ii) an application for certification or a notice of self-certification of qualifying status of the facility was submitted to not later than December 31, 1994, and construction of the facility commenced not later than December 31, 1999.
 
With respect to the FPA, FERC's regulations under PURPA do not exempt from the rate provisions of the FPA sales of energy or capacity from Qualifying Facilities larger than 20 MW in size that are made (a) pursuant to a contract executed after March 17, 2006 or (b) not pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA. The practical effect of these regulations is to require owners of Qualifying Facilities that are larger than 20 MW in size to obtain market-based rate authority from FERC if they seek to sell energy or capacity other than pursuant to a contract executed on or before March 17, 2006 or pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA. A sale to a public utility under PURPA at state approved avoided cost rates is generally exempt from FERC rate regulation.
 
In addition, provided that the purchasing electric utility has not been relieved from its mandatory purchase obligation, PURPA and FERC’s regulations under PURPA obligate electric utilities to purchase energy and capacity from Qualifying Facilities at either the electric utility’s avoided cost or a negotiated rate. FERC's regulations under PURPA allow FERC, upon request of a utility, to terminate a utility’s obligation to purchase energy from Qualifying Facilities upon a finding that Qualifying Facilities have nondiscriminatory access to: (i) independently administered, auction-based day ahead, and real time markets for electric energy and wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity and electric energy; (ii) transmission and interconnection services provided by a FERC-approved regional transmission entity and administered under an open-access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers, and competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term, and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the Qualifying Facility is interconnected; or (iii) wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are at a minimum of comparable competitive quality as markets described in (i) and (ii) above. FERC regulations protect a Qualifying Facility’s rights under any contract or obligation involving purchases or sales that are entered into before FERC has determined that the contracting utility is entitled to relief from the mandatory purchase obligation. FERC has granted the request of California investor-owned utilities for a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation for Qualifying Facilities larger than 20 MW in size. In addition, FERC recently amended its PURPA regulations to reduce the rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities in organized markets have nondiscriminatory access to markets from 20 MW to 5 MW. Therefore, the California investor-owned utilities may have a basis to further reduce their mandatory purchase obligation.
 
    42 

  

We expect that our power plants in the U.S will continue to meet all of the criteria required for Qualifying Facility status under PURPA. However, since the Heber power plants have PPAs with Southern California Edison that require Qualifying Facility status to be maintained, maintaining Qualifying Facility status remains a key obligation. If any of the Heber power plants loses its Qualifying Facility status our operations could be adversely affected. Loss of Qualifying Facility status would eliminate the Heber power plants’ exemption from the FPA and thus, among other things, the rates charged by the Heber power plants in the PPAs with Southern California Edison and SCPPA would become subject to FERC regulation. Further, it is possible that the utilities that purchase power from the power plants could successfully obtain a waiver of the mandatory-purchase obligation in their service territories. If a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation is obtained, or if FERC reduces the 5 MW threshold or eliminates the mandatory purchase obligation, the power plants’ existing PPAs will not be affected, but the utilities will not be obligated under PURPA to renew or extend these PPAs or execute new PPAs upon the existing PPAs’ expiration.
 
PUHCA 
 
Under PUHCA 2005, the books and records of a utility holding company, its affiliates, associate companies, and subsidiaries are subject to FERC and state commission review with respect to transactions that are subject to the jurisdiction of either FERC or the state commission or costs incurred by a jurisdictional utility in the same holding company system. However, if a company is a utility holding company solely with respect to Qualifying Facilities, exempt wholesale generators, or foreign utility companies, it will not be subject to review of books and records by FERC under PUHCA 2005. Qualifying Facilities or exempt wholesale generators that make only wholesale sales of electricity are not subject to state commissions’ rate regulations and, therefore, in all likelihood would not be subject to any review of their books and records by state commissions pursuant to PUHCA 2005 as long as the Qualifying Facility is not part of a holding company system that includes a utility subject to regulation in that state. Additionally, most of our storage projects have exempt wholesale generator status, exempting them from PUHCA requirements as well.
FPA
 
Pursuant to the FPA, FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates for most wholesale sales of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. These rates may be based on a cost of service approach or may be determined on a market basis through competitive bidding or negotiation. FERC can accept, reject or suspend rates. The rates can be suspended for up to five months, at which point the rates become effective subject to refund. FERC can order refunds for rates that are found to be “unjust and unreasonable” or “unduly discriminatory or preferential.”
 
Moreover, the loss of the Qualifying Facility status of any of our power plants might also permit the off-taker, pursuant to the terms of its PPA, to cease taking and paying for electricity from the relevant power plant and to seek refunds for past amounts paid and/or a reduction in future payments.
 
Additionally, FERC possesses civil penalty authority, up to approximately $1.3 million per violation of the FPA per day. FERC can also require the disgorgement of unjust profits earned in connection with such violations of the FPA and revoke the right of the power plants to make sales at market-based rates.
 
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FPA was supplemented to empower FERC to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric system. Such authority required that FERC assume both oversight and enforcement roles. Pursuant to its new directive, FERC certified the North American Electric Reliability Corporation as the nation’s Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop and enforce mandatory reliability standards to address medium and long-term reliability concerns. Today, enforcement of the mandatory reliability standards, including the protection of critical energy infrastructure, is a substantial function of the ERO and of FERC, which may impose penalties of up to approximately $1.3 million a day for violating mandatory reliability standards. We examine our projects’ compliance with NERC standards on an ongoing basis and begin work on the process of NERC registration as new projects approach the threshold at which NERC standards become applicable.
 
    43 

  

Thus, if any of the power plants were to lose Qualifying Facility status, the application of the FPA and other applicable state regulations to such power plants could require compliance with an increasingly complex regulatory regime that may be costly and greatly reduce our operational flexibility. Even if a power plant does not lose Qualifying Facility status, the owner of a Qualifying Facility/power plant in excess of 20 MW will become subject to rate regulation under the FPA for sales of energy or capacity pursuant to a contract executed after March 17, 2006 or not pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA. A decrease in existing rates or being ordered by FERC to pay refunds for rates found to be “unjust and unreasonable” or “unduly discriminatory or preferential” would likely result in a decrease in our future revenues.
 
State Regulation 
 
Our power plants in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Idaho, by virtue of being Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of electricity, are not subject to rate, financial and organizational regulations applicable to electric utilities in those states. The power plants each sell or will sell their electrical output under PPAs to electric utilities (Sierra Pacific Power Company, Nevada Power Company, Southern California Edison, SCPPA and Idaho Power Company). All of the utilities except SCPPA are regulated by their respective state public utilities commissions. Sierra Pacific Power Company and Nevada Power Company, which merged and are doing business as NV Energy, are regulated by the PUCN. Southern California Edison is regulated by the CPUC.
 
Under Hawaiian law, non-fossil generators are not subject to regulation as public utilities. Hawaiian law provides that a geothermal power producer is to negotiate the rate for its output with the public utility purchaser. If such rate cannot be determined by mutual accord, the PUCH will set a just and reasonable rate. If a non-fossil generator in Hawaii is a Qualifying Facility, federal law applies to such Qualifying Facility and the utility is required to purchase the energy and capacity at its avoided cost. The rates for our power plant in Hawaii are established under a long-term PPA with HELCO.
 
Environmental Permits 
 
U.S. environmental permitting regimes with respect to geothermal projects center upon several general areas of focus. The first involves land use approvals. These may take the form of Special Use Permits or Conditional Use Permits from local planning authorities or a series of development and utilization plan approvals and right of way approvals where the geothermal facility is entirely or partly on BLM or United States Forest Service lands. Certain federal approvals require a review of environmental impacts in conformance with the federal National Environmental Policy Act. In California, some local permit approvals require a similar review of environmental impacts under a state statute known as the California Environmental Quality Act. These federal and local land use approvals typically impose conditions and restrictions on the construction, scope and operation of geothermal projects.
 
The second category of permitting focuses on the installation and use of the geothermal wells themselves. Geothermal projects typically have three types of wells: (i) exploration wells designed to define and verify the geothermal resource, (ii) production wells to extract the hot geothermal liquids (also known as brine) for the power plant, and (iii) injection wells to inject the brine back into the subsurface resource. For example, on BLM lands in Nevada, California, Oregon, and Idaho, the well permits take the form of geothermal drilling permits for well installation. Approvals are also required to modify wells, including for use as production or injection wells. For all wells drilled in Nevada, a geothermal drilling permit must be obtained from the Nevada Division of Minerals. Those wells in Nevada to be used for injection will also require UIC permits from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection and Bureau of Water Pollution Control. All geothermal wells drilled in Oregon (except on tribal lands) require a geothermal well drilling permit from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. All geothermal wells drilled in Idaho require a well construction permit from the IDWR and injection wells also require UIC permitting through IDWR. Geothermal wells on private lands in California require drilling permits from the California Department of Conservation’s DOGGR. The eventual designation of these installed wells as individual production or injection wells and the ultimate closure of any wells is also reviewed and approved by DOGGR pursuant to a DOGGR-approved Geothermal Injection Program.
 
A third category of permits involves the regulation of potential air emissions associated with the construction and operation of wells and power plants and surface water discharges associated with construction and operations activities. Generally, each well and plant requires a preconstruction air permit and storm water discharge permit before earthwork can commence. In addition, in some jurisdictions the wells that are to be used for production require, and those used for injection may require air emissions permits to operate. Internal combustion engines and other air pollutant emissions sources at the projects may also require air emissions permits. For our projects, these permits are typically issued at the state or county level. Permits are also required to manage storm water during project construction and to manage drilling mud from well construction, as well as to manage certain discharges to surface impoundment, if any.
 
    44 

  

A fourth category of permits, required in Nevada, California, Oregon, and Idaho, includes ministerial permits such as building permits, hazardous materials storage and management permits, and pressure vessel operating permits. We are also required to obtain water rights permits in Nevada if water cooling is being used at the power plant. In addition to permits, there are various regulatory plans and programs that are required, including risk management plans (federal and state programs) and hazardous materials management plans (in California).
 
In some cases, our projects may also require permits, issued by the applicable federal agencies or authorized state agencies, regarding threatened or endangered species, permits to impact wetlands or other waters and notices of construction of structures which may have an impact on airspace. Environmental laws and regulations may change in the future that may modify the time to receive such permits and associated costs of compliance.
 
Our BESS projects are subject to similar permitting and regulatory compliance requirements. All of our current BESS projects are located on privately owned land and may require ministerial permits from local agencies as described above or undergo a state environmental permitting process (e.g., under the California Environmental Quality Act) with the city or county as the lead permitting agency. Storage projects are also required to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and similar to geothermal projects, storage projects may require various regulatory plans and programs including emergency action plans and fire response plans.
 
As of the date of this report, all of the material environmental permits and approvals currently required for our operating power plants and BESS projects have been obtained. We sometimes experience regulatory delays in obtaining various environmental permits and approvals required for projects in development and construction. These delays may lead to increases in the time and cost to complete these projects. Our operations are designed and conducted to comply with applicable environmental permit and approval requirements. Non-compliance with any such requirements could result in fines and penalties and could also affect our ability to operate the affected project.
 
Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
Our facilities and operations are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to development, construction and operation. In the U.S, these may include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws and regulations.
 
Our geothermal operations involve significant quantities of brine (substantially, all of which we reinject into the subsurface) and scale, both of which can contain materials (such as arsenic, antimony, lead, and naturally occurring radioactive materials) in concentrations that exceed regulatory limits used to define hazardous waste. We also use various substances, including isopentane and industrial lubricants that could become potential contaminants and are generally flammable. As a result, our projects are subject to domestic and foreign federal, state and local statutory and regulatory requirements regarding the generation, handling, transportation, use, storage, treatment, fugitive emissions, and disposal of hazardous substances. The cost of investigation and removal or remediation activities associated with a spill or release of such materials could be significant. Hazardous materials are also used in our equipment manufacturing operations in Israel.
 
Although we are not aware of any mismanagement of these materials, including any mismanagement prior to the acquisition of some of our power plants that has materially impaired any of the power plant sites, any disposal or release of these materials onto the power plant sites, other than by means of permitted injection wells, could lead to contamination of the environment and result in material cleanup requirements or other responsive obligations under applicable environmental laws.
 
    45 

  

Regulation Related to the Energy Storage Segment
 
Our participation in energy storage space and in energy management and demand response require us to obtain and maintain certain additional authorizations and approvals.  These include (1) authorization from FERC to make wholesale sales of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates, and (2) membership status with eligibility to serve designated contractual functions in the ISO/RTOs of PJM, NYISO, CAISO, ISO-NE, and ERCOT. Among other requirements, our market-based rate sellers are subject to certain market behavior and anti-market manipulation rules and, if any of our subsidiaries were deemed to have violated any one of those rules, such subsidiary could be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of market-based rate authority, as well as criminal and civil penalties. If the market-based rate authority for one (or more) of our subsidiaries was revoked or it was not able to obtain market-based rate authority when necessary, and it was required to sell energy on a cost-of-service basis, it could become subject to the full accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements of FERC. In the future, we may need to obtain and maintain similar membership and eligibility status with other ISO/RTOs in order to offer such services in their respective areas.
 
Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in our Foreign Countries of Operation 
 
The following is a summary overview of certain aspects of the electric industry in the foreign countries in which we have an operating geothermal power plant. As such, it should not be considered a full statement of the laws in such countries or all of the issues pertaining thereto.
 
Guatemala
 
The General Electricity Law of 1996, Decree 93-96, created a wholesale electricity market in Guatemala and established a new regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The law created a new regulatory commission, the CNEE, and a new wholesale power market administrator, the AMM, for the operation and administration of the sector. The AMM is a private not-for-profit entity. The CNEE functions as an independent agency under the Ministry of Energy and Mines and is in charge of regulating, supervising, and controlling compliance with the electricity law, overseeing the market and setting rates for transmission services, and distribution to medium and small customers. All distribution companies must supply electricity to such customers pursuant to long-term contracts with electricity generators. Large customers can contract directly with the distribution companies, electricity generators or power marketers, or buy energy in the spot market. Guatemala has approved a Law of Incentives for the Development of Renewable Energy Power plants, Decree 52-2003, in order to promote the development of renewable energy power plants in Guatemala. This law provides certain benefits to companies utilizing renewable energy, including a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax and VAT on imports and customs duties. On September 16, 2008, CNEE issued a resolution that approved the Technical Norms for the Connection, Operation, Control and Commercialization of the Renewable Distributed Generation and Self-producers Users with Exceeding Amounts of Energy. This Technical Norm was created to regulate all aspects of generation, connection, operation, control and commercialization of electric energy produced with renewable sources to promote and facilitate the installation of new generation plants, and to promote the connection of existing generation plants which have excess amounts of electric energy for commercialization. It is applicable to projects with a capacity of up to 5 MW. At present, the General Electricity Law and the Law of Incentives for the Development or Renewable Energy Power Plants are still in force.
Kenya

The electric power sector in Kenya is regulated by the Kenyan Energy Act.  Among other things, the Kenyan Energy Act provides for the licensing of electricity power producers and public electricity suppliers or distributors. KPLC is the major licensed public electricity supplier and has a virtual monopoly in the distribution of electricity in the country with the exception of a few off-grid, which have recently been licensed by the EPRA. The Kenyan Energy Act permits IPPs to install power generators and sell electricity to KPLC, which is owned by various private and government entities, and which currently purchases energy and capacity from other IPPs in addition to our Olkaria III complex. The electricity sector is regulated by the EPRA under the Kenyan Energy Act. KPLC’s retail electricity rates are subject to approval by the EPRA. The EPRA has an expanded mandate to regulate not just the electric power sector but the entire energy sector in Kenya. Transmission of electricity is now undertaken by KETRACO while another company, GDC, is responsible for geothermal assessment, drilling of wells and sale of steam for electricity operations to IPPs and KenGen.  Both KETRACO and GDC are wholly owned by the government of Kenya. Renewable energy dominated by geothermal, wind and, presently at a lower level, solar is one of the key energy sub-sectors in Kenya contributing significantly to the overall energy mix as a result of the implementation of the feed-in- tariff policy by the Ministry of Energy. Under the national constitution enacted in August 2010, formulation of energy policy (including electricity) and energy regulation are functions of the national government. However, the constitution lists the planning and development of electricity and energy regulation as a function of the county governments (i.e. the regional or local level where an individual power plant is or is intended to be located).

Indonesia
 
The 2009 Electricity Law (as amended by the Indonesian Omnibus Law in 2020) divides the power business into two broad categories: (i) activities that supply electrical power, both public supply and captive supply (own use), such as electrical power generation, electrical power transmission, electrical power distribution and the sale of electrical power and (ii) the activities involved in electrical power support such as services businesses (consulting, construction, installation, operation & maintenance, certification & training, testing etc.) and industry businesses (power tools & power equipment supply electricity power supporting businesses). Currently, power generation is dominated by PLN (state owned company), which controls around 70% of generating assets in Indonesia. Private sector participation is allowed through an IPP scheme. IPP appointment mostly is done through tenders although IPPs can also be directly appointed or selected. The 2009 Electricity Law, as amended, provides PLN priority rights to conduct the electricity power business nationwide. As the sole owner of transmission and distribution assets, PLN remains the only business entity involved in transmitting and distributing, although the 2009 Electricity Law, as amended, allows private participation. The Geothermal Law issued in 2014 (as also amended by the Indonesian Omnibus Law in 2020), endorses private participation as geothermal IPP. The geothermal IPP appointment is done through tender held by the Central Government. The central government will also award the tender winner a Geothermal License (IPB). Accordingly, the Geothermal License holder can conduct exploration and feasibility studies within five years and subject to two one-year extensions, conduct well development and power plant construction and sell the electricity generated to PLN for a maximum of 30 years. Prior to the expiration of the Geothermal License, the IPP can propose to extend the license for an additional 20 years. Starting in 2017, the regulatory framework with respect to tariffs is based on PLN's existing average cost of generation (known by its Indonesian acronym, BPP) with respect to the relevant local grid cost of generation, excluding transmission and distribution costs. The Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources ("MEMR") releases each year a list of local BPPs for each region and a national BPP (which is an average of the local BPPs). The BPPs for a particular year are based on PLN's previous year audited generation costs. In 2019, the MEMR published BPP figures of year 2018. The national BPP was set at Rp 983/kWh (equivalent to US$ cent 7.39/kWh at Rp 13,307/US$).
 
For 2020, the regulation was not clear and has been revoked, but the general interpretation is that for geothermal projects in Sumatera, Java and Bali islands, the tariff will be determined based on mutual agreement between PLN and the IPP, regardless of the BPP figures in those regions.
 
Draft presidential regulation on new tariffs, which replaces the BPP tariff as a basis with attractive tariffs based on power plant size and region, has been publicly published, but not yet signed into law.
 
Guadeloupe 
 
EDF is the transmission and distribution utility in Guadeloupe and also operates a significant portion of Guadeloupe’s fossil fuel energy generation. There are also a number of IPPs in Guadeloupe, primarily producing renewable electricity. The electricity sector in Guadeloupe is regulated by the Commission Regulation of Energy (CRE), which also regulates EDF’s operations in mainland France and its other overseas territories. The electricity sector in Guadeloupe is characterized by both enabling features and obstacles with respect to renewable energy. One of the most influential enabling features is a French law requiring the utility to purchase power from any interconnected renewable generator. The major obstacle preventing further uptake of renewable electricity generation is the cap on variable generation at 30% of instantaneous system load. According to the multi-annual energy program (PPE) for Guadeloupe, the island aims to reach total energy independence by 2030. The program outlines the development schedule with an emphasis on solar, wind and geothermal growth for the years 2023-2026. The PPE also predict a geothermal installed capacity of 78MW by 2028.

Honduras
 
In 2014, Honduras approved its new Law of Electrical Industry (Decree 404-2013, and its Regulation, published in the Official Newspaper on November 18, 2015; and by Executive Accord 07-2015), which provides the legal framework for the electricity sector and replaces the previous Electricity Subsector Framework Law (Decree 158 of 1994, regulated by Accord 934 of 1997).   The Law establishes technology-specific auctions for renewable energy. It creates the Regulatory Commission of Electric Power (CREE) as the entity in charge of supervising the bidding processes and the awarding of PPAs. The CREE is also responsible for granting study permits for the construction of generation projects that use renewable natural resources. Permits will have a maximum duration of two years, and will be revoked if no studies have been initiated within a period of six months and the reports required by the CREE have not been submitted. The new Law also establishes that all new capacity must be contracted through auctions and that the government can set a minimum quota for renewables in each auction. With respect to metering, after previous regulation applied legal incentives to renewable energy metering, the new law mandates utilities to buy excess power and credit it towards monthly bills and to install bi-directional meters. 
 
Among others, the objectives of the law are to adapt the electricity sector’s legislation to the Framework Treaty for the Central American Electricity Market, which Honduras is a party to, and update the operating rules in the country’s electricity industry by incorporating structures and modern practices to increase the sector’s efficiency and competency in the production and marketing of electricity services.
 
With the passage of this new law, Honduras is moving into a new and open market. Under this legislation, all aspects of the market have been opened to private parties. This legislation is still being implemented within the market.
 
Honduras has also approved a Law of Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects, Decree 70-2007, further amended by Decree 138-2013, with additional incentives to solar PV projects, etc.  The purpose, as in other countries of the region, is to promote the development of renewable energy power plants. Laws provide certain benefits to companies that generate power through renewable sources, including a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax and VAT on imports and customs duties, a fast track process for certain permits and a Sovereign Guaranty by the Central Government for the payments of the off-taker, the Public Utility Company, ENEE.  At present, the Law of the Electrical Industry and the Laws of Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects are still in force.
