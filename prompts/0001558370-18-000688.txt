     Item 1.Business
     Our Company
     We were incorporated in Maryland on June 28, 2004. We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As of December 31, 2017, we had interests in 27 hotels (the “27 hotels”), including the Marriott Philadelphia and the Marriott Quincy which we classified as held for sale and subsequently sold in January 2018, leaving 25 hotels currently held for investment (the “25 hotels”). The 25 hotels are comprised of 12,450 rooms, located in 11 states and in Washington, DC.
     Our primary business is to acquire, own, asset manage and renovate primarily hotels that we consider to be long-term relevant real estate in the United States. As part of our ongoing portfolio management strategy, we may also sell hotel properties from time to time. All but two (the Boston Park Plaza and the Oceans Edge Hotel & Marina) of our 25 hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands such as Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt, which are among the most respected and widely recognized brands in the lodging industry. We believe the largest and most stable segment of travelers prefer the consistent service and quality associated with nationally recognized brands and well-known independent hotels. Our portfolio primarily consists of urban and resort upper upscale hotels in the United States. Of the 25 hotels, we include 22 as upper upscale, two as upscale and one as luxury as defined by STR, Inc., an independent provider of lodging industry statistical data. STR, Inc. classifies hotel chains into the following segments: luxury; upper upscale; upscale; upper midscale; midscale; economy; and independent.
     Our hotels are operated by third-party managers pursuant to long-term management agreements with our TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, our third-party managers included: subsidiaries of Marriott International, Inc. or Marriott Hotel Services, Inc. (collectively “Marriott”), managers of nine of the Company’s 25 hotels; Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“IHR”), manager of four of the Company’s 25 hotels; Highgate Hotels L.P. and an affiliate (“Highgate”), manager of three of the Company’s 25 hotels; Crestline Hotels & Resorts (“Crestline”), Hilton Worldwide (“Hilton”) and Hyatt Corporation (“Hyatt”), each a manager of two of the Company’s 25 hotels; and Davidson Hotels & Resorts (“Davidson”), HEI Hotels & Resorts (“HEI”) and Singh Hospitality, LLC (“Singh”), each a manager of one of the Company’s 25 hotels.

 Competitive Strengths
     We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners of lodging properties:

· | High Quality Portfolio.
--+------------------------

      Focus on Owning Long-Term Relevant Real Estate. We believe that we will create lasting stockholder value through the active ownership of long-term relevant real estate. Long-term relevant real estate consists of hotels that we believe possess unique attributes that are difficult to replicate, and most of all, whose locations are relevant today and will remain relevant for generations to come. We believe that owning long-term relevant real estate reduces the risk of waning demand that often happens to undercapitalized and pedestrian hotels.
     Presence in Key Markets. A cornerstone of long-term relevant real estate is location. We believe that our hotels are located in many desirable long-term relevant markets with major and diverse demand generators and significant barriers to entry for new supply. In 2017, approximately 96% of the revenues generated by the 25 hotels were earned by hotels located in key gateway markets and unique resort locations such as Boston, New York, Washington, DC/Baltimore, Chicago, Orlando, Key West, New Orleans, San Francisco, Los Angeles/Orange County, San Diego and Maui. Over time, we expect the revenues of hotels located in key gateway markets and unique resort locations to generate superior long-term growth rates as compared to the average for U.S. hotels, as a result of stronger and more diverse economic drivers.
     Nationally Recognized Brands and Well Known Independents. All but two of our 25 hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands, including Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt. We believe that affiliations with strong brands improve the appeal of our hotels to a broad set of travelers and help to drive business to our hotels. Our two unbranded hotels are located in top urban and resort markets that have enabled them to build awareness with both group and transient customers.
     Recently Renovated Hotels. From January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017, we invested $652.2 million in capital renovations throughout the 25 hotels. We believe that these capital renovations have improved the competitiveness of our hotels and have helped to position our portfolio for future growth.
    
· | Significant Cash Position. As of December 31, 2017, we had total cash of $559.3 million, including $71.3 million of restricted cash. Adjusting for the significant cash transactions that occurred in January 2018, including the $133.9 million payment of our common and preferred dividends and the approximately $139.0 million received from the sales of the Marriott Philadelphia and the Marriott Quincy, our total pro forma cash including restricted cash as of December 31, 2017 would be $564.4 million. By minimizing our need to access external capital by maintaining higher than typical cash balances, our financial security and flexibility are meaningfully enhanced because we are able to fund our business needs, debt maturities, capital investment and acquisitions with cash on hand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexible Capital Structure. We believe our capital structure provides us with appropriate financial flexibility to execute our strategy. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average term to maturity of our debt was approximately five years, and 77.8% of our debt was fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%, including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements. Including our variable-rate debt obligation based on the variable rate at December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on our debt was 4.1%. Our mortgage debt is in the form of single asset non-recourse loans rather than in cross-collateralized multi-property pools. In addition to our mortgage debt, as of December 31, 2017, we had two unsecured corporate-level term loans, and two series of senior unsecured corporate-level notes. We currently believe our unsecured debt structure is appropriate for the operating characteristics of our business as it provides flexibility for various portfolio management initiatives, including asset sales, capital investment and management changes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Low Leverage. Over the past six years, we have been committed to thoughtfully and methodically reducing our leverage while maintaining a focus on creating and protecting stockholder value. We believe that our low leverage capital structure not only minimizes the risk of potential value destructive consequences in periods of
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

economic recession, but also provides the company with significant optionality to create stockholder value through all phases of the operating cycle.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Access to Low Cost Capital. As a publicly traded REIT, over the long-term, we may benefit from greater access to a variety of forms of capital as compared to non-public investment vehicles. In addition, over the long-term, we may benefit from a lower cost of capital as compared to non-public investment vehicles as a result of our investment liquidity, balance sheet optionality, professional management and portfolio diversification.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seasoned Management Team. Each of our core disciplines, including asset management, acquisitions, finance and legal, are overseen by industry leaders with demonstrated track records.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Asset Management. Our asset management team is responsible for maximizing the long-term value of our real estate investments by achieving above average revenue and profit performance through proactive oversight of hotel operations. Our asset management team leads property-level innovation, benchmarks best practices and aggressively oversees hotel management teams and property plans. We work with our operators to develop hotel-level “business plans,” which include positioning and capital renovation plans. We believe that a proactive asset management program can help grow the revenues of our hotel portfolio and maximize operational efficiency by leveraging best practices and innovations across our various hotels, and by initiating well-timed and focused capital improvements aimed at improving the appeal of our hotels.
     Acquisitions. Our acquisitions team is responsible for enhancing our portfolio quality and scale by executing well-timed acquisitions and dispositions that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on our investment dollars. We believe that our significant acquisition and disposition experience will allow us to continue to execute our strategy to redeploy capital from slower growth assets to long-term relevant real estate with higher long-term growth rates. Our primary focus is on acquiring long-term relevant real estate. We intend to select the branding and operators for our hotels that we believe will lead to the highest returns. We will also focus on capital recycling, and may selectively sell hotels that no longer fit our target profile, will not offer long-term returns in excess of our cost of capital, will achieve a sale price in excess of our internal valuation, or that have high risk relative to their anticipated returns.
     Finance. We have a highly experienced finance team focused on minimizing our cost of capital and maximizing our financial flexibility by proactively managing our capital structure and opportunistically sourcing appropriate capital for growth, while maintaining a best in class disclosure and investor relations program. Accordingly, our financial objectives include the maintenance of appropriate levels of liquidity throughout the cycle. During 2017, we reduced our total mortgage debt by $9.9 million through principal payments, and by an additional $176.0 million through repayment of one mortgage. We also refinanced an existing $219.6 million mortgage bearing interest at a variable  rate of one-month LIBOR plus 225 basis points maturing in August 2019 with a new interest only $220.0 million loan bearing interest at a variable rate of one-month LIBOR plus 105 basis points maturing in December 2020. The new loan contains three one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
     Legal. Our legal team is responsible for overseeing and supporting all company-wide legal matters, including all legal matters related to corporate (including corporate oversight and governance), investment, asset management, design and construction, finance initiatives and litigation. We believe active and direct oversight of legal matters allows the company the flexibility to pursue opportunities while minimizing legal exposure, protecting corporate assets, and ultimately maximizing stockholder returns.
     Business Strategy
     Our mission is to create meaningful value for our stockholders by producing superior long-term returns through the ownership of long-term relevant real estate in the lodging sector. Our values include transparency, trust, ethical conduct, honest communication and discipline. As demand for lodging generally fluctuates with the overall economy, we seek to own hotels that will maintain a high appeal with travelers over long periods of time and will generate economic earnings

materially in excess of recurring capital requirements. Our strategy is to maximize stockholder value through focused asset management and disciplined capital recycling, which is likely to include selective acquisitions and dispositions, while maintaining balance sheet flexibility and strength. Our goal is to maintain low leverage and high financial flexibility to position the company to create value throughout all phases of the operating and financial cycles.
     Competition
     The hotel industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests in each of their markets. Competitive advantage is based on a number of factors, including location, physical attributes, service levels and reputation. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands in the luxury, upper upscale and upscale segments. Increased competition could harm our occupancy or revenues or may lead our operators to unnecessarily increase service or amenity levels, which may reduce the profitability of our hotels.
     We believe that competition for the acquisition of hotels is fragmented. We face competition from institutional pension funds, private equity investors, high net worth individuals, other REITs and numerous local, regional, national and international owners in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During times when we seek to acquire hotels, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers.
     Management Agreements
     All of our 25 hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management agreements with our TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries. The following is a general description of our third-party management agreements as of December 31, 2017.
     Marriott. Our management agreements with Marriott require us to pay Marriott a base management fee equal to 3.0% of total revenue. Inclusive of renewal options and absent prior termination by either party, these management agreements expire between 2031 and 2078. Additionally, five of the aforementioned management agreements require payment of an incentive fee of 20.0% of the excess of gross operating profit over a certain threshold; one management agreement requires payment of an incentive fee of 20% of the excess of gross operating profit over a certain threshold, however the total base and incentive fees were capped at 4.25% of gross revenue for 2013, 4.5% of gross revenue for 2014, 4.75% of gross revenue for 2015, 5.0% of gross revenue for the first seven months of 2016, and are capped at 5.25% of gross revenue for the remaining term of the agreement; one management agreement requires payment of an incentive fee of 35.0% of the excess of gross operating profit over a certain threshold; one management agreement requires payment of a tiered incentive fee ranging from 15.0% to 20.0% of the excess of gross operating profit over certain thresholds; and one management agreement requires payment of an incentive fee of 10.0% of adjusted gross operating profit, capped at 3.0% of gross revenue. The management agreements with Marriott may be terminated earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including the failure of Marriott to satisfy certain performance standards, a condemnation of, a casualty to, or force majeure event involving a hotel, the withdrawal or revocation of any license or permit required in connection with the operation of a hotel and upon a default by Marriott or us that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods. In certain instances, Marriott has rights of first refusal to either purchase or lease hotels, or to terminate the applicable management agreement in the event we sell the respective hotel.
     IHR. Our management agreements with IHR require us to pay a management fee of 2.0% of gross revenue; plus an incentive fee of 10.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold. The incentive fee, however, may not exceed 1.5% of the total revenue for all the hotels managed by IHR for any fiscal year. The IHR management agreements expire in 2024 and provide us the right to renew each management agreement for up to two additional terms of five years each, absent a prior termination by either party.
     Highgate. Our Boston Park Plaza, Hilton Times Square and Renaissance Westchester hotels are operated under management agreements with Highgate. The management agreement at the Boston Park Plaza required us to pay Highgate a base management fee of 2.5% of gross revenue until July 1, 2014. From July 2, 2014 to July 1, 2015, the base management fee increased to 2.75% of gross revenue, and thereafter the base management fee is 3.0% of gross revenue. In

addition, the management agreement at the Boston Park Plaza requires us to pay an incentive fee of 15.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold. The agreement expires in 2023, absent a prior termination by either party.
     The management agreements at the Hilton Times Square and the Renaissance Westchester require us to pay Highgate a base management fee of 3.0% of gross revenue. In addition, the management agreement at the Hilton Times Square requires us to pay an incentive fee of 50.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold, limited to 1.25% of total revenue. The management agreement at the Hilton Times Square expires in 2021 and provides Highgate with the right to renew for two additional terms of five years upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds, absent a prior termination by either party. The management agreement at the Renaissance Westchester expires in 2022, absent early termination by either party, and does not require payment of an incentive fee.
     Crestline. Our Embassy Suites Chicago and Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile hotels are operated under management agreements with Crestline. The management agreement at the Embassy Suites Chicago expires in 2019 (absent early termination by either party), and provides no renewal options. The agreement required us to pay Crestline a base management fee of 1.5% of gross revenue through May 31, 2016, increasing to 2.0% of gross revenue thereafter.
     The management agreement at the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile expires in 2022 (absent early termination by either party), and provides us with the right to renew for up to two additional terms of five years each. The agreement requires us to pay 2.0% of gross revenue as a base management fee, and requires us to pay an incentive fee of 10.0% of the excess of operating profit over a certain threshold.
     Hilton. Our Embassy Suites La Jolla and Hilton San Diego Bayfront hotels are operated under management agreements with Hilton. The management agreement at the Embassy Suites La Jolla expires in 2026 (absent early termination by Hilton), and provides no renewal options. The agreement required us to pay a base management fee of 2.25% of gross revenue through 2016, decreasing to 1.75% of gross revenue thereafter. There is no incentive fee under the agreement. 
     The management agreement at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, which originally provided for an extension option at Hilton’s election up through 2033, was amended in February 2017, with the new expiration date established as December 31, 2046. The amended agreement provides no renewal options. The agreement requires us to pay a base fee of 2.5% of total revenue and an incentive fee of 15.0% of the excess of operating cash flow over a certain percentage.
     Hyatt. Our Hyatt Regency Newport Beach hotel is operated under a management agreement with Hyatt. The agreement expires in 2019 and provides either party the right to renew for successive periods of 10 years (provided that the term of the agreement shall in no event extend beyond 2039), absent early termination by either party. The agreement requires us to pay 3.5% of total hotel revenue as a base management fee, with an additional 0.5% of total revenue payable to Hyatt based upon the hotel achieving specific operating thresholds. The agreement also requires us to pay an incentive fee equal to 10.0% of the excess of adjusted profit over $2.0 million, and 5.0% of the excess of adjusted profit over $6.0 million.
     Our Hyatt Regency San Francisco hotel is operated by Hyatt under an operating lease with economics that follow a typical management fee structure. The lease expires in 2050, and provides no renewal options. Pursuant to the lease, Hyatt retains 3.0% of total revenue as a base management fee. The lease also provides Hyatt the opportunity to earn an incentive fee if gross operating profit exceeds certain thresholds.
     Davidson. Our Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile hotel is operated under a management agreement with Davidson. The management agreement at the Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile expires in 2019, and provides us with the right to renew for up to two additional terms of five years each, absent a prior termination by either party. The agreement requires us to pay 2.5% of total revenue as a base management fee and calls for an incentive fee of 10.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold, limited to 1.5% of total revenue. The base and incentive management fees payable to Davidson under the Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile management agreement have an aggregate cap of 4.0% of total revenue. 
     HEI. Our Hilton New Orleans St. Charles hotel is operated under a management agreement with HEI. The agreement expired in 2017, but currently automatically renews on a month-to-month basis. The agreement requires us to pay 2.0% of 

 
  7

 
gross revenue as a base management fee and calls for an incentive fee of 20.0% of the excess of adjusted gross operating profit over a certain threshold.
     Singh. Our Oceans Edge Hotel & Marina hotel is operated under a management agreement with Singh. The management agreement at the Oceans Edge Hotel & Marina expires in 2027 (absent early termination by either party), and provides no renewal options. The agreement requires us to pay 3.0% of gross revenue as a base management fee and calls for an incentive fee of 10.0% of adjusted net operating income, capped at 1.5% of gross revenue.
     The existing management agreements with Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt require the manager to furnish chain services that are generally made available to other hotels managed by that operator. Costs for these chain services are reimbursed by us. Such services include: (1) the development and operation of computer systems and reservation services; (2) management and administrative services; (3) marketing and sales services; (4) human resources training services; and (5) such additional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a national, regional or group level.
     Franchise Agreements
     As of December 31, 2017, 11 of the 25 hotels were operated subject to franchise agreements. Franchisors provide a variety of benefits to franchisees, including nationally recognized brands, centralized reservation systems, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel and maintenance of operational quality at hotels across the brand system.
     The franchise agreements generally specify management, operational, record-keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which our subsidiary, as the franchisee, must comply. The franchise agreements obligate the subsidiary to comply with the franchisors’ standards and requirements with respect to training of operational personnel, safety, maintaining specified insurance, the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided by the subsidiary, display of signage and the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. The franchise agreements for our hotels require that we reserve up to 5.0% of the gross revenues of the hotels into a reserve fund for capital expenditures.
     The franchise agreements also provide for termination at the franchisor’s option upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure to pay royalties and fees or to perform other obligations under the franchise license, bankruptcy and abandonment of the franchise or a change in control. The subsidiary that is the franchisee is responsible for making all payments under the franchise agreements to the franchisors; however, the Company guaranties certain obligations under a majority of the franchise agreements.
     Tax Status
     We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2004. Under current federal income tax laws, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders each year in order to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement. While REITs enjoy certain tax benefits relative to C corporations, as a REIT we may still be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. We may also be subject to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income.     Taxable REIT Subsidiary
     Subject to certain limitations, a REIT is permitted to own, directly or indirectly, up to 100% of the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. A TRS is a fully taxable corporation that may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by us. A TRS may perform activities such as development, and other independent business activities that may be prohibited to a REIT. A hotel REIT is permitted to own a TRS that leases hotels from the REIT, rather than requiring the lessee to be an unaffiliated third party, provided certain conditions are satisfied. However, a hotel leased to a TRS still must be managed by an unaffiliated third party in the business of managing hotels because a TRS may not directly or indirectly operate or manage any hotels or provide rights to any brand name under which any hotel is operated. The TRS provisions are complex and impose certain conditions on the use of TRSs. This is to assure that TRSs are subject to an appropriate level of federal corporate taxation.
     We and the TRS Lessee must make a joint election with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the TRS Lessee to be treated as a TRS. A corporation of which a qualifying TRS owns, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of the voting 

 
  8

 
power or value of the corporation’s stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more TRS, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. The 75% asset test generally requires that at least 75% of the value of our total assets be represented by real estate assets, cash, or government securities.
     The rent that we receive from a TRS qualifies as “rents from real property” as long as the property is operated on behalf of the TRS by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating “qualified lodging facilities” for any person unrelated to us and the TRS (an “eligible independent contractor”). A “qualified lodging facility” is a hotel, motel or other establishment in which more than one-half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis. A “qualified lodging facility” does not include any facility where wagering activities are conducted. A “qualified lodging facility” includes customary amenities and facilities operated as part of, or associated with, the lodging facility as long as such amenities and facilities are customary for other properties of a comparable size and class owned by other unrelated owners.
     We have formed the TRS Lessee as a wholly owned TRS. We lease each of our hotels to the TRS Lessee or one of its subsidiaries. These leases provide for a base rent plus variable rent based on occupied rooms and departmental gross revenues. These leases must contain economic terms which are similar to a lease between unrelated parties. If they do not, the IRS could impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between the TRS Lessee and us or our tenants that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. We believe that all transactions between us and the TRS Lessee are conducted on an arm’s-length basis. 
     The TRS Lessee has engaged eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels it leases from the Operating Partnership.
     Ground, Building and Air Lease Agreements
     At December 31, 2017, six of the 25 hotels are subject to ground, building and/or air leases with unaffiliated parties that cover either all or portions of their respective properties. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining terms of these ground, building and air leases (including renewal options) range from approximately 26 to 80 years. These leases generally require us to make rental payments and payments for all or portions of costs and expenses, including real and personal property taxes, insurance and utilities associated with the leased property.
     Any proposed sale of a property that is subject to a ground, building or air lease or any proposed assignment of our leasehold interest as lessee under the ground, building or air lease may require the consent of the applicable lessor. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our interest in any such property in the future absent the consent of the ground, building or air lessor, even if such transaction may be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
     Three of the six leases prohibit the sale or conveyance of the hotel and assignment of the lease by us to another party without first offering the lessor the opportunity to acquire our interest in the associated hotel and property upon the same terms and conditions as offered by us to the third party. Two of these same leases also allow us the option to acquire the ground or building lessor’s interest in the ground or building lease subject to certain exercisability provisions. From time to time, we evaluate our options to purchase the lessors’ interests in the leases. 
     Offices
     We currently lease our headquarters located at 120 Vantis, Suite 350, Aliso Viejo, California 92656 from an unaffiliated third party. We occupy our headquarters under a lease that terminates on August 30, 2018. During 2017, we entered into a new lease with an unaffiliated third party to occupy the premises located at 200 Spectrum Center Drive, Suite 2100, Irvine, California 92618. Our new lease begins on September 1, 2018 and terminates on August 31, 2028.     Employees
     As of February 1, 2018, we had 49 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are positive. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of the hotels are employees of the management companies engaged by the TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries to operate such hotels.

     Environmental
     Environmental reviews have been conducted on all of our hotels. From time to time, our secured lenders have requested environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments on many of our properties. In certain instances, these Phase I assessments relied on older environmental assessments prepared in connection with prior financings. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination of properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly available databases. Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties. In addition, material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may arise after the Phase I assessments are completed, or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liabilities.
     Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on the property. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, a person that arranges for the disposal or transports for disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance at another property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we or the TRS Lessee, as the case may be, may be potentially liable for such costs. Although we have tried to mitigate environmental risk through insurance, this insurance may not cover all or any of the environmental risks we encounter.
     As an owner of real estate, we are not directly involved in the operation of our properties or other activities that could produce meaningful levels of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, we have not implemented a formal program to measure or manage emissions associated with our corporate office or hotels. Although we do not believe that climate change represents a direct material risk to our business, we could be indirectly affected by climate change and other environmental issues to the extent these issues negatively affect the broader economy, result in increased regulation or costs, or have a negative impact on travel.
     We have provided unsecured environmental indemnities to certain lenders and buyers of our properties. We have performed due diligence on the potential environmental risks including obtaining an independent environmental review from outside environmental consultants. These indemnities obligate us to reimburse the guaranteed parties for damages related to environmental matters. There is generally no term or damage limitation on these indemnities; however, if an environmental matter arises, we could have recourse against other previous owners. 
     ADA Regulation
     Our properties must comply with various laws and regulations, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA; however, noncompliance with the ADA could result in capital expenditures, the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
     Inflation
