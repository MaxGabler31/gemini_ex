ITEM 1. | DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

(In millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to "ITT," "the Company," and such words as "we," "us," and "our" include ITT Inc. and its subsidiaries.
ITT is a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered critical components and customized technology solutions for the transportation, industrial, and oil and gas markets. We manufacture components that are integral to the operation of systems and manufacturing processes in these key markets. Our products provide enabling functionality for applications where reliability and performance are critically important to our customers and the users of their products. 
We are a global company with approximately 10,000 employees in approximately 35 countries and 2017 revenue of $2.6 billion, which we derived from sales in more than 100 countries. In 2017, 67% of our sales were outside the U.S., including 33% from emerging markets. Accordingly, approximately half of our manufacturing facilities are outside of the U.S. in order to achieve strategic proximity to customers, further increase global sales and market share, and lower costs. 
We have a balanced and diversified portfolio of businesses, which are organized in three segments – Industrial Process, Motion Technologies, and Connect & Control Technologies. Our businesses share a common, repeatable operating model centered on our engineering aptitude. Each business applies its technology and engineering expertise to solve some of the most pressing challenges of our customers. Our applied engineering provides a special business fit with our customers given the critical nature of their applications. This in turn provides us with unique insight into our customers' requirements and enables us to develop solutions to better assist our customers to achieve their business goals. Our technology and customer intimacy together produce opportunities to capture recurring revenue streams, aftermarket opportunities and long-lived platforms from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
We possess strong leading brands, such as Goulds Pumps, Bornemann, Engineered Valves, Cannon, VEAM, BIW Connector Systems, KONI, Axtone, Wolverine, Enidine, Aerospace Controls, and ITT, in many of our niche markets. These brands are associated with quality, reliability, durability, and engineering excellence. Our brands extend internationally and participate in emerging markets including China, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.

Industrial Products
Industrial Products designs and manufactures configured-to-order industry standards-based industrial pumps, valves, and equipment for both original equipment installations and replacement parts and pumps. These products include a broad portfolio of centrifugal process pumps and engineered industrial and sanitary valves. 
Engineered Systems
Engineered Systems provides highly engineered and customized pumping systems typically used in severe service conditions via both original equipment installations and replacement parts and pumps. Products include API (American Petroleum Institute) centrifugal pumps, vertical centrifugal pumps, twin screw and positive displacement pumps, and water systems. Our pumping systems are generally part of larger capital projects, which have longer lead times and are generally managed by EPC firms.
Aftermarket Solutions
Aftermarket Solutions provides customers with parts, services, and plant optimization solutions that reduce total cost of ownership for pumps and rotating equipment. In addition to providing standard repairs and upgrades, the business also develops engineered solutions for specific customer process issues. Examples include innovative technologies like PumpSmart Controllers and i-ALERT2 Equipment Health Monitoring Devices to control and monitor pumps and other rotating equipment in an industrial environment. 
IP goes to market via a global and diversified sales channel structure. End-users are serviced by an extensive network of independent industrial distributors, which account for approximately one-third of revenue, and representatives which complement our customer-focused direct sales and service organization. We also have focused channels dedicated to supporting EPC firms as their needs are often distinct from those of other distributors and end-user customers. 
The pump and valve markets served are highly competitive, especially in the last few years, due to uncertainty and volatility in the oil and gas market. For most of our products there are hundreds of regional competitors and a limited number of larger global peers. Primary customer purchase decision drivers include price, delivery terms, and on-time performance, brand recognition and reputation, perceived quality, breadth of product and service offerings, commercial terms, technical support and localization. Pricing can be very competitive for large projects because of overcapacity, fewer investment projects, and aftermarket opportunities for the original equipment provider. 
Motion Technologies
The Motion Technologies segment, commonly referred to as MT, is a manufacturer of braking pads, shims, shock absorbers, and energy absorption components, and sealing technologies primarily for the transportation industry, including passenger cars, light- and heavy-duty commercial and military vehicles, buses, and rail. MT consists of three business units, Friction Technologies, Wolverine, and KONI.
Friction Technologies
Our Friction Technologies business manufactures a range of brake pads installed as original equipment (OE) pads on passenger cars and light- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Demand for MT's products stem from a variety of end customers and automotive platforms around the world. OE pads are sold either directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or to Tier-1 brake manufacturers. Our OE pads are designed to meet customer specifications and environmental regulations, and to satisfy an array of performance standards and geographic applications. Most automobile OEM platforms (car model) require specific brake pad formulations and have demanding delivery and volume schedules.
Friction Technologies also manufactures aftermarket brake pads designed for the automotive service and repairs market. This market consists of both OE dealers, also referred to as original equipment spares (OES) networks, and independent aftermarket (AM) networks. Brake pads sold within the OES network generally match the specifications of an original auto platform OE brake pad, while our catalog of AM pads feature technology designed to provide a range of braking performance levels. Within the service and repairs market, pads are sold either directly to OE manufacturers or Tier-1 brake manufacturers (such as Continental or TRW) or indirectly through independent distributor channels. 
Combined sales to Continental and TRW, MT's two largest customers, were 35% of 2017 MT revenue, however, 43% of the Continental and TRW derived revenue is directly attributable to OES supply agreements signed directly with OEMs. Also, in many cases OEMs specify the use of our pads in a braking system with brake manufacturers, such as Continental and TRW.
Wolverine
Wolverine is a manufacturer of customized damping technologies for automotive braking systems and specialized gasket sealing solutions for harsh operating environments across a range of industries. Brake shims are thin metal and rubber adhesive dampeners that fit onto the brake pad and against the brake caliper to prevent excessive noise and vibration. Gaskets are an anti-vibration solution and a sealing solution that prevent fluid spillage with applications to engines, transmissions, exhaust systems, fuel systems, and a variety of pneumatic systems.
KONI & Axtone
The KONI and Axtone businesses are organized into three main product groups: railway rolling stock; car & racing; and bus, truck & trailer. 
Railway Rolling Stock provides a wide range of equipment for passenger rail, locomotives, freight cars, high speed trains and light rail. Offerings include customized energy absorption solutions, hydraulic shock absorbers (primary, lateral, and inter-car), yaw dampers, springs, visco-elastic and hydraulic buffers, and coupler components. Revenue opportunities for our rail damping systems are balanced between OE and AM customers. Sales are either directly to train manufacturers, train operators carrying out scheduled train maintenance programs, or indirectly through distributors. 
Car & Racing features performance shock absorbers often using our Frequency Selective Damping (FSD) technology. FSD products generally have been used by car and racing enthusiasts who desire to modify their cars for increased handling performance and comfort, and are now also being incorporated into OEM platform designs. KONI car shock absorbers are sold all over the world, through a distribution network that markets KONI products into specific geographies or customer groups.
Bus, Truck & Trailer manufactures shock absorbers and bus dampers, for sale to both OEM and AM customers.
MT has a market reputation, derived from many years of mutual collaboration with major OEMs, of customer satisfaction, quality and on-time delivery. MT has a global manufacturing footprint, with production facilities in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, China, and North America. 
MT competes in markets primarily served by large, well-established national and global companies. Key competitive drivers within the brake pad business include technical expertise, formulation development capabilities, scale production, product performance, high-quality standards, customer intimacy, reputation, and the ability to meet demanding delivery and volume schedules in a reduced amount of time. OE and OES customers usually require long-lasting and well-established relationships, based on mutual trust, local proximity and a wide range of cooperative activities, starting from the design to the sampling, prototyping and testing phases of brake pads. Within the independent AM pads market, MT is a leading European provider in a highly fragmented global market.
Competitive drivers in the rail damping systems business include price, technical expertise and product performance. Rail damping systems are considered critical components because of safety requirements and thus they have to be specifically designed according to many different train applications, and must satisfy strict compliance requirements. MT is a leader in the rail dampers component of the complete rail damper system in Europe and continues to gain market share in China.

Other Company Information
Materials
All of our businesses require various OEM products, manufactured components, and raw materials; the availability and prices of which may fluctuate. The principal OEM products and manufactured components assembled into our products include motors, castings, mechanical seals, machined castings, metal fabrications and miscellaneous metal, plastic, or electronic components. The primary raw materials used in manufacturing our products include steel, gold, copper, nickel, iron, aluminum, tin, and rubber, as well as specialty alloys, including titanium. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as sheet, bar, rod and wire stock, pellets, and metal powders.
Raw materials, supplies and product subassemblies are purchased from third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and commodity dealers. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such materials are readily available. In some instances we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers.
We continually monitor the business conditions of our supply chain to maintain our market position and to avoid potential supply disruptions. There have been no raw material shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business as a whole, and we have been able to develop a robust supply chain such that we do not anticipate shortages of such materials in the future.
Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are generally exposed to fluctuations due to inflation of prices for raw materials and commodities. When practical, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-priced contracts with suppliers. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for an average of four to eight weeks, with the exception of some specialty materials. From time to time, we experience price volatility or supply constraints for raw materials based on market supply and demand dynamics. In limited circumstances, we may have to obtain scarce components for higher prices on the spot market, which may have a negative impact on gross margin and can periodically create a disruption to production and delivery. We also acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. We evaluate hedging opportunities to mitigate or minimize the risk of operating margin erosion resulting from the volatility of commodity prices.
Manufacturing Methods
We utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: build-to-order and engineer-to-order. Build-to-order consists of assembling a group of products with the same pre-defined specifications, generally for our OEM customers. Engineer-to-order consists of assembling a customized system according to a customer’s individual order specifications. In both cases, we offer design, integration, test and other production value-added services. We employ build-to-order capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Engineering products-to-order permits the configuration of units to meet the customized requirements of our customers. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both build-to-order and engineer-to-order seek to minimize inventory holding periods, and improve customer delivery performance.
Backlog
Our backlog represents firm orders that have been received, acknowledged and entered into our production systems. Our backlog may vary due to market volatility or other changes in macroeconomic conditions. In addition, delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. For example, large complex projects in specialized markets such as oil and gas, chemical, and mining at IP require longer lead times and production cycles. Delivery delays could arise from supply chain limitations, internal production challenges, changes in the customer’s requirements, or technical difficulties. Total backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $869.7 and $785.1, respectively. Total backlog by segment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was: IP - $336.5 and $347.2; MT - $299.7 and $201.2; and CCT - $233.5 and $236.7. We expect to satisfy nearly all December 31, 2017 backlog commitments during 2018.
Intellectual Property
We generally seek patent protection for certain inventions and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our products or where proprietary rights are expected to improve our competitive position. The highly customized application engineering embedded within our products, our proprietary rights, and our knowledge capabilities all contribute to enhancing our competitive position.
While we own and control a significant number of patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our Company, as a whole, as well as each of our core segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications, and license agreements has evolved over a long period of time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent or other intellectual property right to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
Research and Development
Research and Development (R&D) is a key element of our engineering culture and is generally focused on the design and development of products and solutions that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends. Our approach to R&D often begins by working with our customers to address a problem, then engineering a solution to the particular customer need. As a result, our R&D is based on taking technology quickly to the tangible phase, increasing the competitive offering, and increasing the customer service experience through engineered application solutions. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized R&D expenses of $93.7, $80.8, and $78.9, respectively, which were 3.6%, 3.4%, and 3.2%, of revenues, respectively.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Many of the businesses in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. We consider our connector products in our CCT segment to be an early cycle business, meaning it generally is impacted more in the early portion of an economic cycle, while the automotive and aerospace components businesses tend to be impacted in the middle portion of the cycle and the industrial pump business typically is impacted late in the economic cycle.
Our businesses experience limited seasonal variations, with demand generally lower during summer months (our third quarter) mainly attributable to manufacturing shutdowns and the planned industrial maintenance activities of our customers. Revenue impacts from the limited seasonal variations are typically mitigated by our backlog of orders that allow us to adjust levels of production across the summer months.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, water discharges and waste disposal. In the U.S., these include, but are not limited to, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Environmental requirements are significant factors affecting our operations. We have established an internal program to assess compliance with applicable environmental requirements at our facilities. The program, which includes periodic audits of many of our locations, including our major operating facilities, is designed to identify problems in a timely manner, correct deficiencies and prevent future noncompliance.
We closely monitor our environmental responsibilities, together with trends in environmental laws. In addition, we have purchased insurance protection against certain environmental risks arising from our business activities. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, however, and the nature and timing of such changes, if any, is difficult to predict. As actual costs incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from our current estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, management believes it is possible that the outcome of these uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, as well as Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 10,000 employees, of which approximately 3,100 were located in the U.S. Approximately 20% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. We also have unionized employees in Italy, Germany, and Brazil. No one unionized facility accounts for more than 11% of ITT's total revenues. Although our relations with our employees are strong and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages recently, we can provide no assurance that we will not experience these or other types of conflict with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor.
