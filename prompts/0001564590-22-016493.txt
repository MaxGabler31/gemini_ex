Company Overview
 CalAmp Corp. (including its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, “CalAmp”, “the Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a connected intelligence company that leverages a data-driven solutions ecosystem to help people and organizations improve operational performance. We solve complex problems for customers within the market verticals of transportation and logistics, commercial and government fleets, industrial equipment, and consumer vehicles by providing solutions that track, monitor, and recover their vital assets. The data and insights enabled by CalAmp solutions provide real-time visibility into a user’s vehicles, assets, drivers, and cargo, giving organizations greater understanding and control of their operations. Ultimately, these insights drive operational visibility, safety, efficiency, maintenance, and sustainability for organizations around the world.
 Currently, CalAmp is generating data for a global customer portfolio across an installed base of approximately 10 million devices reporting to our cloud-based platform. The magnitude and diversity of this data generation has played an instrumental role in the development of our flexible and scalable cloud platform, the CalAmp Telematics Cloud™ (“CTC”). CTC’s ability to ingest vast amounts and types of data is critical to the company’s long-term strategy of providing differentiated insights to customers with a wide variety of needs and use cases. The platform also serves as the backbone for CalAmp’s software applications, which offer user-friendly interfaces to interact with the data and insights produced at the edge and in the cloud. Finally, to better address customer needs and enable a focused investment strategy, CalAmp is focused on enabling partnerships with third-party organizations, integrating devices, services, and application features into our consolidated solutions.  
 CalAmp’s ability to provide a full stack solution to end-users across the globe uniquely positions the company to capitalize on a $62 billion total addressable market (“TAM”) that is growing at a 5-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20%.1 The market in which we compete is highly fragmented, with the majority of competitors serving a range of subsets of CalAmp’s addressable market. We believe that this fragmentation will allow CalAmp to offer unparalleled value through a consolidated solution set. The company is focusing on transforming towards this vision by building out data-driven solutions, a robust portfolio of partners, and a world-class team of people.
 The complexity that exists within CalAmp’s operating environment continues to be primarily driven by macro-economic conditions, competitive markets, global regulatory environments, technological evolution, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other macro-political and economic factors. We believe that the effect that these factors have on our customers further substantiates and augments the value of our solutions. As our customers’ operating complexity and costs continue to rise, the deployment of advanced telematics solutions becomes even more imperative. To maintain or enhance market share, revenue, profitability, and customer satisfaction, our customers require optimally efficient operating strategies, enabled by the visibility that CalAmp solutions provide.

Our Solutions
 

CalAmp Telematics Cloud (“CTC”). Since not all customers’ needs are the same, CalAmp offers flexible solutions to meet the requirements of varying organizations, business processes and operational strategies.  At the core of the CalAmp approach is the CTC platform.  This dependable and highly scalable platform seamlessly integrates with CalAmp’s edge computing products to provide customers detailed information and insights via Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”).  The information captured here helps companies more efficiently manage their vital assets including fleet video intelligence, remote asset tracking, real-time crash response and driver behavior scoring, among others.  Customers can choose to access this information via intuitive purpose-built SaaS applications and/or they can programmatically integrate information from CTC with their own custom in-house applications and workflows using open Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) also offered by CalAmp.  In this way, customers who want a complete turnkey solution can quickly leverage CalAmp’s information and insights while those customers wishing to integrate that information into their own applications and processes can easily do so, also.  
 Intuitive SaaS Applications. We provide our customers with intelligent analytics and reporting solutions that are accessible via a single view, user-friendly interface through a SaaS-based application designed to address market needs. This application, called CalAmp iOn™, is purpose-built for fleets, transportation and logistics needs, and industrial equipment, turning multiple data feeds from previously unconnected networks of vehicles, drivers and associated assets into clear and actionable insights that optimize operations, increase productivity and deliver compelling return on investment for virtually any business challenge. The applications also deliver real-time visibility about the location and environmental status of pharmaceuticals, electronics, food or other perishables from the manufacturing plant or point of origin to the point of delivery, helping to manage quality and compliance across land, air or sea shipments. Our K-through-12 solutions include Here Comes The Bus®, an award-winning mobile

Bus Guardian™ enables contact tracing and hygiene verification to keep students, drivers and other school staff safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 CalAmp Marketplace. The CalAmp Marketplace provides enhanced contextual information from third party systems or partners that augment the core telematics data being captured by CTC to provide customers with improved understanding of their business. Examples of these value-added insights include crash detection and notifications that speed life-saving assistance to drivers and fleet operators, and predictive remote diagnostics that enable preemptive alerts about vehicle issues before critical failures occur. This valued-added information provided by all the CalAmp Marketplace offerings bolsters the value we provide customers while also improving customer retention rates.  
 Developer Portal. The CalAmp Telematics Cloud is the core engine that enables seamless management of data through a diverse set of assets, from service vehicles to high-value equipment. CTC is an enablement platform that connects our customers to edge data and insights for a wide range of applications and software services. Through CTC CalAmp provides the Developer Portal to facilitate integration with third-party applications through open APIs. Our partners leverage the multiple APIs we’ve created to rapidly deliver full-featured telematics solutions to their customers and markets. Our proven CTC platform is architected to integrate with numerous global Mobile Network Operator account management systems and leverage these carrier backend systems to provide customers access to services that are essential for creating and managing flexible end-to-end solutions.
 Flexible Edge Computing Products. We offer a series of telematics edge products that serve as the foundation of our mobile connected ecosystem by collecting data insights from vehicles, drivers, assets, and cargo.  These wireless enabled devices--including asset tracking units, mobile telematics devices, fixed and mobile wireless gateways and routers--underpin our wide range of proprietary and third-party software applications and services for business-critical deployments demanding secure and reliable communications and controls anywhere in the world. Our customers select our products and solutions based on optimized feature sets, programmability, configurability, manageability, long-term support, reliability and, in particular, overall value. 
Growth Strategy – Capitalize on $62B Total Addressable Market 
 Over the past several years, CalAmp has been focused on growing our subscription-based business through expanded data and application-driven solutions offerings. This transition has been driven by our desire to enhance the customer experience and maximize the value proposition that we provide our customers. By transforming our business model and solutions portfolio to focus on data-driven insights and the application experience, CalAmp offers customers the value and convenience of a consolidated full stack solution, while providing shareholders with the confidence that accompanies an increasingly recurring and predictable revenue model. 
 CalAmp operates at the nexus of several large market opportunities, including fleet, transportation and logistics, supply chain and connected-vehicle ecosystems, which includes tracking, monitoring, and recovering high-value vehicles, equipment, cargo and other vital assets in the markets around the world.

Customer Benefits
 Our software and subscription services solutions and edge-computing products are deployed in a wide variety of applications across key market verticals ranging from small to large enterprises. Companies using CalAmp’s solutions require constant communication with remote and/or mobile assets as they perform business-critical tasks and services that are otherwise difficult to manage in real time. Our solutions provide a clear and demonstrable return on investment for these customers by:

• | Improving efficiency, cost savings and sustainability. CalAmp’s solutions enable customers to gain better control and visibility of how their drivers, cargo, assets and vehicles are operating. With this information they are better able to streamline and optimize their operations which reduces fuel usage, decreases labor costs and improves overall efficiency. Additionally, using less fuel reduces the carbon footprint of an organization and helps them in reaching their sustainability goals. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving tracking and transparency. One of the most important benefits our customers receive by using CalAmp’s solutions is gaining greater understanding of where and how their assets, vehicles, and cargo are being used. The insights we provide help organizations operate more effectively, provide better support to both their internal and external customers, and ensure that their resources are being properly deployed, used and delivered. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing safety and compliance. Because our solutions enable fleet operators to track, monitor and gain greater transparency of how their vehicles and assets are being used, they also allow customers to improve the behavior of employees which bolsters safety while also ensuring personnel are complying with governance policies. Additionally, for K-through-12 students all over the U.S. and Canada, our proprietary school bus tracking and mobile app provide pick-up and drop-off information to give parents and students peace of mind as they travel to and from school. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Better maintenance and increased uptime. CalAmp’s solutions provide visibility into maintenance, usage, and tracking of on- and off-road high-value assets including assets like vehicles, “yellow-iron” and attachments, forklifts and loaders to generators, compressors and other mission-critical equipment. The detailed insights into information like engine hours, impact and other diagnostics help our customers head off issues before they occur in order to improve overall equipment/fleet uptime.

Manufacturing and Operations 
 While our products are largely designed in the U.S., we currently outsource our manufacturing to certain contract manufacturers in Taiwan, Malaysia and Mexico as well as some limited production in China and Hong Kong. The devices, components and assemblies used in our solutions and products can be obtained from these manufacturers, although a few components are obtained from sole source suppliers. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed product supply agreements with these manufacturers, which provide for certain product quality requirements. We are not vertically integrated, which provides us with flexibility and an ability to adapt to changes in the market, product supply and pricing while keeping our fixed costs low. Our relationships with our 
 5


manufacturers are critical to the success of our business. We have strong relationships with our manufacturers, helping us to meet supply and support requirements stipulated by our customers. 
 We focus on driving alignment of our solutions and product roadmaps with all our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations team based in the U.S. coordinates with our manufacturers’ engineers and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing as well as a general oversight of ongoing manufacturing activities. We believe this model has allowed us to deliver high quality and innovative products in a timely manner while enabling us to minimize costs, manage inventory risk and maintain flexibility.
 We and our contract manufacturers are certified to the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 9001 quality management systems standard. 
 Research and Development
 We compete in markets characterized by industry disruption, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new product features. We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to develop innovative new products and solutions as well as enhancements to our existing products and solutions with advanced functionality and ease of use to drive customer demand and to further enhance our global brand and drive recurring revenue. We will continue to focus our research and development resources primarily on developing telematics products, services and software solutions for fleet management, heavy equipment monitoring and optimization, stolen vehicle recovery, consumer aftermarket telematics, trailer and asset tracking, transportation and logistics, and industrial monitoring. We have developed a technology platform that can be leveraged across many of our vertical markets, applications and geographic regions. This includes a cloud-based telematics application enablement platform and end-user software applications, a comprehensive purpose-built telematics edge platform, cellular and satellite communications network-based asset tracking units as well as 4G and 5G LTE broadband router products primarily for mobile applications. In addition, our development resources have been allocated to rationalizing existing product lines, reducing product costs, and improving performance through product redesign efforts. Our research and development efforts have resulted in generating significant intellectual property in the telematics vertical as is evident in our broad patent portfolio. We continue to actively pursue developing innovative solutions that add to our intellectual property portfolio.
 Our research and development expenses from continuing operations in fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $28.4 million, $25.8 million and $27.0 million, respectively. During this three-year period, our research and development expenses have ranged between 8% and 10% of annual consolidated revenues.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our solutions and services through our global direct sales organization, channel partner program and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) sales organizations while driving awareness through our websites and digital presence. Our global direct sales organization consists of teams of field salespeople, key account managers and business development managers, who work closely with solutions and applications specialists and other internal sales support personnel. We have organized our field sales personnel, together with internal sales and field support personnel, into teams within each business group based on their specialized knowledge and expertise relating to specific solutions and service areas, geographies and customer groups. These sales teams are closely aligned with their respective solutions management, engineering and operations organizations. 
 We sell our solutions and services to large global enterprises, small- to mid-sized companies, channel accounts and distributors as well as industrial OEM customers. These categories of customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements, and we have organized our sales teams to address these distinct requirements. Additionally, certain customers often have unique technical requirements and manufacturing processes, and may request specific system configurations, feature sets and designs. Sales to large enterprise customers often involve complex program management and long sales cycles, and require close cooperation between sales, operations and engineering personnel. As such, we have developed teams of key account managers and business development managers to serve the unique requirements of these customers.
 We also actively sell our products in certain markets through independent sales representatives and distributors. In some cases, we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain products in 
 6


specific geographic areas. These agreements generally have a term of one year, which automatically renews on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party following a specified notice period. 
 
We will continue our investment in sales and marketing programs that further build brand awareness, improve revenue generation and foster long-term relationships with our customers. Our marketing programs are focused on supporting multi-channel product launches in new geographic markets.
 
Additionally, we are focused on maximizing our efficiency and the reach of our marketing spend by investing in product marketing, content development, public relations, social media and digital marketing programs. These programs are developed to educate our potential customers and other industry influencers to drive sales engagement around our products and services. Our activities around product marketing, content development, public relations, thought leadership, social media and digital marketing are aligned with our customary product launches, media campaigns and presence at tradeshows and high exposure venues focused in the transportation and logistics sector such as Technology and Maintenance Council (TMC), Management Conference & Exhibition (MCE) and other high-profile industry events, as such in-person events recommence amid easing of COVID-19 restrictions. 
 Competition
 Our markets are highly competitive. We face competition from small to large public and private competitors some of which have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources as well as greater economies of scale than we do. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products and services are global scale, innovation, reputation, customer service, product quality, functionality and reliability, time-to-market, responsiveness and price. We believe that we compete favorably in all of these areas. Our continued success in our vertical markets will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate, design quality products and deploy solutions at competitive prices and with superior support services to our customers.
 The competitive landscape is incredibly fragmented, and most companies offer solutions to solve the needs of specific verticals, sub verticals, or asset classes. For instance, many companies specialize in cab and fleet visibility, such as Geotab and Verizon Connect, while others specialize in trailer visibility, like Phillips Connect, Sky Bitz, and Xirgo. However, we also encounter competitors like Keep Truckin’ and Samsara, who specialize in multiple verticals.
 Backlog 
 
Total consolidated backlog, comprised of our remaining performance obligations for software & subscription services and telematics devices backlog aggregated $285 million at February 28, 2022, compared to $211 million at February 28, 2021.
 
As of February 28, 2022, our remaining contractual performance obligations for software & subscription services were $202 million as compared to $145 million as of February 28, 2021. The majority of our growth in contractual performance obligations was driven by new customer acquisitions within the government and municipalities and connected car markets as well as the conversion of several significant telematics products customers to multi-year subscription contracts in the fleet market. We expect to recognize approximately 47% of our remaining contractual performance obligations in fiscal 2023. 
 
Total backlog for our telematics devices as of February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021 was $83 million and $66 million, respectively. Substantially all of the backlog at February 28, 2022 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2023. Our backlog for telematics devices increased year-over-year as we experienced significant supply shortages which were primarily attributable to global supply imbalances caused by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we drive toward a SaaS business model, we expect that a significant portion of the February 28, 2022 telematics devices backlog will ultimately be bundled and fulfilled in connection with multi-year subscription contracts.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, 
 7


such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, we often rely on inbound licenses of intellectual property for use in our business.
 We own and utilize the tradename “CalAmp” as well as the related logos and trademarks on many of our products and solutions. We believe that having distinctive marks that are registered and readily identifiable is an important factor in identifying our brand. We own over 200 active trademark applications and registrations throughout the world, with approximately 30 pending and registered trademarks in the U.S. 
 In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, manufacturers, and others. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. 
 As of February 28, 2022, we had nearly 300 patents worldwide. In addition to our awarded patents, we have approximately 70 patent applications in process. Although a number of these trademarks, and patents relate to software and products that are significant to our business and operations, we do not believe we are dependent on a single trademark, copyright or patent. 
 Governmental Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the clean-up of contaminated sites, and close oversight of our products’ material compliance including adherence to relevant EPA regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us.
 We have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws.
 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
 We believe responsible and sustainable business practices support our long-term success. As a company, we are deeply committed to protecting and supporting our people, our environment, and our communities. That commitment is reflected through various corporate initiatives as well as day-to-day activities, including our adoption of sustainability-focused policies and procedures, our publicly recognized focus on fostering an inclusive workplace, our constant drive toward more efficient use of materials and energy, our careful and active management of our supply chain, our services and products which help reduce carbon footprints and enhance road safety, and our impactful, globally integrated ethics and compliance program.

• | We seek to protect the human rights and civil liberties of our employees and the employees of our contract manufacturers through policies, procedures, and programs aimed at avoiding risks of compulsory and child labor, both within our company and throughout our supply chain.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We foster a workplace of dignity, respect, diversity, and inclusion through our recruiting and advancement practices, internal communications, and employee resource groups.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We educate our employees annually on relevant ethics and compliance topics, publish accessible guidance on ethical issues and related company resources in our global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and encourage reporting of ethical concerns through any one of several global and local reporting channels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We innovate to reduce the energy used by our products, the energy used to manufacture them, and the amount of new materials required to manufacture them.

 Recent Developments
 COVID-19 and Global Supply Imbalances
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 (“COVID-19” or the “pandemic”) to be a public health pandemic of international concern, which has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. The pandemic continues to have widespread and unpredictable impact on global economies, financial markets, and business practices, and continues to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers and suppliers. During fiscal 2021, our revenues were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as various small-to-medium sized customers postponed expenditures due to the pandemic and related macro-economic uncertainties. During fiscal 2022, we experienced supply shortages as a result of global supply imbalances initially driven by the global pandemic. These global supply imbalances have negatively impacted all parts of our business and operations during fiscal 2022, both in the form of reduced availability of devices as well as increased costs to procure available devices. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our future business or

operating results, which are highly dependent on uncertain future developments, including actions taken or to be taken by governments and private businesses in relation to its containment and the resolution of supply chain issues and supply shortages. Because our business is dependent on telematics product fulfillment, device installations and related subscription-based services, the ultimate effect of COVID-19 and the current supply shortages may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.
