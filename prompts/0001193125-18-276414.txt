Introduction 
 Our Business 
 We are a specialty biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic products for the treatment of eye diseases. Our lead product, DEXYCU (dexamethasone intraocular suspension) 9%, approved by the United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2018, is administered as a single dose at the end of ocular surgery and is the first long-acting intraocular product approved by the FDA for the treatment of post-operative ocular inflammation. DEXYCU utilizes our proprietary Verisome® drug-delivery platform, which allows for a single intraocular injection that releases dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, over time. There are approximately four million cataract surgeries performed annually in the U.S., and we plan to launch DEXYCU in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019 with a primary focus on its use following cataract surgery. Our lead product candidate is YUTIQ, a three-year non-erodible fluocinolone acetonide, or FA, insert for the treatment of non-infectious posterior segment uveitis,

  or NIPU. Injected into the eye in an office visit, YUTIQ is a tiny micro-insert that delivers a micro-dose of a corticosteroid to the back of the eye on a sustained constant (zero order release) basis for approximately three years. On March 19, 2018, the FDA accepted our New Drug Application, or NDA, for YUTIQ and set an FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of November 5, 2018. YUTIQ is based on our proprietary Durasert sustained-release drug delivery technology platform, which can deliver drugs for predetermined periods of time ranging from months to years. Posterior segment uveitis is the third leading cause of blindness in the U.S. and affects between 55,000 to 120,000 people in the U.S. If approved in November 2018, we expect to launch YUTIQ in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019. 
 The Unmet Need in the Treatment of Eye Disease 
 The human eye is an organ which reacts to light to provide sight. The eye has two principal anatomical segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior segment consists of the cornea, iris, pupil, lens and aqueous humor, while the posterior segment consists of the retina, choroid, vitreous humor and the optic nerve. 
 The tissues and structures in the anterior and posterior segment of the eye work in concert to produce sight. Light from an object or scene enters the eye through the anterior chamber, beginning with the cornea. The cornea bends the light such that it passes freely through the pupil, which is the opening in the center of the iris. The iris works like a shutter in a camera, enlarging or shrinking depending on how much light is entering the eye. After passing through the iris, the light rays pass through the eyes natural crystalline lens. This clear, flexible structure works like the lens in a camera, shortening and lengthening its width in order to focus light rays properly. Light rays then pass from the anterior segment into the posterior segment of the eye starting with a dense, transparent gel-like substance, called the vitreous. The vitreous fills the globe of the eyeball, which bathes the eye in nutrients and helps the eye hold its spherical shape. In a normal eye, the light rays come to a sharp focusing point on the retina. The retina functions much like the film in a camera, capturing the light rays, processing them into light impulses through millions of tiny nerve endings and then sending these light impulses through over a million nerve fibers to the optic nerve. Because the process of producing sight requires the precise coordination of the tissues and structures in both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, if disease affects any one of these components, vision can be impaired or potentially blinded. 
 Diseases of the anterior chamber of the eye include ocular inflammation, cataracts, dry eye, infection, and refractive disorders. Glaucoma, which is a disease that damages the optic nerve, can also be caused by inflammation in the anterior chamber (inflammatory or uveitic glaucoma). Because the anterior segment is readily accessible, physicians typically treat these diseases with topically-applied eye drops. However, there are several limitations of eye drops. First, the eye often eliminates topically applied medications via tear elimination, limiting the penetration of drugs into the ocular tissue. Second, eye drops are often administered by patients themselves, which often leads to misuse or non-compliance by patients due to complicated and arduous eye drop regimens. 
 Diseases of the posterior segment of the eye include conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or DME, and posterior segment uveitis. These diseases frequently result in damage to the vasculature of the eye, leading to poor visual function, and often to proliferation of new, abnormal and leaky blood vessels in the back of the eye. These conditions can lead to retinal damage, scarring and irreversible loss of vision. Because the posterior chamber is not readily accessible, physicians typically treat these diseases with intravitreal injections. However, there are several limitations of intravitreal injections. First, these injections can be painful to the eye and often cause swelling or bleeding. Second, intravitreal injections are not an effective means of delivering a steady state dose to the site of disease. 
 Drug delivery for treating ophthalmic diseases in both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye is a significant challenge. Due to the effectiveness of the blood-eye barrier, it is difficult for systemically (orally or 
 
3 


  intravenously) administered drugs to reach the retina in sufficient quantities to have a beneficial effect without causing adverse side effects to other parts of the body. Injecting drugs in solution directly into the back of the eye can achieve effective, but often transient, dosage levels in the eye, requiring repeated injections. In addition to the issues of inconvenience, cost and noncompliance, repeated intravitreal injections have medical risks, including intraocular infection, perforated sclera and vitreous hemorrhage. 
 Ophthalmic drugs, whether drops, injections or oral dosage forms, are often not administered on the optimal schedule or at all, because patients do not self-administer as prescribed or do not get medical professional administration as required. The risk of patient non-compliance increases when treatment involves multiple products or complex or painful dosing regimens, as patients age or suffer cognitive impairment or serious illness, or when the treatment is lengthy or expensive. 
 Due to the drawbacks of traditional delivery, we believe the development of methods to deliver drugs to patients in a more precise, controlled fashion over sustained periods of time satisfies an unmet medical need by assuring compliance to the prescribed treatment regimen. Our products, DEXYCU and, if approved, YUTIQ are intended to address diseases of both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, respectively, through long-acting and sustained delivery technologies.

 DEXYCU 
 DEXYCU is the first long-acting intraocular product approved by the FDA for the treatment of post-operative ocular inflammation. Cataract surgery is one of the most frequent surgical procedures performed in the U.S., with approximately four million procedures performed annually. However, patients can experience post-operative ocular inflammation. Under the current standard of care for inflammation associated with cataract surgery, patients, many of whom are elderly, must self-administer medicated eye drops several times a day over a period of several weeks. DEXYCU, administered as a single intraocular injection at the conclusion of surgery, utilizes our Verisome technology to dispense a biodegradable extended-release formulation of dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, in the posterior chamber directly behind the iris. We believe that a single administration of a corticosteroid at the site of inflammation may benefit patients by eliminating non-compliance and dosing errors associated with the current practice of dispensing multiple daily self-administered eye drops following cataract surgery over a period of several weeks. 
 The efficacy of DEXYCU was demonstrated in a double-masked randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of 394 patients. In the clinical trial, patients received an intraocular dose of 517 micrograms, or mcg, of DEXYCU, 342 mcg of DEXYCU, or placebo administered by a physician at the end of cataract surgery. The primary efficacy outcome in the clinical trial was anterior chamber cell clearing in the study eye on the eighth day following surgery. The percentage of patients meeting the primary efficacy outcome was 20% in the placebo group while 57% and 60% met the primary efficacy outcome in the 342 and 517 mcg DEXYCU treatment groups, respectively. In addition, the percentage of patients receiving rescue medication of ocular steroid or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug was significantly lower at day one, three, eight, 15 and 30 in the 342 and 517 mcg treatment groups versus placebo. The most common adverse reactions (5  15%) reported with DEXYCU were increased intraocular pressure, or IOP, corneal edema and iritis. Other adverse reactions occurring in 1  5% of subjects included corneal endothelial cell loss, blepharitis, eye pain, cystoid macular edema, dry eye, ocular inflammation, posterior capsule opacification, blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, vitreous floaters, foreign body sensation, photophobia and vitreous detachment. Warnings and precautions included on the label for DEXYCU include increases in IOP, delayed healing, exacerbation of infection and cataract progression which are side effects generally associated with intraocular steroids. 
 The FDA-approved dosage of DEXYCU is 0.005 milliliters, or mL, of dexamethasone 9% (equivalent to 517 mcg), administered as a single dose intraocularly in the posterior chamber, directly behind the iris, at the end of surgery. DEXYCU will be available as a 9% intraocular suspension equivalent to dexamethasone 103.4 mg/mL in a single-dose vial provided in a kit. The drug is encapsulated in the fully bioerodible Verisome technology, which provides a steady release of dexamethasone for up to 22 days post-injection. 
 We acquired the rights to DEXYCU on March 28, 2018 through the acquisition of Icon Bioscience, Inc., or Icon. We paid Icons security holders approximately $15 million at the closing of the transaction, and are obligated to pay certain post-closing contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified milestones based upon certain net sales and partnering revenue standards, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 28, 2018, by and among us, Oculus Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, Icon and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, solely in its capacity as the representative of Icons securityholders, which we refer to as the Merger Agreement. These include, but are not limited to, (i) a one-time development milestone of $15.0 million payable in cash upon the first commercial sale of DEXYCU in the U.S., (ii) sales milestone payments totaling up to $95.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds and subject to certain Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, reimbursement conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (iii) quarterly earn-out payments equal to 12% on net sales of DEXYCU in a given year, which earn-out payments will increase to 16% of net sales of DEXYCU in such year beginning in the calendar quarter for such year to the extent aggregate annual consideration of DEXYCU exceeds $200.0 million in such year, (iv) quarterly earn-out payments equal to 20% of partnering revenue received by us for DEXYCU sales outside of the U.S., and (v) single-digit percentage quarterly earn-out payments with respect to net sales and/or partnering income, if any, resulting from future clinical development, 
 
5 


  regulatory approval and commercialization of any other product candidates we acquired in connection with the acquisition of Icon. 
 We plan to launch DEXYCU in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019 following the successful scale up of commercial infrastructure and commercial supplies. We plan to commercialize DEXYCU ourselves in the U.S. through a contract sales organization, or CSO, whereby the sales leadership (National Sales Director and Regional Managers) are hired by us, and the key account managers, or KAMs, and sales representatives are hired by the CSO with the option for us to hire these sales reps after a period of time. We believe this flexible sales model provides less execution risk to us as CSOs can leverage costs across multiple clients, and thus are able to cost-effectively build the necessary infrastructure to support sales activities using varied, industry-wide experience to provide the most impactful solutions. 
 We believe that approximately four million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. The current standard of care in the U.S. for treating post-operative inflammation is primarily a combination of steroid, antibiotic and non-steroidal eye drops on a tapered treatment regimen that can last up to four weeks. This eye drop treatment regimen is complicated and can result in up to 100 eye drops being administered over time. Steroid eye drops are the most complicated medication to administer in this regimen, requiring up to 70 eye drops over 3-4 weeks on a tapered dosing schedule. Further, cataract surgery patients are often elderly and can have compromised cognitive function, osteoarthritis in their hands and poor eyesight due to the cataract surgery. These complexities can lead to poor compliance due to failing to administer eye drops according to the prescribed schedule, or administering an eye drop but failing to have it go into the eye, and/or not finishing the treatment regimen. In addition, patients often call their physicians office multiple times to have them re-explain the treatment regimen. We believe DEXYCU addresses many of these issues and potentially eliminates the need for post-surgical steroid eye drops by providing one injection immediately post-surgery into the same incision site where the new intraocular lens has been placed. We believe physicians will react positively to this single injection because the full steroid dose will be placed at the surgical site where inflammation can occur post-surgery. 
 Approximately 40% of patients who undergo cataract surgery are covered by Medicare Part B. New drugs approved by the FDA that are part of cataract surgery performed in a hospital outpatient department or ambulatory surgical center may receive an additional transitional pass-through payment under Medicare provided it meets certain criteria, including a not insignificant cost criterion. This pass-through payment consists of Medicare reimbursement for the drug based on a defined formula for calculating the minimum fee that a manufacturer may charge for the drug. 
 DEXYCU qualified for Medicare transitional pass-through payment and we received a pass-through C-code from CMS, which will be effective on October 1, 2018. We have not yet determined final pricing, other than that it will be modestly higher than $485 to ensure we will continue to qualify for pass-through status after including normal industry discounts and rebates given to providers or commercial payors. 
 Under current CMS regulations, pass-through status applies for a period of three years, measured from the date Medicare makes its first pass-through payment for DEXYCU, following which DEXYCU would be incorporated into the cataract bundled payment system, which will significantly reduce the pricing for DEXYCU. We are working with outside consultants to potentially gain an extension to the transitional payment system, or to separate the drug payment from the bundled cataract surgery payment after the three-year transitional payment ends and continue to be reimbursed separately for a longer period of time, potentially through patent life. 
 Our DEXYCU U.S. patent portfolio includes two issued patents under an exclusive license from Ramscor, Inc. for all ophthalmic conditions. These two issued patents contain composition claims for delivering biologically active substances using citric acid esters. In addition, two more U.S. applications pertaining to DEXYCU have issued as patents. These patents, one with method of use claims and the other with device claims, will provide further protection for DEXYCU through May 2034.

 The drug delivery technology used in DEXYCU is called Verisome. The basic technology can be formulated into numerous products, as a biodegradable solid, gel, or liquid substance that provides drug release in a controlled manner over a period of weeks to several months for ocular, systemic, or topical applications. Ophthalmic applications are focused on the ability of this system to create an injectable liquid or slightly viscous gel. Verisome-based products can be injected into the aqueous or vitreous humor as a liquid via a small gauge needle. When the drug is injected into an ocular chamber, it coalesces into a single spherical dose that settles in the lower portion of the chamber. The system is biodegradable and versatile for administering different drugs; furthermore, duration of use can be tailored. Shrinkage of the Verisome sphere over time reflects simultaneous degradation of the delivery system and release of the active agent. In ophthalmology, this mode of delivery offers advantages because the physician can easily assess the status of therapy by observing the drug-containing system within the eye. When the sphere is no longer visible, the entire drug has been released, and no inactive ingredient remains in the eye. Potential applications could include intraocular products to treat inflammation, ocular hypertension and glaucoma. 
 Durasert Technology Platform 
 Our Durasert technology platform uses proprietary sustained polymer technology to deliver drugs to treat chronic diseases, especially those affecting the hard to access posterior segment of the eye. To date, three products utilizing successive generations of the Durasert technology have been approved by the FDA. These products include ILUVIEN® (FA intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg, licensed to Alimera Sciences, Inc., or Alimera, and Retisert® (FA intravitreal implant) 0.59 mg and Vitrasert® (ganciclovir) 4.5 mg, both licensed to Bausch & Lomb. Currently, the Durasert technology platform utilizes a miniaturized, injectable, sustained-release insert for small molecules that can deliver a drug for up to three years. This insert is only 3.5 mm in length with an external diameter of just 0.37 mm. The insert can be administered in an office setting through a needle as small as 25-gauge.
Our Durasert technology platform is designed to address the issue of sustained delivery for ophthalmic and other product candidates. Specifically, our Durasert platform features: 
 

 | Extended Delivery. The delivery of drugs for predetermined periods of time ranging from months to years. We believe that uninterrupted, sustained delivery offers the opportunity to develop products that reduce the need for repeated applications, thereby reducing the risks of patient noncompliance and adverse effects from repeated administrations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Controlled Release Rate. The release of therapeutics at a controlled rate. We believe that this feature allows us to develop products that deliver optimal concentrations of therapeutics over time and eliminate excessive variability in dosing during treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Localized Delivery. The delivery of therapeutics directly to a target site. We believe this administration can allow the natural barriers of the body to isolate and assist in maintaining appropriate concentrations at the target site in an effort to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect while minimizing unwanted systemic effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Durasert technology platform provides sustained, localized delivery of small molecule drugs to the posterior segment of the eye and is utilized in three FDA-approved products and in our product candidates, including YUTIQ and other shorter duration product candidates. In these products and product candidates, a drug core is surrounded with one or more polymer layers, and the permeability of those layers and other design aspects of the product or product candidate control the rate and duration of drug release. By changing elements of the design, we can alter both the rate and duration of release to meet different therapeutic needs. Although the earlier ophthalmic products that utilize the Durasert technology, Retisert and Vitrasert, are surgically implanted, ILUVIEN, YUTIQ and our other ophthalmic product candidates are designed to be injected at the target site in an office visit.

 YUTIQ 
 YUTIQ, our lead product candidate, is based on our Durasert technology platform and consists of an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert designed to treat chronic NIPU, intermediate uveitis and panuveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. YUTIQ is designed to provide sustained daily release of a total of 0.18 mg of the off-patent corticosteroid FA at a controlled rate directly to the back of the eye over approximately three years from a single administration performed in an office visit. It is injected with our proprietary inserter using a 25-gauge needle. We are developing YUTIQ independently and have licensed regulatory, reimbursement and distribution rights to Alimera for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or the EMEA, under its ILUVIEN tradename. Subject to NDA approval by the FDA, we plan to independently commercialize YUTIQ in the U.S. Further, in conjunction with the commercialization of DEXYCU, we expect to spread our commercial, medical, legal, corporate and regulatory infrastructure over two products. 
 Posterior segment uveitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, often involving the retina, and is a leading cause of blindness in developed countries. It afflicts people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. In the U.S., posterior segment uveitis is estimated to affect approximately 55,000-120,000 people in the U.S., resulting in approximately 30,000 cases of blindness and making it the third leading cause of blindness in the U.S. Patients with posterior segment uveitis are typically treated with ocular injected steroids and systemic steroids, but frequently develop serious side effects from systemic steroids over time that can limit effective dosing. Patients who do not tolerate systemic steroids then are offeredas the last line of treatmenttherapy with systemic immunosuppressants or biologics, which themselves can cause severe side effects. 
YUTIQ Phase 3 Trials 
 In our two Phase 3 trials to assess the safety and efficacy of YUTIQ, we achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of uveitis through six months with statistical significance (p value of < 0.001 in each study). These studies are randomized, sham injection-controlled, double-masked trials with the primary endpoint of both trials defined as recurrence of uveitis at six months, with patients followed for three years. Our first Phase 3 trial enrolled 129 patients in 16 centers in the U.S. and 17 centers outside the U.S, with 87 eyes treated with YUTIQ and 42 eyes receiving sham injections. Our second Phase 3 trial enrolled 153 patients in 15 centers in India with 101 eyes treated with YUTIQ and 52 eyes receiving sham injections. The 36-month patient follow-up was recently completed in the first of the two Phase 3 trials. 
 Our first Phase 3 trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of disease at 6 months with statistical significance (p < 0.001, intent to treat analysis; recurrence of 18.4% for YUTIQ versus 78.6% for control). The trial yielded similar efficacy through 12 months of follow up (p < 0.0001, intent to treat analysis; recurrence of 27.6% for YUTIQ versus 85.7% for control). YUTIQ was generally well tolerated through 12-months of follow-up. The incremental risk of elevated IOP for YUTIQ-treated eyes compared to control eyes was lower through 12 months than through six months for elevation over 21 mmHg (6.1% versus 10.9%) as well as for the more serious elevation over 25 mmHg (7.6% versus 11.3%). Elevated IOP was generally well treated with eye drops. Through 12 months, the percentage of eyes requiring filtration surgery was low and similar between YUTIQ-treated and control eyes (3.4% versus 2.4%). Of the 63 study eyes with a natural lens at baseline, 33.3% of YUTIQ-treated eyes compared to 4.8% of control eyes required cataract surgery through 12 months. Cataracts are both a side effect of treatment with steroids and a natural consequence of uveitis. 
 Our second Phase 3 trial also met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of disease at 6 months with statistical significance (p < 0.001, intent to treat analysis; recurrence of 21.8% for YUTIQ versus 53.8% for control). As in the first Phase 3 trial, YUTIQ was generally well tolerated through 6 months, and 12-month follow-up efficacy and safety data was consistent with the 12-month data from our first Phase 3 trial. The 36-month patient follow-up is expected to be completed in October 2019.

 We also conducted a multi-center, randomized, controlled, single-masked study of the safety and utilization of two different inserters for YUTIQ. We enrolled 26 subjects (38 eyes) in this study in 6 centers in the U.S. The utilization and safety results of this study have been included in our NDA filing for YUTIQ. 
 YUTIQ Regulatory Strategy 
 On March 19, 2018, the FDA accepted our NDA for YUTIQ and set a PDUFA action date of November 5, 2018. If approved, we plan to launch YUTIQ in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019. 
 We have out-licensed the rights for YUTIQ for the treatment of NIPU to Alimera for the EMEA as an extension of our original license agreement with Alimera. Pursuant to the original agreement, we granted worldwide license rights to ILUVIEN for DME and other potential back-of-the-eye diseases (other than uveitis) utilizing a corticosteroid with our Durasert technology. In the European Economic Area, or EEA, Alimera has submitted our previously-filed YUTIQ data as a Type II variation in each of the 17 countries in which it previously obtained regulatory approval for ILUVIEN for DME. According to Alimeras public filings, Alimera plans to submit follow-up data supporting its Type II variation application in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2018 and expects it will obtain approval for its application in the first half of calendar 2019. 
YUTIQ Marketing Strategy 
 Subject to approval by the FDA, we intend to commercialize YUTIQ ourselves in the U.S. We believe that the uveitis market in the U.S. is relatively modest in size, with an estimated patient prevalence for NIPU of approximately 55,000 to 120,000 patients. Consequently, the number of retinal physicians who treat the majority of this patient population is estimated to be fewer than 500. As a result, we believe the commercial footprint and cost to market for YUTIQ will be less than a typical pharmaceutical product launch with a larger physician call population. Members of our leadership team have extensive commercialization experience and we believe that commercializing YUTIQ ourselves in the U.S. will maximize the value of YUTIQ to us. Outside of the U.S., we expanded Alimeras license agreement to include uveitis, including NIPU, in the EMEA. This additional license right was part of the July 10, 2017 amended and restated collaboration agreement with Alimera, or the Amended Alimera Agreement. Alimera has reported that it plans to commercialize the NIPU EMEA indication under its ILUVIEN trademark. We plan to seek out-license partner arrangements in other territories. 
 Development Product: Shorter Duration YUTIQ 
 We are developing a next-generation, shorter-duration treatment for posterior segment uveitis, using the same Durasert technology and drug (FA) as in YUTIQ. This program is designed to offer a shorter delivery period, thus providing physicians with flexibility for multiple dosing intervals. Our market research has indicated a strong preference amongst those physicians surveyed for both a six to nine-month drug delivery product and a three-year drug delivery option. Although we believe many patients would likely opt for a longer-acting treatment option, some doctors may prefer to initially treat their uveitis patients over shorter time periods. 
Development Product: Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Insert for Wet AMD 
 We are investigating the development of an injectable, bioerodible, sustained-release Durasert insert delivering a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, for treatment of wet AMD. AMD, the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65, is most commonly treated with intravitreal injections of biologics that block vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. FDA-approved Lucentis® and Eylea® and off-label use of anti-cancer drug Avastin® are the leading treatments for wet AMD. These biologics must be injected into the eye as frequently as monthly and typically can lose efficacy over time, resulting in vision loss and return of the disease. 
 In cancer therapy, TKIs are taken orally but their toxicity prevents their systemic use to treat AMD. Using our Durasert technology, we plan to develop an implant to deliver a TKI directly to the back of the eye with a total dose that is significantly lower than what is customarily used in a course of cancer therapy. 
 
9 


 Our development goal is to provide sustained treatment of wet AMD for six months with a single injection of a TKI-based product, targeting VEGF while avoiding or reducing the toxic systemic side effects of TKIs and the frequent injections of current wet AMD anti-VEGF biologics. Using a model TKI (that is not patentable), we have generated pre-clinical data that demonstrate that a TKI delivered by a sustained release insert was comparably efficacious to a commercially available biologic indicated for wet AMD delivered by injection, both in preventing choroidal neovascularization and in reducing vascular leakage. On the basis of these data, we are currently evaluating other, potentially patentable TKIs for sustained release over several months and with comparable therapeutic effects. 
 Approved Durasert Technology Product: ILUVIEN for DME 
 ILUVIEN is an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert based on our Durasert technology platform and delivers 0.19 mg of FA to the back of the eye for treatment of DME. The ILUVIEN micro-insert is substantially the same micro-insert as YUTIQ. ILUVIEN is injected in an office visit using a 25-gauge inserter, and delivers approximately 36 months of continuous, low-dose corticosteroid therapy with a single injection. ILUVIEN is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in IOP. In the 17 EU countries where ILUVIEN has been approved, it is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. DME is a disease suffered by diabetics where leaking capillaries cause swelling in the macula, the most sensitive part of the retina. DME is a leading cause of blindness in the working-age population in most developed countries. 
 We originally licensed our Durasert proprietary insert technology to Alimera for use in ILUVIEN for the treatment of all ocular diseases (excluding uveitis). Alimera has sold ILUVIEN for DME in the U.K. and Germany since 2013, in Portugal and the U.S. since 2015 and in Austria and Ireland since 2017. ILUVIEN also has marketing approvals in 12 other European countries. In addition, Alimera has entered into various agreements under which distributors will provide regulatory, reimbursement and/or sales and marketing support for commercialization or future commercialization of ILUVIEN in several countries in the Middle East, as well as in France, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. 
 On July 10, 2017, we entered into the Amended Alimera Agreement, pursuant to which we (i) expanded the license to Alimera to our proprietary Durasert sustained-release drug delivery technology platform to include uveitis, including NIPU, in the EMEA and (ii) converted the net profit share arrangement for each licensed product (including ILUVIEN) under the original collaboration agreement with Alimera, or the Prior Alimera Agreement, to a sales-based royalty on a calendar quarter basis commencing July 1, 2017, with payments from Alimera due 60 days following the end of each calendar quarter. 
 Sales-based royalties start at the rate of 2%. Commencing January 1, 2019 (or earlier under certain circumstances), the sales-based royalty will increase to 6% on aggregate calendar year net sales up to $75 million and 8% in excess of $75 million. Alimeras share of contingently recoverable accumulated ILUVIEN commercialization losses under the Prior Alimera Agreement, capped at $25 million, are to be reduced as follows: (i) $10.0 million was cancelled in lieu of an upfront license fee on the effective date of the Amended Alimera Agreement; (ii) for calendar years 2019 and 2020, 50% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments otherwise due from Alimera; (iii) on January 1, 2020, another $5 million will be cancelled, provided, however, that such date of cancellation may be extended under certain circumstances related to Alimeras regulatory approval process for ILUVIEN for the treatment of NIPU, with such extension, if any, subject to mutual agreement by the parties; and (iv) commencing in calendar year 2021, 20% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments due from Alimera until such time as the balance of the original $25 million of recoverable commercialization losses has been fully recouped. 
 Following the completion of the Amended Alimera Agreement, we withdrew our previously filed EU marketing approval application and our EU orphan drug designation for YUTIQ, and Alimera was responsible

  for filing a Type II variation for ILUVIEN for the treatment of NIPU. In January 2018, Alimera received validation of a Type II variation submitted in December 2017 in all seventeen European countries in which it previously received regulatory approval for ILUVIEN for DME. According to Alimeras public filings, Alimera plans to submit follow-up data supporting its Type II variation application in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2018 and expects it will obtain approval for its application in the first half of calendar 2019. If the variation is approved, Alimera has reported that it plans to commercialize the three-year uveitis indication under its ILUVIEN trademark. 
 Approved Durasert Technology Product: Retisert for Posterior Segment Uveitis 
 Retisert is a sustained-release implant based on our Durasert technology platform for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. Surgically implanted, it delivers 0.59 mg of FA to the back of the eye for approximately 30 months. Retisert is licensed to Bausch & Lomb, with which we co-developed the product. Approved in the U.S., Bausch & Lomb sells the product and pays sales-based royalties to us. 
 Approved Durasert Technology Product: Vitrasert for CMV Retinitis 
 Vitrasert is a sustained-release implant based on our Durasert technology platform for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis, a blinding eye disease that occurs in individuals with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Surgically implanted, Vitrasert provided sustained delivery of the anti-viral drug ganciclovir for six to eight months. Approved in the U.S. and EU, Vitrasert was licensed to Bausch & Lomb, which discontinued sales in fiscal 2013 following patent expiration. 
Development Product: Severe Knee Osteoarthritis Implant 
 We have developed an implant for the treatment of pain associated with severe knee osteoarthritis, or OA, in collaboration with Hospital for Special Surgery pursuant to an Investigatory-Initiated Research Agreement. This implant was evaluated in an investigator-sponsored pilot study of six patients, which has been completed. The implant is composed of a specially manufactured surgical screw containing a Durasert system that delivers dexamethasone directly to the joint on a sustained basis. Dexamethasone is an off-patent corticosteroid that is frequently used for the treatment of OA. Implanted in the non-articulating area of the knee in an outpatient procedure, the implant is designed to provide long-term pain relief and thereby delay the need for knee replacement surgery. This implant represents the first use of our Durasert technology outside of ophthalmology. We believe this design, if successful, could be adapted for severe OA in other large joints. We plan to out-license our rights to this product. 
 Feasibility Study Agreements 
 From time to time we have entered into feasibility study agreements funded by third parties to evaluate our Durasert technology platform for the treatment of ophthalmic and other diseases. We presently are engaged in one such collaboration for a back of the eye disease. We intend to continue to identify other companies with compounds that could be successfully delivered with our Durasert and Verisome technology platforms and, through appropriate agreements, seek to generate non-dilutive operating capital from such agreements. 
 We have received Notices of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, for trademarks DEXYCU, YUTIQ, DELIVERING INNOVATION TO THE EYE and Durasert in the U.S. Retisert® and Vitrasert® are Bausch & Lombs trademarks. ILUVIEN® is Alimeras trademark.

 Fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 mean the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and fiscal 2019 means the twelve months ending June 30, 2019. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to market multiple drugs for use in diseases of the eye. In addition to DEXYCU and YUTIQ, we plan to (i) acquire or in-license ophthalmology approved products or product candidates developed by third parties, (ii) independently develop non-proprietary drugs in combination with our Durasert or Verisome technology platforms and (iii) continue to leverage our Durasert and Verisome technology platforms through collaborations and license agreements, as appropriate. We plan to execute our strategy as follows: 

 | Launch and maximize the commercial potential of DEXYCU for post-operative inflammation. In February 2018, the FDA approved DEXYCU for the treatment of postoperative inflammation following ocular surgery. DEXYCU is the first long-acting intraocular product approved by the FDA for the treatment of postoperative inflammation. We plan to launch DEXYCU in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019 following the successful scale up of commercial infrastructure and supplies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Obtain regulatory approval for, and maximize the commercial potential of, YUTIQ. On March 19, 2018, the FDA accepted our NDA for YUTIQ and set a PDUFA action date of November 5, 2018. Posterior segment uveitis is a high unmet need area with limited treatment options and the third leading cause of blindness in the U.S. If approved, we expect to launch YUTIQ in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Acquire or in-license ophthalmology products or product candidates developed by third parties. We plan to expand our commercial portfolio of treatments for eye disease by evaluating for acquisition and/or in-licensing approved products or product candidates in late stage clinical development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage our Durasert and Verisome technologies. We plan to use our proprietary Durasert and Verisome drug delivery technology platforms to independently develop new drug delivery products that use already-approved drugs to treat ophthalmic and other diseases, while continuing to leverage our technology platforms through collaborations and licenses with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, institutions and other organizations. We believe our technologies can provide sustained, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, resulting in improved therapeutic effectiveness, safer administration and better patient compliance and convenience, with reduced product development risk and cost. We believe that our proven track record of four approved products, all providing sustained release of previously approved drugs, reflects the benefits of this strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Develop Sustained Delivery of Off-Patent Drugs. Many drugs are now, or will soon be, off-patent. It is estimated that over the next several years, patent coverage will end on products with world-wide sales aggregating billions of dollars annually. We are using our technology platforms to evaluate potential product candidates that deliver off-patent and generic drugs, primarily focused on ocular diseases with significant market opportunities, where less frequent dosing through sustained delivery and/or targeted delivery at the treatment site would materially improve the effectiveness, safety or convenience of the original drug. By focusing on delivery of already-approved drugs, particularly those requiring potentially shorter clinical development programs, we believe we may be able to reduce the substantial risks and financial investment required for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue Partnering with Leading Biopharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Companies. We intend to continue to partner with leading biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, institutions and others, where patent protection, development and regulatory costs, expertise and/or other factors make it desirable for us to have a partner. For example, drugs that might be more effectively delivered by our technology platforms or may have extended patent protection could make collaborations with the patent holders attractive. We may also seek to partner the development of product candidates that could materially benefit from sustained delivery but would require expensive clinical trials or are in treatment areas outside of our technical expertise. We may also seek to partner

with companies with drugs coming off patent where our drug delivery technologies could offer an improved product and effectively extend patent protection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic Collaborations 
 We have entered into a number of collaboration/license agreements to develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies. In all of these collaboration agreements, we have retained the right to use and develop the underlying technologies outside of the scope of the exclusive licenses granted. 
Alimera 
 In February 2005, as amended and restated in March 2008, we granted Alimera an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture, develop, market and sell ILUVIEN for the treatment and prevention of human eye diseases other than uveitis pursuant to the Prior Alimera Agreement. We also granted Alimera a worldwide non-exclusive license to manufacture, develop, market and sell certain additional Durasert-based products (1) to deliver a corticosteroid and no other active ingredient by a direct delivery method to the back of the eye solely for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans other than uveitis and (2) to treat DME in humans by delivering a compound by a direct delivery method through an incision no smaller than that required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. The non-exclusive license is limited to those products that, among other things, (i) have a drug core within a polymer layer (with certain limitations regarding chemically bonded combinations of active agents) and (ii) are approved, or designed to be approved, to deliver a corticosteroid and no other active ingredient by a direct delivery to the posterior portion of the eye, or to treat DME by delivering a compound by a direct delivery through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. We are not permitted to use or grant a license to any third party to use, the licensed technologies to make or sell any products that are or would be subject to the non-exclusive license granted to Alimera. 
 In October 2014, Alimera paid us a $25.0 million milestone upon FDA approval of ILUVIEN as provided in in the Prior Alimera Agreement. 
 In July 2017, we entered into the Amended Alimera Agreement to (i) expand the license to Alimera for our proprietary Durasert sustained-release drug delivery technology platform to include uveitis, including NIPU, in the EMEA and (ii) convert the previous net profit share arrangement on a country-by-country basis to sales-based royalties for ILUVIEN for DME, NIPU and any other ILUVIEN indications that obtain regulatory approval in various jurisdictions in the future, provided that certain amounts of Alimeras previous ILUVIEN net commercialization losses can be offset against earned sales-based royalties (as described below). We are entitled to receive a 2% sales-based royalty within 60 days following the end of each quarterly period through calendar year 2018. Commencing January 1, 2019 (or earlier under certain circumstances) the sales-based royalty will increase to 6% on aggregate calendar year net sales up to $75 million and 8% on any calendar year sales in excess of $75 million. Alimeras share of accumulated ILUVIEN commercialization losses under the original net profit share arrangement (as set forth in the Prior Alimera Agreement), is capped at $25 million. Under the Amended Alimera Agreement, these recoverable losses will be reduced as follows: (i) $10 million was cancelled in lieu of any upfront license fee on the effective date of the Amended Alimera Agreement; (ii) for calendar years 2019 and 2020, 50% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% of net sales will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments due from Alimera; (iii) on January 1, 2020 (or earlier under certain circumstances), another $5 million of the accumulated commercialization losses will be cancelled, provided, however, that such date of cancellation may be extended further under certain circumstances related to Alimeras regulatory approval process for ILUVIEN for the treatment of NIPU, with such extension, if any, subject to mutual agreement by the parties; and (iv) commencing in calendar year 2021, 20% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% of net sales will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments due from Alimera until such time as the remaining balance of the original $25 million of commercialization losses has been recouped by Alimera.

 Bausch & Lomb 
 Under a 2003 amended license agreement, Bausch & Lomb has a worldwide exclusive license to make and sell Retisert and other first-generation products defined in the agreement in return for royalties based on sales. This agreement also covered Vitrasert prior to patent expiration. Bausch & Lomb can terminate its agreement with us without penalty at any time upon 90 days written notice. 
Pfizer 
 In June 2011, we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, which we refer to as the Restated Pfizer Agreement, to focus solely on the development of a sustained-release bioerodible micro-insert injected into the subconjunctiva designed to deliver latanoprost for human ophthalmic disease or conditions other than uveitis, or the Latanoprost Product. Pfizer made an upfront payment of $2.3 million and we agreed to provide Pfizer options under various circumstances for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product. On October 25, 2016, we notified Pfizer that we had discontinued development of the Latanoprost Product, which provided Pfizer a 60-day option to acquire a worldwide license in return for a $10.0 million payment and potential sales-based royalties and development, regulatory and sales performance milestone payments. Pfizer did not exercise its option and the Restated Pfizer Agreement automatically terminated on December 26, 2016. Per the terms of the Restated Pfizer Agreement, we retained the right thereafter to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product on our own or with a partner. 
OncoSil Medical Ltd. 
 Our December 2012 license agreement, amended and restated in March 2013, with Enigma Therapeutics Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of OncoSil Medical Ltd, or OncoSil Medical, provides OncoSil Medical with an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for the development of BrachySil (now named OncoSil), a product candidate for the treatment of pancreatic and other cancers. We received an upfront fee of $100,000 and are entitled to an 8% sales-based royalty, 20% of sublicense consideration and milestones based on aggregate product sales. To date, OncoSil Medical has not received regulatory approval for OncoSil in any jurisdiction. OncoSil Medical is obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $100,000, creditable during each ensuing twelve-month period against reimbursable patent maintenance costs and sales-based royalties. Annual license maintenance fees of $100,000 were paid in respect of each calendar year from 2013 through 2017. OncoSil Medical has the right to terminate this license upon 60 days prior written notice. 
Research and Development 
 Our clinical and pre-clinical research programs primarily focus on ophthalmic applications of our technology platforms. Our research and development expenses totaled $16.2 million in fiscal 2018, $14.9 million in fiscal 2017 and $14.4 million in fiscal 2016. Of these amounts, $13.9 million in fiscal 2018, $13.0 million in fiscal 2017 and $12.8 million in fiscal 2016 were incurred for costs of research and development personnel, clinical and pre-clinical studies, contract services, testing and laboratory facilities. The remaining expense of $2.3 million in fiscal 2018, $1.9 million in fiscal 2017 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 consisted of non-cash charges for amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment and stock-based compensation expense specifically allocated to research and development personnel. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we consolidated all of our research and development operations in our facility in Watertown, Massachusetts. We closed our research facility in Malvern, U.K. and terminated the employment of all our employees in that location.

 Intellectual Property 
 We own or license patents in the U.S. and other countries. Our patents generally cover the design, formulation, manufacturing methods and use of our sustained release therapeutics, devices and technologies. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Patent term extension may be available in various countries to compensate for a patent office delay or a regulatory delay in approval of the product. 
 The U.S. patent with which Retisert is marked expires in March 2019. The last expiring patent covering Retisert expires in April 2020. The latest expiring patent covering ILUVIEN and YUTIQ expires in August 2027 in the U.S. and in October 2024 in the EU, although extensions have been obtained or applied for through May 2027 in various EU countries. The last of the previously issued patents covering DEXYCU expire in July 2023, but two additional patents have issued in the U.S. that will cover DEXYCU until at least 2034. 
 The following table provides general details relating to our owned and licensed patents (including both patents that have been issued and applications that have been accepted for issuance) and patent applications as of August 31, 2018:

Employees 
 We had 44 employees as of August 31, 2018. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently plan to use a contract manufacturer for commercial supplies of our DEXYCU approved product. Subject to FDA approval, we plan to source raw materials and components necessary to manufacture YUTIQ through third-party vendors and assemble commercial supplies of finished product ourselves in our Watertown, MA facility. All of our other pre-clinical study and clinical trial supplies for product candidates that utilize our Durasert technology platform have been, and will continue to be, manufactured ourselves. Raw materials and components are available from multiple sources. The manufacture of each of Retisert and ILUVIEN is the responsibility of our licensees. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We currently are building out our U.S. marketing and sales staff. Members of our leadership team have extensive commercialization experience at previous companies. We plan to launch DEXYCU in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019 following the successful scale up of commercial infrastructure and supplies and, if approved by FDA, we expect to also launch YUTIQ in the U.S. in the first half of calendar year 2019. We have invested substantially in our sales and marketing infrastructure since May 2018 and that will continue during the balance of calendar year 2018 in preparation for the aforementioned product launches. We have entered into an agreement with a CSO for the field-based sales representatives and key account managers to promote DEXYCU 
 
15 


  and, if approved by the FDA, YUTIQ, to our defined audiences in the U.S. We plan to out-license DEXYCU for any territories outside the U.S. We have already out-licensed YUTIQ to Alimera for the EMEA and would expect to seek further out-licenses for other territories outside the U.S. and EMEA. 
 Competition 
 The market for products treating eye diseases is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We face substantial competition for our FDA-approved product and our product candidates. Pharmaceutical, drug delivery and biotechnology companies, as well as research organizations, governmental entities, universities, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations and individual scientists, have developed and are seeking to develop drugs, therapies and novel delivery methods to treat diseases targeted by our products and product candidates. Most of our competitors and potential competitors are larger, better established, more experienced and have substantially more resources than we or our partners have. Competitors may reach the market earlier, may have obtained or could obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our products and potential products, and may offer products with greater efficacy, lesser or fewer side effects and/or other competitive advantages. We believe that competition for treatments of back-of-the-eye diseases is based upon the effectiveness of the treatment, side effects, time to market, reimbursement and price, reliability, ease of administration, dosing or injection frequency, patent position and other factors. 
 Many companies have or are pursuing products to treat eye diseases that are or would be competitive with DEXYCU, ILUVIEN for DME or, if approved, YUTIQ and ILUVIEN for NIPU. Some of these products and potential products include the following: 
 

 | Inflammation following cataract surgery. There is a high unmet medical need among patients who undergo cataract surgery as the current standard of care to treat the inflammation post-surgery includes a schedule of up to 70 eye drops over a period of 3- 4 weeks. In August 2018, Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the FDA approved INVELTYS (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 1% for the topical treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. INVELTYS is the first twice-daily ocular corticosteroid approved for this indication while all other available ocular steroid eyedrops are only approved for four-times-a-day dosing. This product is expected to improve compliance and allow for less burdensome self-dosing with eyedrops for patients. Ocular Therapeutix Inc. is developing DEXTENZA®, which is a corticosteroid intracanalicular insert placed through the punctum, a natural opening in the eye lid, into the canaliculus, and is designed to deliver dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days. Following treatment, DEXTENZA is intended to resorb and exit the nasolacrimal system without the need for removal. DEXTENZA has completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. and is currently limited by U.S. law to investigational use only because the product has not been approved by the FDA. On June 29, 2018, Ocular Therapeutix re-filed its NDA with the FDA, which approved its re-submission and set a PDUFA action date of December 28, 2018. Both INVELTYS and DEXTENZA deliver a steroid on the surface of the eye and therefore are dependent on penetration through the cornea to reach the intended target of the anti-inflammatory effect. On the other hand, since DEXYCU is delivered directly into the posterior chamber and bypasses that anatomical barrier, we believe that it can exert its anti-inflammatory effect upon dosing.

 | DME. Genentech USA Inc.s LUCENTIS® (ranibizumab) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals EYLEA® (aflibercept) are approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of DME. Roches lower-cost AVASTIN® is approved to treat various cancers, but is used off-label for treatment of diabetic retinopathy. These products are VEGF inhibitors which are considered first line therapy for DME due to their ability to block the VEGF protein, which at high levels can cause abnormal blood vessels to grow in the eye and leak fluid. Genentech is a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group. Novartis AG, or Novartis, has the right to market and sell LUCENTIS outside of the U.S. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA in the U.S., and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC owns the

exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S. LUCENTIS, EYLEA and AVASTIN are all injected into the back of the eye on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Allergan, Inc.s, or Allergan, OZURDEX® (dexamethasone intravitreal implant), a bioerodible intravitreal implant, has been approved for the treatment of DME, retinal vein occlusion and posterior segment uveitis, and has a therapeutic duration of several months. As with ILUVIEN, OZURDEX delivers a corticosteroid (dexamethasone) to the back of the eye through an intravitreal injection. However, it only lasts for up to several months, resulting in frequent injections compared to ILUVIEN lasting for up to three years. Other companies, including Roche, are working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery systems for the potential treatment of DME. RG7716, being developed by Roche, is a bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds to and inactivates vascular endothelial growth factor A, or VEGF-A, and angiopoietin-2. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, RG7716 demonstrated clinically meaningful visual acuity gains from baseline, and statistically significant improvements in visual acuity compared with ranibizumab. Roches Phase 3 clinical trial of RG7716 in DME is expected to begin later in calendar year 2018.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Posterior Segment Uveitis. Periocular steroid injections and systemic delivery of corticosteroids are routinely used to treat posterior segment uveitis, which is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the eye. It is treated both aggressively and frequently by physicians in order to minimize the disease flares, which are the main cause of vision deterioration and potential blindness. OZURDEX, which is marketed by Allergan, is approved in the U.S. and EU for posterior segment uveitis through an intravitreal bioerodible implant that provides treatment which lasts for several months. As with DME, the several-month effectiveness of OZURDEX can result in frequent intravitreal injections of the implant. AbbVie, Inc. recently obtained FDA approval for HUMIRA® (adalimumab) for the treatment of all types of non-infectious uveitis (intermediate, posterior and panuveitis) and it is administered subcutaneously every other week for systemic delivery. HUMIRA is a biologic that blocks tumor necrosis factor alpha, a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Humiras retail price in the U.S. is approximately $50,000 per year. Other companies have ongoing trials of posterior segment uveitis treatments, including Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., which recently received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA for their filed NDA for sirolimus, which is administered through intravitreal injection every two months. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and modulator of the immune system, and is being developed for NIPU. Clearsides CLS-TA (triamcinolone acetonide, a steroid) for macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis is in Phase 3 trials and it is administered through a suprachoroidal injection administered every 12 weeks. Preliminary clinical data indicated that the suprachoroidal route may reduce the risk of increased IOP that is typically associated with intraocular injection of steroids. The results of the Phase 3 trial, presented in September 2018, indicated that while about 50% of patients experienced significant improvements in visual acuity through 24 weeks, adverse events of IOP increase were reported in about 12% of patients.

 | Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Wet AMD, the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65, is most commonly treated with intravitreal injections of biologics that block VEGF. FDA-approved Lucentis and EYLEA and off-label use of the anti-cancer Avastin® are the leading treatments for wet AMD. These biologics must be injected into the eye frequently and typically can lose efficacy over time, resulting in vision loss and return of the disease. However, EYLEA was recently approved by the FDA for dosing every 12 weeks. Novartis is currently developing an antibody fragment, brolucizumab, with high affinity to all VEGF-A isoforms. In May 2018, Novartis announced that treatment with brolucizumab, which could be given every 12 weeks, showed non-inferior improvements in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) when compared with EYLEA every 8 weeks in two Phase 3 trials. Novartis plans to apply for approval with the FDA by the end of calendar year 2018. Abicipar pegol is a monoDARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) that blocks all isoforms of VEGF-A and is currently being developed by Allergan. Smaller molecular size (34 kDa) may lead to longer duration (12 weeks) than the currently available anti-VEGF-A agents. Allergan is conducting Phase 3 trials to compare treatment arms of abicipar every 8 weeks, abicipar every 12 weeks and ranibizumab every

four weeks. In July 2018, Allergan announced the release of two positive clinical trials, SEQUOIA and CEDAR for abicipar, demonstrating that both the 8-week and 12-week treatment regimens met the pre-specified primary endpoint of non-inferiority to ranibizumab. The port delivery system with ranibizumab, or PDS, is a refillable reservoir system being developed by Genentech and it is designed to gradually release Lucentis (ranibizumab). The drug is released using a diffusion-control mechanism and the port is placed under the conjunctiva, fixed to the pars plana, and no sutures are needed. The port is then refilled as an in-office procedure with the help of a refill needle system that simultaneously introduces the drug into the reservoir and removes any remaining contents. In July 2018, Roche announced positive Phase 2 results: the majority of PDS patients went 6 months or longer between the implant of the device and first required refill, and patients in the high dose PDS group achieved similar vision outcomes as monthly ranibizumab eye injections. Phase 3 clinical trials are expected to begin later in calendar year 2018 to evaluate PDS in wet AMD. In cancer therapy, TKIs are taken orally, but their toxicity prevents their systemic use to treat AMD. Graybug Vision, Inc.s, or Graybug Vision, lead product, GB-102, is an intravitreal injectable depot formulation of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib malate, that blocks multiple angiogenesis pathways. In 2017, Graybug Vision launched the first clinical trial of GB-102 given every 6 months in patients with wet AMD. This Phase 1/2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate patients being treated with available intravitreal anti-VEGF agents who are later switched over to just GB-102.

Government Regulation 
 We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, and FDAs implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the U.S., we currently out-license certain of our products and may seek approval for, and market, other products in other countries in the future. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the European Commission but country specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.

 Development and Approval 
 Under the FD&C Act, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant. 
 Pre-clinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human patients in the U.S., a company must generate extensive pre-clinical data. Pre-clinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agricultures Animal Welfare Act. 
 IND Application. Human clinical trials in the U.S. cannot commence until an investigational new drug, or IND, application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit pre-clinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop a clinical trial by placing it on clinical hold because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDAs bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events, or AEs. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data. 
 A study sponsor is required to publicly post specified details about certain clinical trials and clinical trial results on government or independent websites (e.g., http://clinicaltrials.gov). Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another: 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human patients, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population and are designed to develop initial data regarding the products effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential AEs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drugs overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target

disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. 
 NDA Submission and Review. The FD&C Act provides two pathways for the approval of new drugs through an NDA. An NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure its identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA contains results of the full set of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate. 
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval for new formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDAs findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug, or RLD, and submit its own product-specific datawhich may include data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicantto address differences between the product candidate and the RLD. 
 The submission of an NDA under either Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality, and purity. For some NDAs, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to seek insights and recommendations on issues relevant to approval of the application. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations. 
 The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain applications for approval must also include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
 Once the FDA accepts an NDA submission for filingwhich occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDAthe FDAs goal for a non-priority review of an NDA is ten months. The review process can be and often is significantly extended, however, by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. After review of an NDA, the FDA may decide to not approve the application or may issue a complete response letter, or CRL, outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The CRL also may request additional information, including additional pre-clinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. 
 
20 


 Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as Phase 4 or post-marketing studies. 
 Post-approval modifications to the drug, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials if there are new safety information developments. 
 Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements. 
 Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, advertising and promotion to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for off-label usesthat is, uses not approved by the FDA and not described in the products labelingbecause the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced, scientific communication regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug. 
 
21 


 Other Requirements. NDA holders must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act 
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products. 
 Generic Drugs. A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed products safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. 
 505(b)(2) NDAs. As discussed above, if a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Unlike an ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed products safety and effectiveness. Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on the FDAs finding that the RLD is safe and effective, and must submit its own product-specific data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products. An NDA approved under 505(b)(2) may in turn serve as an RLD for subsequent applications from other sponsors. 
 RLD Patents. In an NDA, a sponsor must identify patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent. A Paragraph III certification is the sponsors statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A Paragraph IV certification is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product. 
 Regulatory Exclusivities. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a new chemical entity, or NCEgenerally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drugthere is a period of five years from the products approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a Paragraph IV certification. 
 A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains new clinical data, derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. 
 Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application 
 
22 


  has been submitted and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicants assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. 
 Patent Term Restoration. A portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration. 
 European and Other International Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, similar to the FDA a CTA must be submitted for authorization to the competent national authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee, much like the IRB, has issued a favorable opinion. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the related national implementing provisions of the relevant individual EU Member States requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, or Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted. The Regulation is anticipated to enter into force in 2020. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point, the EU portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. 
 To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the competent regulatory authority. In the EU, marketing 
 
23 


  authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or the national procedure of an individual EU Member State. A marketing authorization, irrespective of its route to authorization, may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days. This period excludes clock stops during which additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions posed by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. A major public health interest defined by three cumulative criteria: (i) the seriousness of the disease (for example, heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated, (ii) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and (iii) anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. If the CHMP accepts to review a medicinal product as a major public health interest, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days. It is, however, possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 Irrespective of the related procedure, at the completion of the review period the CHMP will provide a scientific opinion concerning whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. This opinion is based on a review of the quality, safety, and efficacy of the product. Within 15 days of the adoption, the EMA will forward its opinion to the European Commission for its decision. Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This route is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are of significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 Marketing authorization holders are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of marketing authorization. This includes control of compliance by the entities with EU cGMP rules, which govern quality control of the manufacturing process and require documentation policies and procedures. 
 
24 


 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Compliance 
 During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Third country authorities can impose equivalent penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Other Exclusivities 
 Pediatric Exclusivity. Section 505A of the FD&C Act provides for six months of additional exclusivity or patent protection if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data does not need to show that the product is effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDAs request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any product is approved, we will evaluate seeking pediatric exclusivity as appropriate. 
 In the EU, Regulation No 1901/2006, or the Pediatric Regulation, requires that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an European Medicines Agency, or EMA, approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP. This PIP covers all subsets in a pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted either, a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. Where all measures provided in the agreed PIP are completed a six months extension period of qualifying Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, is granted. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication generally is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. 
 In the EU, medicinal products: (a) that are used to diagnose, treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU; or (b) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation in the EU. The application for orphan 
 
25 


  designation must be submitted to the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products and approved by the European Commission before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal product designation entitles an applicant to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. In addition, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity following authorization. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity 
 Data Exclusivity. In the EU, if a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities. The product also benefits from 10 years market exclusivity during which generic products, even if authorized, may not be placed on the market. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the donut hole), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Services 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. 
 Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval, business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the Affordable Care Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act. 
 Moreover, legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. 
 
26 


  government signed into law comprehensive tax legislation, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or replaced in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payors, such as commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover and the amount of reimbursement they will provide for a covered drug. In the U.S., there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products, if approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costly studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct pharmacoeconomic studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by payors. Further, a payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. 
 In the past, payors have implemented reimbursement metrics and periodically revised those metrics as well as the methodologies used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, or ASP, average manufacturer price, or AMP, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. The CMS surveys and publishes retail pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. 
 We intend to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. This program would require us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the basic portion of the rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price available from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer, or Best Price. AMP must be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis only. In addition, the rebate also includes the additional portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an inflation penalty when the drugs latest quarters AMP exceeds the drugs AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index-Urban. The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for our drug. The terms of our participation in the program would impose a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision.

 Federal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Services 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturers drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B ceiling price for the manufacturers covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations. 
 In the U.S. Medicare program, outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C. 
 Coverage and reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs under Part D are not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Although Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques. 
 The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and other cost reduction initiatives in the program, could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. 
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we expect to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we would be obligated to make our innovator drugs available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agenciesthe VA, U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guardthat is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also expect to participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we would pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. 
 Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. For more information about Medicare Part B, refer to the risk factor entitled Even if we are 
 
28 


  able to commercialize our products, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business set forth under the section titled Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government or fails to submit the required price data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the manufacturers Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for the manufacturers covered outpatient drugs. In addition, claims submitted to federally-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for drugs priced based on incorrect pricing data provided by a manufacturer can implicate the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2027. If Congress does not take action in the future to modify these sequestrations, Medicare Part D plans could seek to reduce their negotiated prices for drugs. Other legislative or regulatory cost containment legislation could have a similar effect. 
 Further, the Affordable Care Act may reduce the profitability of drug products. It expanded manufacturers rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. 
 The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $4.1 billion in 2018, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Services 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. It appears likely that the Affordable Care Act will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 Legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration, as discussed above under the heading U.S. Healthcare Reform. In addition, there likely will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. Thus, even if we obtain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for any products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, each EU Member State can restrict the range of medicinal products for which its national health insurance system provides reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use marketed on its territory. As a result, following receipt of marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with the competent pricing authority in the individual EU Member State. The governments of the EU Member States influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some EU Member States operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Further, some EU Member States approve a specific price for the medicinal product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, we may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products, however, is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include the U.K., France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. 
 The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU Member States. 
 In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our business is subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These laws include, but are not limited to the following: 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for 
 
30 


  purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. The Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceuticals, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, speakers or advisors, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and do not fit within an exception or safe harbor are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, based on the facts and circumstances, they violate the statute. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by private individuals known as qui tam relators in the name of the government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the False Claims Act for, among other things, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, inflating prices reported to private price publication services which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs, and other interactions with prescribers and other customers including interactions that may have affected customers billing or coding practices on claims submitted to the federal government. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companys marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. Other states have laws requiring pharmaceutical sales representatives to be registered or licensed, and still others impose limits on co-pay assistance that pharmaceutical companies can offer to patients. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.

 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the previous calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Compliance with such laws and regulations will require substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity. 
 Healthcare Privacy Laws 
 We may be subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity.
