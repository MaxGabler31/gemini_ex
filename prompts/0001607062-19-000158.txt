Our Business Plan
 We plan to open and manage upscale restaurants and catering facilities, initially in the Peoples’ Republic of China (“PRC”), if we are successful, we may expand our services in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia. We may also license our brand names to other experienced operators and/or chefs of upscale restaurants.
 On April 3, 2018, DB-Link entered into a cooperation agreement with Alvin Leung, as co-founder, regarding brand cooperation and the catering business in the territory of the Mainland China, Australia, New Zealand and the United States (the “initial territory”). The agreement provides that Mr. Leung will exclusively work with DB-Link in the initial territory and will provide DB-Link with the brand names of “Bo” and “Daimon” in the initial territory, and he granted DB-Link the right of first cooperation before seeking similar cooperation with other parties in Canada, Hong Kong and Europe. DB-Link’s business will be operated by joint venture entities in which DB-Link will hold a 66% equity interest and Mr. Leung a 34% interest. In addition, DB-Link will pay Mr. Leung RMB 800,000 (approximately $127,000), half was paid with the balance payable in 2019.
 We believe that our cooperation agreement with Alvin Leung will enable us to develop and operate upscale restaurants based on the methods that Mr. Leung developed for his well-known restaurants in Hong Kong, which received three Michelin stars, and London, which received one Michelin star. However, each restaurant is different, and Mr. Leung will not have the personal involvement in our restaurants that he has with his own. It will be very difficult to duplicate the success that a restaurant has in one market to another market with a different operation, including a different chef and a different affecting factors. Unlike fast food and popular restaurant chains, each upscale restaurant has its own personality and its own distinct style and ambiance.
 Unlike restaurant chains, we do not anticipate that our restaurants will be identical in each location, and the chef will be the key to the success of each restaurant. We also believe that the location of our restaurants will be critical to our long-term success. In selecting a location, we intend to focus on major metropolitan areas in China with demographic and discretionary spending profiles that favor our high-end concepts. To the extent that we bring in partners, in addition to Mr. Leung, or work with a licensee, we will look at the potential partner’s or licensee’s track record and management experience. In choosing a location, we consider factors such as traffic patterns, proximity to high-end shopping areas and office buildings, hotels and convention centers, area restaurant competition, accessibility and visibility. Our ability to open new restaurants depends upon, among other things, finding quality locations, reaching acceptable agreements regarding the lease of locations, raising or having available adequate capital for construction and opening costs, timely hiring, training and retaining the skilled management, particularly the chef, and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs, obtaining, for an acceptable cost, required permits and approvals and efficiently managing the amount of time and expense to build out and open each new restaurant.
 Source of Supply
 We intend to seek consistent quality of the food and beverages served in our properties. Since most of the food ingredients will be sourced locally, each restaurant, or, if there is more than one in a metropolitan area, we plan to appoint one purchasing manager for the area. We will seek to maintain consistent company-wide quality in our restaurants although the menus will vary from restaurant to restaurant, based on the chefs. We do not presently have any relations with any suppliers, and it will be necessary for us to develop such relations as we open restaurants. To the extent the restaurant is operated by a licensee, the licensee will be responsible for developing supply channels, subject to our overall quality control procedures.
Competition
 Competition in the upscale restaurant business is intense, and many restaurants are not successful. The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. Because we market to high-end clientele, low price is not likely to be as crucial a factor as the menu, the quality of the food and service and the restaurant’s ambience and location. We will compete with a substantial number of national and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants for customers, restaurant locations and qualified management, including chefs, and other restaurant staff, including medium and lower price restaurants, since our target customer base does not limit itself to upscale restaurant. To the extent that our restaurants are located in hotels, casinos, resorts and similar locations, we are subject to competition in the broader lodging and hospitality markets that could draw potential customers away from our locations.

Since we are a start-up in the restaurant industry, many, if not most, our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or where we may open restaurants. Our inability to compete successfully with other restaurants and food and beverage hospitality services operations may harm our ability to maintain acceptable levels of revenue growth, limit or otherwise inhibit our ability to grow one or more of our concepts, or force us to close one or more of our restaurants. We may also need to evolve our concepts to compete with popular new upscale restaurant or concepts or trends that emerge, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that any changes we make to any of our concepts in response will be successful or not adversely affect our profitability. In addition, with improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants combined with the effects of negative economic conditions and other factors, consumers may choose less expensive alternatives, which could also negatively affect customer traffic at our restaurants or food and beverage hospitality services operations. Any unanticipated slowdown in demand at any of our restaurants due to industry competition may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 Seasonality
 To the extent that our restaurants are in locations that have adverse weather in summer or winter, our business may be affected by weather conditions.
 Intellectual Property 
 Pursuant to the cooperation agreement with Alvin Leung, we have the right to use the names “Bo” and “Daimon” in our restaurants in the initial territory.
Government Regulation
 We are subject to China’s National Environmental Protection Law, as well as a number of other national and local laws and regulations regulating concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. The environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and liabilities for remediation. We are subject to China’s National and State Food Hygiene Law, Food Safety Law, Food Safety Law Implementation Regulations and Food Safety Supervision and Administration Measures for Catering Services. We are also subject to China’s Law on Quality and Safety of Agricultural Products, and Product Quality Law. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in monetary penalties and could result in the temporary or permanent closing of one or more restaurants.
 If we open restaurants in the United States extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations related to the preparation and sale of food, the sale of alcoholic beverages, the sale and use of tobacco, zoning and building codes, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety matters. For example, the preparation, storing and serving of food and the use of certain ingredients is subject to heavy regulation. Alcoholic beverage control regulations would govern various aspects of our locations’ daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. If we operate in different states, we are also required to comply with a number of different laws covering the same topics. The failure of any of our locations to timely obtain and maintain necessary governmental approvals, including liquor or other licenses, permits or approvals required to serve alcoholic beverages or food could delay or prevent the opening of a new location or prevent regular day-to-day operations, including the sale of alcoholic beverages, at a location that is already operating, any of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

In addition, the costs of operating our locations may increase if there are changes in laws governing minimum hourly wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits, health care, workers’ compensation insurance rates, unemployment tax rates, sales taxes or other laws and regulations such as those governing access for the disabled, including the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements and imposes new taxes on health insurers and health care benefits that could increase the costs of providing health benefits to employees. In addition, if we have a significant number of locations in certain states, regulatory changes in these states could have a disproportionate impact on our business. If any of the foregoing increased costs were to occur and we were unable to offset the change by increasing our menu prices or by other means, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Government regulation can also affect customer traffic at our locations. A number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information. These regulations would apply if we have 20 or more locations operating under the same trade name and offering substantially the same menus. If we are subject to these laws, we would be required to post nutritional information on their menus to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information. The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is also permitted to require additional nutrient disclosures, such as trans-fat content. Although we do not presently anticipate that we will be subject to these requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to these requirements in the future or that the laws will not change so that they apply to our restaurants in the United States. Our compliance with the PPACA or other similar laws to which we may become subject could reduce demand for our menu offerings, reduce customer traffic and/or reduce average revenue per customer, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. Also, further government regulation restricting smoking in restaurants and bars, may reduce customer traffic. Any reduction in customer traffic related to these or other government regulations could affect revenues and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such hazardous or toxic substances at, on or from our locations. Environmental conditions relating to releases of hazardous substances at prior, existing or future locations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, environmental laws, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 To the extent that governmental regulations impose new or additional obligations on our suppliers, including, without limitation, regulations relating to the inspection or preparation of meat, food and other products used in our business, product availability could be limited and the prices that our suppliers charge us could increase. We may not be able to offset these costs through increased menu prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of our restaurants were unable to serve particular food products, even for a short period of time, or if we are unable to offset increased costs, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Further, the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider and may implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Even if we operate our restaurants in strict compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and state requirements, some of our employees may not meet federal work eligibility or residency requirements, which could lead to a disruption in our work force. Although we intend to require all of our new employees in the U.S. to provide us with the government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to seizure and deportation and may subject us to fines, penalties or loss of our business license in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, a government audit could result in a disruption to our workforce or adverse publicity that could negatively impact our brand and/or potential for receipt of letters from the Social Security Administration requesting information (commonly referred to as no-match letters) could make it more difficult to recruit and/or retain qualified employees.
