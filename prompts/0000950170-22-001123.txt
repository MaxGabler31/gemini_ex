Overview
 JFrog’s vision is to power a world of continuously updated, version-less software – we call this Liquid Software.
 We provide an end-to-end, hybrid, universal DevOps Platform that powers the software supply chain, enabling organizations to continuously deliver software updates across any system. This platform is the critical bridge between software development and deployment of that software, paving the way for the modern DevOps paradigm. We enable organizations to build and release software faster and more securely while empowering developers to be more efficient. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 6,650 organizations have adopted JFrog’s platform, embarking on their journey towards Liquid Software.
 Digital transformation has become an imperative for all organizations, and as such, organizations of all types and sizes are increasingly dependent upon software to better engage with their customers, partners, and employees. As a result, the continuous and reliable release of new software has become mission critical. An organization’s failure to keep software current or react to problems with timely software updates can not only cost lost revenue and reputation, but also threaten human safety and lives. The increased pace and volume of new software and updates have made releasing software in monolithic, discrete versions (e.g., v1.0, v2.0, v3.0) too slow to adequately address dynamic customer demands. We believe the end state of digital transformation is a non-stop, always-on, secure, continuous delivery of value to users, enabled by a world of version-less software.
 DevOps enables the software innovation that is driving digital transformation. The need for organizations to better serve their customers, partners, and employees through software is driving the demand for constant innovation of the software build and release workflow. As the pace and variety of software creation have increased, the domains of software “developers” and IT “operators” have converged. Since our inception, we have embraced the culture and methodologies of modern software development and delivered a platform that connects developers and operators, thus providing the foundation for DevOps. DevOps has since become the approach modern digital organizations take to software development and operations, shortening, automating, and improving the software build and release workflow.
 While many software development technologies today address aspects of a particular segment of DevOps, JFrog provides the common ground for software developers and IT operators, making it integral to the DevOps workflow. Software as it is written by a developer, in source code, cannot be deployed in a runtime environment. In order for software to run in production, source code is transformed into executable binary files that can be understood by and run on a server or device. Organizations need tools that can turn source code into binary files, store, manage, and secure these binaries, and then create software packages, or combinations of one or more binary files, that can be released and deployed to runtime environments. Our platform is designed to manage and deploy all types of software packages within an organization, making it the system of record for an organization’s software, and is often called the “database of DevOps.”
 We had $421.1 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. We generated revenue of $206.7 million and $150.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing a growth rate of 37%. Our net loss was $64.2 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generated operating cash flow of $27.9 million and $29.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our free cash flow was $23.7 million and $25.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Software and the Business Environment
The volume and importance of software is exploding. Organizations in all industries and of all sizes have turned to software to facilitate interactions with their customers, manage day-to-day operations, gain actionable business insights, secure their digital environments, and drive digital transformation. As a result, software’s role has changed from a functional tool to a cornerstone of our daily lives, and from a simple means of driving insight and efficiency to a significant source of competitive advantage.
 The continuous and reliable release of new software is therefore mission critical, where delay or failure can be disruptive to our daily lives and costly to business. If drivers and riders are not running the same version of a ride-hailing company’s software and fail to connect, even for the briefest of moments, those riders can easily turn to a competitor. If an out-of-date piece of a financial institution’s software stack allows a security breach, the organization can suffer enormous reputational harm and be liable for damages. If an airplane’s software is not current, passengers’ lives may be put in danger.


In order to address growing customer expectations, organizations have dramatically reduced the time between releasing new features and functions and resolving security vulnerabilities, from years to months or even days. Updating a feature of a software application, rather than releasing a new version of the entire application, ensures that current software is brought to market faster, allowing organizations to be more responsive to their customers’ needs, and makes software updates less disruptive to the user experience. To keep software current in today’s environment, software updates need to be released incrementally, and with increased frequency.
 The proliferation of open source software, availability of newer and more efficient software development technologies, and the increasing interconnectedness of software enable organizations to produce software at an increasing rate. Meanwhile, the adoption of new architectures, platforms, and technologies, such as microservices, containers, and hybrid and multi-cloud environments, creates significant complications in managing the software release cycle. Organizations’ existing approaches to their software release cycles address each step of the cycle separately, creating silos and bottlenecks around critical steps, such as building, testing, securing, and delivering software. The combination of these new technologies and legacy approaches has placed significant strain on the traditional software build and release workflow.
 The DevOps Workflow
 DevOps enables the software innovation that is driving digital transformation. As the domains of software developers and IT operators have converged. DevOps has emerged as a discipline that integrates software development and operations, shortening, automating, and improving the software build and release workflow. DevOps is a combination of new technologies, methodologies, and culture that powers a continuous, fast, and secure software release cycle.
 The DevOps workflow spans the lifecycle of software, from the planning, coding, building, and testing of software by developers, to the releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring of that software by operators. DevOps increasingly includes the process of managing security earlier in the software release cycle, known as DevSecOps, which helps to remove silos and bottlenecks. While many software development technologies today address aspects of a particular segment of DevOps, JFrog provides the common ground for software developers and IT operators, making it integral to the DevOps workflow.
 The Importance of Software Packages
 Organizations’ need for a continuous, fast, and secure software release cycle has particularly elevated the importance of the core DevOps workflow: building, testing, releasing, and deploying software. This bridge, spanning from the development side to the operations side, is mission critical, yet exceedingly difficult to build and manage at the scale and speed that organizations require.
 Software as it is written by a developer, in source code, cannot be deployed in a runtime environment. In order for software to run in production, source code is transformed into executable binary files that can be understood by and run on a server or device. Organizations need tools that can turn source code into binary files, store, manage and secure these binaries, and then create software packages, or combinations of one or more binary files, that can be released and deployed to runtime environments. Our platform is designed to manage and deploy all types of software packages within an organization, making it the system of record for an organization’s software.
 In today’s business environment, the volume and variety of software packages that need to be managed and stored by organizations is rapidly growing. Software packages are increasingly created by both humans and machines as software build and release workflows are automated, and can also be imported from external sources, such as open source libraries and repositories. The increasingly large volumes and complexity of packages within organizations’ software development ecosystems require a new, systematic, and automated approach to the management of packages. Code repositories, which store and manage source code, are helpful and important developer tools, but cannot efficiently take software that was written by developers and deploy it in runtime environments because they are not purpose-built to manage and cache binary files. Tracking and managing software at the package level enables organizations to make incremental updates to software, eliminating the need for software versions. Package management allows software release management to be continuous, and capable of handling the volume, variety, and velocity of software required today.
 Our Platform
 We built the world’s first universal software package repository, JFrog Artifactory, to fundamentally transform the way that the software release cycle is managed. Our package-based approach to releasing software allows software releases to be continuous and software to always be current.


We enable organizations to securely store all package types in a common repository where they can be edited, tracked, and managed. Our unified platform connects all of the software release processes involved in building and releasing software, enabling continuous releases. We empower our customers to shorten their software release cycles and enable the continuous flow of current, up-to-date software from any source to any destination. Our platform is designed to be agnostic to the programming languages, source code repositories, and development technologies that our customers use, and the type of production environments to which they deploy.
 Our fully integrated suite of products allows our customers to compile software from source code repositories, manage the dependencies among components within software packages, move these packages to a universal repository, ingest packages from third parties, including open source libraries, scan for vulnerabilities through various stages, distribute to endpoints, and deploy in production, all through a single user access point. This complete process is often referred to as management of the “software supply chain.”
 Since our initial launch of JFrog Artifactory, we have consistently innovated and added new products to expand the capabilities of our platform. Today, our platform comprises the full workflow for releasing software.
 
Products

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies, features, and integrations of our platform, as well as the continued improvement and iteration of our existing products. Our most significant investments in research and development are to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. Research and development employees are located primarily in our Israel and India offices.
 Our research and development team consists of our architects, software engineers, security experts, DevOps engineers, product management, quality assurance, and data collection teams. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform and products.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements, license agreements, invention assignment agreements, trademarks, and patents to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand.
 As of December 31, 2021, we hold 8 U.S. patents and had 20 pending U.S. patent applications, including 2 provisional U.S. patents applications, and 6 pending international patent applications. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any of our patents issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
 We control access to, and use of, our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties

to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
 Government Regulations
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations. For example, we are subject to numerous laws, directives, and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other data. In addition, in some cases, our software is subject to export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to certain trade and economic sanctions. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business in Israel, the United States and internationally could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of approximately 1,000 employees operating across nine countries, including approximately 500 employees located in Israel and approximately 300 employees located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or, except for our employees in France and Spain, covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 Our culture
 Our core values are reflected in our codex, which was created by our employees. We believe the codex will support our growth and success moving forward.
 •Integrity. We subscribe to presenting the truth, honestly, even if it’s subjective, in order to achieve mutual well-being and transparency. We might make mistakes, but we always play fair.
 •Community and Customer Happiness. As pain solvers focused on the solution and not on the problem, we invest time and effort to build and develop strategic, long-term relationships to ensure happiness among our community and customers.
 •Thinking BIG. We encourage our employees to stretch their capabilities, knowing that while we think outside the box, every detail counts.
 •Everyone Counts Everyone Matters. Each and every employee has a significant and driving impact on the success of JFrog. Everyone has a voice and everyone’s thoughts and ideas matter.
 •Innovation. We strive for technological excellence and innovation, stepping outside our comfort zone to achieve more and support market needs.
 •Team Spirit. We foster an atmosphere of genuine teamwork and believe in the importance of mutual trust, joint effort, and collaboration to ensure our collective success.
 •Open Communication. Employees are free to approach each other for assistance regardless of rank or affiliation.
 •Agility. We believe change is an opportunity; an agile mindset leads us to better results in a rapidly changing environment.
 •WIN! We believe that with a “Good Enough” mindset, we can never achieve greatness.
 •Care. We care more; it’s the source of our “better-ness.”


Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. In order to meet our human capital resources objectives we have implemented several cross company training programs, including but not limited to training for new managers and training new employees providing them skills to embark on a successful career development path at JFrog. Moreover, we focus on providing each employee a clear career path and professional development opportunities.
  Diversity, Inclusion and Equity
  We recognize and view equity as key to our success. We strive to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion so that all of our employees feel they are respected and treated equally, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural background or religious belief. We strive to emphasize this equality as part of our core values to provide our employees a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment.
Compensation and benefits
 In addition to competitive base salaries and cash compensation, the principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Workforce health and safety
 In addition to traditional employee benefits, we have implemented a number of initiatives to support the well-being, safety and health of our employees. For example, we provide wellness and fitness membership reimbursement programs and ergonomic office equipment. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021, our employees’ health and safety remained our priority. To support remote working, we provided work-from-home stipends to build out home offices. When employees returned to offices to the extent permitted by local government restrictions, we implemented a flexible Back to Office Policy that outlines new safety and health protocols to ensure the safety of our workplaces.
