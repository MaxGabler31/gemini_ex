Organization within the Last Five Years
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 26, 2016. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. Our business office is located at Kiranthidiya road 114, Beruwala, Sri Lanka, 12070. Our telephone number is +17027510467. In General
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 26, 2016. We just recently started our operations. Our business is the production of paper made from elephant dung (poo) for making different stationery products and distribution thereof primarily in Sri Lanka. We have generated limited revenues since inception and our principal business activities to date also consist of creating a business plan, purchasing a domain-name for our prospective webpage. We are not a shell company within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we do have hard assets and real business operations. The total estimated minimum amount of funds required to develop our business is approximately $20,000. We need funds for offering costs, general administrative expenses, production equipment purchase, business development, marketing costs, support materials and costs associated with being a publicly reporting company. We have generated limited revenues from operations to date.     We will disperse our items in Sri Lanka and neighboring countries. We plan to use various distribution channels for various types of customers. As a rule we arranged for a wholesale exchange, however in future we can make some items for various traveler shops and kiosks; corporate customers and individual customers will be covered by our web page and targeted marketing exercises. Product Overview
 Geant Corp.s business is in making unique products to be sold to both mass-market customers and individual clients in future.  We want to focus on something that is socially and environmentally responsible so we are contributing to the solution and not adding to the problem. We want to work with something that had more meaning to us, something we could be passionate about, and that possibly could have an important social statement attached to it. All of our paper products are 100% recycled. They do not have any smell. They are made up of 70% fiber from elephant dung and 30% post-consumer paper. All papers everywhere are made from a pulp mixture derived from fiber materials. The most common papers today come from wood fiber pulp from cut trees. Our fibers of choice, of course, are dung fibers. We use the dung fibers from elephants to make our dung paper products.  
All elephants that generate the dung that we require for our process have at least two things in common: 1)  All are herbivores and have highly fibrous diets of different plants and vegetation. 2)  All possess inefficient digestive systems that do not completely digest and breakdown all the fibers that they eat. This results in a significant amount of fibers remaining intact when these animals dung. There are no toxic chemicals used in our paper making process. Natural vegetative binding agents, along with water-soluble salt dyes for coloring are used.

Our dung papers are handmade and acid free.  
We are focused on the production of dung paper for mass-market customers to give them the ability of making different stationery products, souvenirs, tourist-oriented products, up-market gifts and interior design items from natural products on advanced and unique designs. It would be easier for them to buy raw materials (paper) from us to produce needed products instead of making paper. It is easier for us at the beginning to set up the production of paper instead of setting up the whole paper production and of different kinds of stationery products at the same time. In the future we have plans about production of some additional stationery items aside from paper. Geant Corp. has the ability to product handmade dung paper for making such original items as, for example: ·         Bags
 ·         Frames
 ·         Photo Albums
 ·         Notebooks
 ·         Stationery
 ·         Cards 
  
However, first, we intend to launch a mass production of inexpensive handmade dung paper for making different stationery products and various tourist souvenirs, which were made using elephant dung. Potential Customers
    Our President and Director, Suneetha Nandana Silva Sudusinghe, will showcase our item and arrange with potential clients and wholesale purchasers. We expect to create and keep up a database of potential corporate customers who might be keen on our items. We will catch up with these customers intermittently and offer them free samples, presentations and uncommon rebates now and again.  Two fundamental classifications of our customers are:  ·       Wholesale exchange; speaking to expansive organizations, which are assembling diverse stationery items. It is their preference to purchase fit dung paper instead of making it themselves. Furthermore they have an opportunity to concentrate on the manufacturing process of stationery items. 
 ·       Corporate customers, speaking to extensive, medium and little scale organizations, different affiliations and so on. This is a somewhat generous fragment of the business sector, which develops and routinely creates interest for different corporate blessings, gifts; things that advance brand mindfulness and so on.
 Competition
 We know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of dung paper items and the competition is rather high. There are several companies that offer comparative items and we will have to compete with them. We see the main competitive advantage of our competitors in the established customer base and marketing outlets. Howbeit, we arranged on a wholesale exchange, for the most part, so we will have capacity to offer our item for extensive organizations in huge amounts. So our item is more extensive, the quality is better, and our ways to deal with business are more flexible.  One of our biggest competitive advantages is that our item is raw material for different companies.  Some of the factors that may affect our business are as follows:  1. Number of Competitors Increase: different companies may follow our business model of distributing high quality paper items made from elephant dung, which will reduce our competitive edge.  2. Price: Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our product at loss. 3. Substitute Products: competitors may substitute items made from elephant dung with comparable items made from dung of some other animals.  Marketing
    5  
    
   Our sole director and chief  executive officer, Suneetha Nandana Silva Sudusinghe, will be in charge of promoting of our company and our high quality dung paper. We intend to use such marketing strategies as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words and meta-tags, and utilizing link and banner exchange options. We will utilize numerous Internet showcasing instruments to direct activity to our site and distinguish potential clients. As of the date of this prospectus we have already purchased a website (www.geantcorp.com) and plan to develop it. We already have some description of our item, the procedure of production and incorporated some broad data and pictures of items companies can make from our paper.   Our site portrays samples of products which our Company is able to produce, the production procedure, and incorporates some broad data and pictures of high quality dung paper. We plan to utilize Internet advancement apparatuses on Facebook and Twitter to publicize our company and make connections to our site.  We will intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed.  
Description of property
    Our sole officer and director, Suneetha Nandana Silva Sudusinghe, has agreed to provide us his own premises at no charge. He will not take any fee for these premises. This premise is used for production of the goods.  
On  September 28, 2016 the Company has signed Rent office agreement, beginning on January 1, 2017, terminated on January 01, 2018 and was extended through Jan 1, 2019. These premises will be used as  representative office for the customers. The rent payment is $120 per month. For the year ended May 31, 2018 we have $1,423 of rent expense.  
Insurance
    We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. Research and Development Expenditures
 We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation. Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings
 There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees
 We currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director Suneetha Nandana Silva Sudusinghe.
