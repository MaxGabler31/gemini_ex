Overview
 We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on developing novel therapies to activate macrophages in the fight against cancer. We founded Forty Seven based on the insight that blocking CD47, a key signaling molecule that is overexpressed on cancer cells, renders tumors susceptible to macrophages. By harnessing macrophages, we believe that our lead product candidate, 5F9, can transform the treatment of cancer. 5F9 has demonstrated promising activity in six Phase 1b/2 clinical trials in which we have treated over 290 cancer patients with solid or hematologic tumors. In addition, we have two additional product candidates in preclinical development; FSI-189 an anti- SIRPα antibody and FSI-174 an anti-cKIT antibody.  We hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates. 
 We focus our efforts on targeting the CD47 pathway as a way to engage macrophages in fighting tumors. Macrophages function as first responders, swallowing foreign and abnormal cells, including cancer cells, and mobilizing other components of the immune system including T cells and antibodies. Cancer cells use CD47, a “don’t eat me,” signal, in order to evade detection by the immune system and subsequent destruction by macrophages. Overexpression of CD47 is common to nearly all types of tumors and is also correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers including acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, colorectal cancer, or CRC, gastric cancer, lung cancer, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, and ovarian cancer. Despite the central role of macrophages as cell-eating scavengers and first responders, the pharmaceutical industry is only beginning to bring this key group of cells into the fight against cancer. 
 Our company was founded by leading scientists at Stanford University who uncovered the fundamental role of CD47 in cancer evasion. They discovered that CD47 sends out a “don’t eat me” signal to macrophages that prevents macrophages from ingesting abnormal cells. This has been supported by multiple lines of evidence, including elevated levels of CD47 in a wide range of cancer cells and an observed correlation of a decrease in survival in patients with high levels of CD47.

Preclinical work performed in the laboratory of our co-founder, Irv Weissman, at Stanford University and at Forty Seven demonstrated that:

• | Inducing an “eat me” signal on cancer cells using certain chemotherapies results in improved targeting of tumor cells which is synergistic with blocking CD47.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our clinical trials are investigating four different strategies for developing CD47 therapies: as a monotherapy, in combination with tumor targeting antibodies, in combination with chemotherapies and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, in a wide variety of tumors, including both solid and hematological cancers. 
 The targeting of CD47 to make cancer cells susceptible to macrophages, a component of the innate immune system, is analogous to the approach used with checkpoint inhibitors and T cells, a component of the adaptive immune system. In less than five years on the market, T cell checkpoint inhibitors have become frontline therapies for certain cancers and we estimate that they generated over $9 billion in sales in 2017. Despite the success of T cell checkpoint inhibitors, these therapies have been shown to be effective only in a subset of tumors, highlighting the need for additional therapies. Analogous to the way cancer cells overexpress PD-L1 to avoid attack by T cells, cancer cells overexpress CD47 as a way to avoid destruction by macrophages. We believe targeting CD47 represents a compelling and complementary approach. 
 Our lead product candidate, 5F9, is a humanized IgG4 subclass monoclonal antibody against CD47 that is designed to interfere with recognition of CD47 by the SIRPa receptor on macrophages, thus blocking the “don’t eat me” signal. The design of 5F9 combined with our proprietary dosing regimen overcomes the toxicity limitations of previously tested anti-CD47 therapies. Across all study populations, 5F9 has been well tolerated with no maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, observed in any study despite dosing up to 45 mg/kg. The most common treatment-associated effects observed to date were the expected CD47-mechanism-based effects on red blood cells that leads to a temporary and reversible anemia. Other reported treatment related adverse events include infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, chills, fever and nausea. The majority of these adverse events were mild to moderate severity and were generally easily managed. See “Business—Our Lead Product Candidate, 5F9—Safety Profile of 5F9.” 
 We have treated over 290 cancer patients with 5F9 as a monotherapy, in combination with tumor targeting antibodies, in combination with chemotherapies and in combination with T-cell checkpoint therapies. While the primary goal of our trials has been to demonstrate safety, we also observed early signs of clinical activity in multiple tumor types.
 In our ongoing monotherapy trials, 5F9 treatment has demonstrated biological responses including a confirmed partial response and multiple cases of stable disease in Phase 1 patients with refractory AML. In biologic responders, we confirmed the presence of macrophages in tumor tissues and we observed that other components of the immune system, including T cells, had been recruited.
 We are also investigating 5F9 as a monotherapy in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. In a Phase 1 trial of 5F9, we observed confirmed partial responses in 2 out of 21 evaluable patients in a cohort with ovarian cancer receiving either 20 mg/kg or higher doses of 5F9, as of April 2018. Both were heavily pre-treated patients failing seven or more previous treatment regimens. One of these patients had a durable partial response of more than six months in duration.  We believe the signals from these monotherapy trials have been encouraging, however, the limited responses in these late stage patients are not adequate to trigger a registration trial as a single agent.

We are also pursuing multiple trials of 5F9 in combination with tumor targeting antibodies and chemotherapies in order to test the synergistic potency of these combinations. We believe that we can enhance the effect of 5F9 on cancer by using tumor targeting antibodies that bind to cancer cells and present an “eat me” signal to macrophages. Hence, we are combining 5F9 with tumor targeting antibodies such as rituximab and cetuximab. Based on our preclinical research and on publications by academic groups, we believe that this combination of an “eat me” signal by these antibodies and the blocking of a “don’t eat me” signal by 5F9 could be highly effective. We are conducting a Phase 1b/2 combination trial using 5F9 and rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory NHL. As of April 2018, 30 patients with refractory NHL have been evaluated in Phase 1b/2 and 14 (47%) have had an objective response during the dose finding study of 5F9 in combination with rituximab. In 10 (33%) of these patients, we observed a complete response, an uncommon therapeutic finding for such a heavily pre-treated population. In November 2018, the Phase 1b NHL findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Based on our application summarizing the early NHL trial data, the FDA granted Fast Track designations to 5F9 for the treatment of both relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large b cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and relapsed and/or refractory follicular lymphoma, or FL, in April 2018. Having obtained Fast Track status, we held an end of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA in July 2018 to further discuss our NHL trials. Interim results from this trial are expected in mid-2019. We are also conducting a Phase 1b/2 combination clinical trial using 5F9 and cetuximab in patients with CRC. Results from this trial are expected in the second half of 2019. 
 We are also exploring a combination of azacitidine, a chemotherapeutic, with 5F9 in patients with untreated AML and myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS.  We have shown in preclinical studies that azacitidine induces “eat me” signals on AML cells which leads to enhanced phagocytosis when combined with 5F9.  These results were presented at the 2018 American Society of Hematology meeting. We are conducting a Phase 1b trial of 5F9 with azacitidine in untreated AML and MDS patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy. Initial results are expected in mid-2019.
 We believe there is a strong rationale to combine 5F9 and T cell checkpoint inhibitors and we plan to pursue combination clinical trials in both solid and hematological tumors. 5F9 induces a potent anti-tumor T cell response by enabling macrophages to ingest cancer cells and present antigens derived from these cancer cells to T cells. Thus, we believe the combination of a T cell checkpoint inhibitor with 5F9 is likely to further enhance an anti-tumor T cell response and to further mobilize both the innate and adaptive immune systems to eliminate cancer. 
 In early 2018, we announced clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with two pharmaceutical companies to combine 5F9 with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, while retaining full economic rights to our products. Pursuant to these agreements, we are conducting clinical trials with Merck KGaA on the combination of 5F9 with BAVENCIO (avelumab) in ovarian cancer patients; and with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, on the combination of 5F9 and TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) in patients with bladder cancer and in patients with AML. The avelumab combination trial is underway and we dosed the first patient in June 2018. We believe the combination trials with atezolizumab will be initiated in the second half of 2019. We will supply 5F9, and Merck KGaA and Genentech will supply their respective drug products for these trials. 
 Our company was founded by leading scientists at Stanford University who uncovered the fundamental role of CD47 in immune regulation and applied these findings to the field of immuno-oncology. We have an exclusive license to this technology and to our lead product candidate, 5F9, from Stanford. Our goal is to accelerate regulatory approval of 5F9 through execution of multiple clinical trials in parallel to identify areas of highest efficacy. We have assembled a team of executives with broad industry experience in biologics and other therapeutics, as well as strong academic and clinical backgrounds. Our management team has worked for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Genentech, Gilead, Janssen R&D, PDL Biopharma, Inc., Premier Research, Sandoz Inc. and Zogenix. We have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our preferred stock to investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sutter Hill Ventures, Clarus, GV and Wellington Management Company, as well as, through the proceeds of our initial public offering, or IPO, of common stock which closed on July 2, 2018. We have supplemented funding through the receipt of government and private grants. We are eligible to receive up to $19.2 million in grants from CIRM and LLS as financial support for our clinical trials in AML, CRC and NHL, of which $13.5 million has been received through December 31, 2018.

Our Development Pipeline 
 The following table summarizes our development programs, target indications and current stages of development. 
 
Strategy 
 Our goal is to transform the treatment of cancer by leveraging our scientific expertise and lead product candidate to engage macrophages to help patients defeat their cancer. 
 Our strategy includes the following components: 
  
• | Maintain a focus on our core mission of helping patients defeat their cancer. By focusing on patients first, we believe we can realize the full potential of our therapies. Our initial efforts are directed at patients with high unmet medical needs, such as those diagnosed with AML, CRC, NHL or ovarian cancer. We believe there are patients with many other types of cancers that our product candidates can help.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the therapeutic and commercial potential of 5F9 by exploring its treatment of both solid and hematological tumors. Based on our understanding of the CD47 SIRPa pathway and data from preclinical animal models, we believe 5F9 has the potential to benefit patients in a broad range of tumor types and in combination with other approved oncology therapeutics. We are currently evaluating 5F9 in multiple clinical trials. These trials will read out in 2019 and 2020. Based on these data we expect to initiate additional trials with 5F9 to support regulatory approval and to explore the use of 5F9 in multiple cancer indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest early to secure a clinical and commercial supply of 5F9 to mitigate risk and ensure a timely regulatory approval. Although 5F9 utilizes standard antibody manufacturing processes, we recognize that any regulatory approval requires experience and expertise in the commercial manufacturing of 5F9. In 2016, we completed a strategic manufacturing agreement with Lonza, a global leader in biologics manufacturing. The multi-year arrangement helps ensure sufficient clinical material for our existing trials and provides a path to generate the required manufacturing information that is part of a BLA and initial commercial supplies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Pursue collaborative relationships and in-licensing opportunities to help advance and expand our product candidate portfolio. In addition to our internal drug discovery and development efforts, we plan to identify and pursue strategic collaborative relationships, partnerships and in-licensing opportunities to enhance the development of our current programs and access additional novel product candidates. As examples, in January 2018 we announced clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with both Merck KGaA and Genentech to explore the utility of 5F9 in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors. As part of those collaborations, we initiated the combination trial with avelumab in ovarian cancer in June 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepare for an active role in commercialization in the United States while considering opportunities to engage with partners to access commercialization capabilities outside the United States. We have worldwide rights to 5F9. If 5F9 receives marketing approval in the United States, we intend to commercialize it with our own focused, specialty sales and marketing organization. We may explore partnering with a third party to commercialize and market 5F9 in certain geographies outside the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our knowledge and expertise in immune system and cancer biology to develop a pipeline of novel therapeutics. We intend to utilize CD47 and its associated immune activation pathways to their fullest potential to help patients defeat their cancer. This includes the development of our existing programs and the pursuit of new programs in the future. As an example, we recently advanced the product candidate FSI-174 for our cKIT program. The cKIT program extends the utility of anti-CD47 therapies to antibody conditioning regimens for a variety of transplant indications.

Scientific Background 
 The Role of Macrophages in the Treatment of Cancer 
 The innate and adaptive components of the human immune system form a complex organization of tissues, cells and proteins that serve to protect the body from invading pathogens. For the body to mount an effective response to a foreign cell or a cancer cell, the innate and adaptive immune systems must generally work in concert. 
 Macrophages, a key component of the innate immune system, serve as a first line of immune defense and initiate an immune response based on non-specific signals of foreign or abnormal cells. Macrophages also play a key role in alerting cells of the adaptive immune system to the presence of potential targets such as cancer cells. By making cancer cells susceptible to macrophages, we believe that our therapeutic candidates can be effective both as a monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapies, such as the PD-1/PD-L1-directed and CTLA-4-directed checkpoint inhibitors. 
 The Role of Macrophages in the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response 
 The innate immune system, of which macrophages are a key component, serves as the first line of immune defense. Macrophages specialize in engulfing and digesting cellular debris, foreign substances, invading microorganisms and other cells. Macrophages determine what to attack by recognizing certain “eat me” signals common to pathogens or cancer cells. 
 
Macrophages also play a key role in alerting highly-specialized cells of the adaptive immune system to the presence of potential targets, including cancer cells. Although these highly specialized adaptive immune cells take longer to mobilize, they are capable of providing long-term, effective protection against specific antigens and, importantly, can recall antigens to which they have previously been exposed. As first responders, macrophages swallow the abnormal cells in a process called phagocytosis, digest them and recruit and activate the second line of defense, the adaptive immune system. 
 Interfering with Suppression of Immune Signaling Pathways 
 A critical capability of both the innate and adaptive immune systems is the ability to distinguish cells that are normally found in the body from foreign invaders. Components of both immune systems rely on the presence of certain surface proteins on cells that serve as markers for normal cells to prevent immune attacks. For the innate immune system, CD47 is expressed on cells throughout the body and functions as a “don’t eat me” signal to prevent attack by macrophages. Similarly, for the adaptive immune system, PD-L1 expression prevents attack by T cells. 
 8

Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology have demonstrated that interfering in the PD-L1-based immune suppression system allows the adaptive immune system to attack cancer cells, resulting in significant reduction in tumor burden and increasing overall survival in some cancers. These therapies are generally referred to as checkpoint inhibitors and include both therapies that target PD-1 or PD-L1 such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab as well as therapies such as ipilimumab that target another checkpoint known as CTLA-4. These agents, all of which target the adaptive immune system, have resulted in remarkable efficacy in some patients and, as of September 2018, were the focus of 2,250 active clinical trials. 
 To date, there have been no therapies approved that target the CD47 checkpoint of the innate immune system. Preclinical data have demonstrated that binding by a CD47 antibody increases antigen presentation by macrophages and stimulates the development of anti-tumor cytotoxic T cell responses. We believe that by targeting CD47 and activating the macrophage and other components of the innate and adaptive immune system, we can create a new class of therapies with the potential to treat multiple types of solid and hematological tumors. 
 The below table outlines our macrophage-focused approach targeting the innate immune system as compared to T cell checkpoint inhibitors targeting the adaptive immune system. 
 
The Role of CD47 in the Treatment of Cancer 
 There are two opposing mechanisms that macrophages rely on to determine whether to attack a cell: one set of markers found on some cells, including bound IgG and calreticulin, triggers an “eat me” signal; the other, centered around CD47, found on both healthy cells as well as many cancer cells, sends a “don’t eat me” signal. This “don’t eat me” signal is essential to prevent macrophages from attacking. Macrophages recognize CD47 through a receptor, SIRPa, that can specifically bind to CD47. Binding of SIRPa receptors on macrophages to CD47 on cancer cells prevents macrophages from attacking and digesting these cancer cells. Macrophages only remove cells whose balance of “eat me” signals outweigh the CD47 “don’t eat me” signals. 
 
9

Nearly all types of tumors overexpress CD47 as a way to avoid the innate immune system. Sending this “don’t eat me” signal prevents the initial attack by macrophages and other phagocytic cells. Because these cancer cells are not digested, the macrophages cannot present components of the cancer cells to the adaptive immune system thereby preventing the activation of T cells that could specifically target them. Expression of CD47 by cancer cells can thus render these cells invisible to innate immune recognition. Interfering with CD47 binding to SIRPa has the potential to activate an immune response to cancer cells that is upstream of current checkpoint inhibitors that target PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4. As shown in the following figure the overexpression of CD47 in many types of cancer has been demonstrated by a variety of scientific techniques. 
 
Overexpression of CD47 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers including AML, gastric cancer, lung cancer, NHL and ovarian cancer. In CRC patients with tumors containing high levels of macrophages and low levels of CD47 have increased long-term survival. 
 The progression from normal cell to cancer cell involves changes in genes and/or gene expression that can subvert normal cellular control mechanisms, and overexpression of CD47 represents an important checkpoint allowing the cancer cells to survive. In animal models, CD47-blocking antibodies have been shown to inhibit human cancer growth and metastasis by enabling the phagocytosis of cancer cells. CD47-blocking antibodies have been shown to exhibit potent synergy with tumor targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, cetuximab and trastuzumab. Thus, we believe CD47 has a strong potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of a variety of cancers. 
 Our Lead Product Candidate, 5F9 
 Our lead product candidate, 5F9, is a humanized IgG4 subclass monoclonal antibody against CD47 that is designed to interfere with recognition of CD47 by the SIRPa receptor on macrophages. By blocking this recognition, 5F9 removes a key self-recognition or “don’t eat me” signal, which allows the innate immune system to attack and dispose of cancer cells. We are currently investigating 5F9 in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in various cancers including AML, CRC, NHL, and ovarian cancer, as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies such as rituximab, cetuximab, avelumab and azacitidine. 
 10


The following figure shows the mechanism of action of 5F9. 
 
5F9 activation of macrophages to attack cancer cells can be further stimulated in combination therapies by supplying a tumor targeting antibody that can specifically recognize tumor-specific antigens. By binding to cancer cells, these antibodies become an “eat me” signal to macrophages. There are many tumor-specific antibodies in current clinical practice in oncology, including rituximab, approved for various lymphomas and some types of leukemia, and cetuximab, approved in CRC and certain head and neck cancers. The following figure shows the mechanism of action of 5F9 in combination with a CD20 therapeutic antibody, such as rituximab. 
 
Importantly, most normal cells lack an “eat me” signal and are therefore unaffected by the blocking of CD47. 
 11

5F9 Clinical Trials
5F9 monotherapy trials started in 2014 at a clinical trial center at Stanford University and in 2015 at a clinical trial center at Oxford University. The clinical trials with 5F9 and tumor targeting antibody combinations started in 2016 at multiple trial centers in the United States and United Kingdom. We currently have trials taking place in over 20 clinical centers in the US and the UK. We have treated over 290 cancer patients in the Phase 1 trials with 5F9 both as a monotherapy and in combination with therapeutic antibodies such as rituximab, cetuximab and avelumab. The primary endpoint of these trials was to determine the MTD and dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, in addition to objective anti-tumor responses. No MTD has been achieved in any trial despite maximum tested doses of 45 mg/kg weekly. The MTD for our trials was defined using the standard Phase 1 trial definition of being the highest dose level tested that generated a DLT rate of less than 33% in at least 6 evaluable patients. Secondary endpoints of these trials include evaluation of the serum concentrations of 5F9 and measures of clinical activity including how long patients responded to 5F9 and combination therapies, and their overall survival. These trials completed enrollment in 2018 and formal statistical analyses are ongoing. 
 
Our reported results use clinical assessment criteria that are in broad use as standard endpoints in solid tumor and lymphoma trials. In brief, patient tumor size is assessed at approximately eight week intervals by CT or MRI scan while on treatment and the greatest reduction or smallest increase in tumor size is reported as the “best response” per the criteria below. Patients who withdrew from the trial after receiving drug are reported by their best assessment if they completed an assessment or as “progressive disease” if they did not. The specific response measurements are RECIST 1.1 for ovarian and CRC trials, and the Lugano classification for NHL trials. Per RECIST criteria, a “partial response” is a result in which the tumor shrinks at least 30% without the growth of new tumors and a “complete response” is the abolishment of tumor mass without new tumor growth. Per Lugano criteria, a “partial response” is a result in which the tumor shrinks at least 50% or in which the metabolic activity of the tumor has reduced activity compared to baseline, without the growth of new tumors. A “complete response” is a result with the abolishment of tumor mass or tumor metabolic activity without new tumor growth. Patients with “objective responses” are those with either a partial or a complete response. Per RECIST criteria, a patient with “stable disease” has a tumor size that is between a less than 30% reduction and less than 20% growth without growth of new tumors. Per Lugano criteria, “stable disease” is defined as less than a 50% reduction in tumor size and less than 50% growth or no increase in metabolic tumor activity, without growth of new tumors. In our AML trials, response assessment criteria were per ELN 2017 recommendations. Using these criteria, the best monotherapy responses we observed were a “partial response” and cases of “stable disease,” which are defined as patients who lack a partial or complete response yet did not exhibit disease progression. Progression in AML is defined by increases in blast (or cancer) cells and in partial and complete responses there is a substantial reduction in blast cells. In addition, we report “biological responses” that indicate notable biological changes in the bone marrow that were associated with 5F9 therapy but did not meet the definition of a partial or complete response.
 5F9 in B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
 Combination Trial and Early Signs of Clinical Activity 
 Our most advanced ongoing clinical trial is an open-label, multi-site Phase 1b/2 trial of 5F9 in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL. The rationale behind this combination trial is to release the CD47 inhibition of the innate immune system, thus eliminating the “don’t eat me” signal, and use rituximab to provide the “eat me” signal through its binding to CD20 on the surface of NHL cells. We began recruitment in November 2016 and, as of April 2018, we had evaluated 30 patients in the Phase 1b/2 trial and continued to enroll patients in the Phase 2 portion. We anticipate enrolling at least 70 patients in this trial. In the Phase 1b portion of this trial, patients received full doses of rituximab with cohorts evaluating escalating doses of 5F9. The Phase 2 portion of this trial has separate treatment arms for relapsed or refractory patients with non-aggressive, or indolent FL, and those with aggressive DLBCL. 
 As of April 2018, we have obtained clinical response data from 30 patients in this Phase 1b/2 trial receiving 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg 5F9. Progression of the disease was controlled in 17 patients (57%), and 14 patients (47%) displayed an objective response. Ten patients (33%) were reported to have a complete response and 4 patients (13%) were reported to have partial responses. Importantly, the rate of clinical response increased with the 
 12

5F9 dosage. Clinical activity was observed in both DLBCL and FL patients. This is notable because these patients all entered the trial after failing multiple lines of previously approved therapies, including rituximab. Particularly, multiple complete remissions have been observed in both DLBCL and FL patients, which are uncommon given the heavily pre-treated nature of these patients. For example, one DLBCL patient had failed four lines of prior therapy and entered the trial with extensive disease that was rapidly progressing. After treatment for eight weeks, this patient achieved a complete response, with no evidence of lymphoma lesions or bone marrow disease. 
 
The figure below shows the preliminary results as of April 2018 from a Phase 1b/2 trial of 5F9 in combination with rituximab in relapsed or refractory NHL. Complete and partial response were evaluated by the Lugano criteria, which measures tumor size and metabolic activity.   
 


A secondary analysis of Phase 1b patients (n=22) in the NHL trial showed a trend with higher incidence of responses at higher doses.  This trend was not statistically significant given the low number of patients but as a result we expanded the number of cohorts in Phase 2 to explore both higher doses and a more intensive loading dose regimen.  
 13


An important consideration is the effect of rituximab treatment. Rituximab refractory is defined as nonresponse to a rituximab-containing regimen (monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy) or progression during any prior rituximab-containing regimen or progression within six months of the last rituximab dose in the induction or maintenance settings. A full 90% of responders met this definition of being rituximab refractory before dosing. Failure of prior therapies containing rituximab did not prevent patients from responding to the combination of 5F9 and rituximab in this trial. As of April 2018, approximately 90% of the patients who had an initial response continue to respond, suggesting durability. The duration of response is the time between initial response and subsequent disease progression or relapse. A common measure of durability is the midpoint of all responding patients’ response durations (the median duration of response). When the median duration of response is reached, 50% of patients will have relapsed and 50% will still be in response. As of April 2018, the median duration of response had not been reached for either Phase 1b DLBCL or FL patients and the median time on treatment was over six months and eight months for DLBCL and FL patients, respectively. We have observed some patients with extended responses or improving responses. For example, 1 patient continued in complete remission for over 14 months on treatment. Furthermore, 2 DLBCL patients converted to complete responses in follow-up assessments after an initial assessment of stable disease and partial response, respectively. While these results represent early data from a limited number of patients, the clinical activity reported is comparable to the durable response rates (responses of greater than eight months duration) seen with other approved therapies such as the CAR-T product YESCARTA (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in DLBCL and the kinase inhibitors ALIQOPA (copanlisib) and COPIKTRA (duvelisib), in FL. Furthermore, 5F9 has been well tolerated to date with no MTD observed, is easy to administer and in the majority of responding patients begins to show clinical activity at the first assessment made at eight weeks. The most common treatment-associated effects observed to date were the expected CD47-mechanism-based effects on red blood cells, which led to a temporary and reversible anemia. Other reported treatment-related adverse events include infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, chills, fever and nausea. The majority of these adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were generally easily managed. See “Business—Our Lead Product Candidate, 5F9—Safety Profile of 5F9.” These attributes may make 5F9 suitable for a broad range of patients. Based on our application summarizing the early NHL trial data, the FDA granted Fast Track designations to 5F9 for the treatment of both relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL and relapsed and/or refractory FL in April 2018. 
 The Phase 1b/2 portion of the NHL trial is ongoing and we anticipate presenting updated results including durability of responses and response rates from multiple dosing regimens at a major medical conference in mid-2019.

Market Opportunity 
 We believe there is a broad market opportunity for 5F9 in the treatment of NHL. B-cell NHL is a diverse group of cancers derived from B cells. The American Cancer Society estimated that 74,680 people would be diagnosed with NHL in the United States in 2018. The natural progression of NHL varies widely across multiple forms, including aggressive forms such as DLBCL and more slowly growing or indolent forms such as FL, which according to a publication in Frontiers in Oncology in 2013, account for 31% and 22% of all NHL cases, respectively. Without treatment, survival of aggressive NHL, such as DLBCL, is only a few months in duration. 
 As with other B cell lymphomas, FL and DLBCL cells express CD20 on the cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 are a key component of current therapy for B cell lymphomas. Rituximab was the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody developed and approved for the treatment of B cell NHL. The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy could result in an approximately 10-15% overall increase in survival at one year in patients of all ages. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to rituximab and of those that initially responded after treatment with rituximab as a monotherapy, but subsequently relapsed, a study has shown that approximately 60% are resistant to rituximab. 
 In 2017, a new approach to treating DLBCL known as CAR-T cell therapy was approved. This therapy requires removing blood stem cells from patients, genetically modifying them in the lab to attack DLBCL cells and transplanting them back into the patient, a process which can take several weeks. Although this approach has had some success, there remain significant safety limitations. This therapy is not available to patients who have highly proliferative disease, who cannot wait for treatment, or who cannot tolerate the transplantation procedure. We believe that 5F9 will not have these limitations. 
 5F9 in Ovarian Cancer 
 Monotherapy Trial and Early Signs of Clinical Activity 
 The first in human trial of 5F9 as a monotherapy was a multi-arm trial designed to test the safety and tolerability and to determine dosing in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial began in August 2014 and, as of April 2018, we have observed confirmed partial responses in 2 out of 21 evaluable patients in a cohort with ovarian cancer receiving either 20 mg/kg or higher doses of 5F9, as of April 2018. Both were heavily pre-treated patients failing seven or more previous treatment regimens. One of these patients had a durable partial response of more than six months in duration. Although the monotherapy response we saw was encouraging, we now believe the response rate in these late phase patients is not sufficient to justify a registrational trial. However, these observations, along with preclinical data, supported our clinical collaboration with Merck KGaA in the 5F9 avelumab combination study. 
Combination Trial with Checkpoint Inhibitor 
 In January 2018, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Merck KGaA to test 5F9 in combination with the T cell checkpoint inhibitor avelumab in ovarian cancer patients. We believe 5F9 activity will be enhanced due to avelumab binding PD-L1 on the cancer cells and stimulating phagocytosis via binding of the IgG1 isotype antibody to macrophage receptors. We selected the combination of 5F9 and avelumab based on the unique dual ability for avelumab to enhance both a T cell response as a checkpoint inhibitor and serve as a tumor-targeted antibody. Since PD-L1 is expressed on cancer cells, antibodies that target PD-L1 could serve as a tumor targeting antibody, similar to rituximab and cetuximab in NHL and CRC, respectively. However, an active Fc domain capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis is required. Avelumab is the only fda approved T cell checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD-L1 that has an active IgG1 Fc domain. Thus, the combination of 5F9 and avelumab may be a key competitive differentiator for combination strategies of CD47 blocking agents and checkpoint inhibitors. Indeed, our preclinical studies demonstrate that the addition of avelumab to 5F9 significantly enhances macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells.  In June 2018, we dosed the first patient of a Phase 1b trial in relapse refractory ovarian cancer patient. We expect to share initial results of the ovarian avelumab combination trial at a major medical conference in the second half of 2019.

Market Opportunity 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States with over 20,000 women in the United States diagnosed with ovarian cancer and approximately 14,000 die from this disease each year. The International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that, worldwide, there were approximately 225,000 cases of ovarian cancer leading to 140,000 deaths yearly. 
 Surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapies are widely used to treat ovarian cancer; however, the outcomes have changed little over the last several decades. According to the National Cancer Institute, the relative five-year survival rate has improved only marginally from 43.8%, observed from 2001 to 2007, to 46.5%, observed from 2007 to 2013. Treatment of patients with advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer with a combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin increased the progression free survival to 8.6 months from 5.8 months with carboplatin alone but has had no significant effect on overall survival. Recently a number of products that target poly ADP ribose polymerase, or PARP, a specific component of a DNA repair pathway, have been approved for use in ovarian cancers. These products include olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib. Research published in Molecular Oncology has demonstrated that the efficacy of these products is greatly enhanced in the subset of 5-15% of ovarian cancers with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Given the historical lack of improvement in survival rates and limitations of PARP therapies for the majority of cancer patients, we believe 5F9 has the potential to deliver an effective new class of therapy to address this unmet medical need. 
 5F9 in Colorectal Cancer 
 Combination Trial and Early Signs of Clinical Activity 
 We are investigating the combination of 5F9 and cetuximab in an open-label Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including CRC. The trial began in December 2016, and as of December 2018, we had enrolled over 70 patients at multiple sites in the United States. The first arm of this trial was a dose escalation stage with doses of cetuximab increasing up to the standard approved dose level combined with increasing doses of 5F9. Data from the 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg cohorts of the Phase 1b portion of the trial is available for 22 patients with CRC. Of these 22 patients, 2 (9%) had a partial response and 9 (41%) had stable disease as their best response. Importantly, at time of data cutoff in April 2018, the initial responding patient had maintained a durable response over eight months that was ongoing. This trial is ongoing and we expect to present data from patients in the Phase 2 arm of this trial in the second half of 2019. The following figure shows the responses in patients from this trial as of April 2018.

Market Opportunity 
 According to CDC estimates, CRC is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates that there were 135,430 new cases of CRC and 50,260 CRC related deaths in the United States in 2017. Almost 35% of the patients with a new diagnosis of CRC will die within five years. The risk of CRC increases with age, with 90% of cases diagnosed in individuals 50 years of age or older. Despite effective screening, leading to a reduction in the mortality from CRC, the number of cases remains high and is expected to increase worldwide to 2.2 million by the year 2030. 
 Treatment of CRC typically involves the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. Treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR antibodies as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in a subset of CRC patients, however according to a publication in Current Oncology in 2010, over 40% of patients do not respond to anti-EGFR antibody therapies and of those that do, resistance often develops. Specifically, cetuximab is ineffective in patients who have a mutation in the RAS gene, which represents approximately 40% of all patients. In addition, after initial treatments, the currently approved therapies for advanced CRC patients, such as regorafenib and triflouradine/tipracil (TAS-102), have significant toxicities, negligible response rates (less than 2%) and only a minimal survival benefit, increasing median survival by 1.4 to 1.8 months. We believe that there is an unmet medical need for a treatment option that improves outcomes for patients with CRC. 
 5F9 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome
 Monotherapy Trial with Signs of Biologic Activity 
 We are conducting a Phase 1 monotherapy trial in patients with relapsed or refractory AML in collaboration with the University of Oxford at multiple sites in the United Kingdom. Leukemic cells, called blasts or blast precursors, are the main driver and indicator of disease burden in AML. The trial began in November 2015, and reductions in the number of blast cells in patient bone marrow samples have been observed in 7 of the 18 patients (39%) in cohorts receiving 10 mg/kg or higher doses of 5F9, as of April 2018. One of these patients had a 50% decrease in blast count and prolonged stable disease for 11.8 months on study before progressing, which is more than double the average life expectancy for this refractory patient population. This patient also had a significant increase in T cells in the bone marrow during treatment, suggesting that 5F9 may have activated the adaptive immune system. 
 17

Combination Trial with Azacitidine 
 In February 2018, based on additional preclinical data supporting treatment using 5F9 in combination with azacitidine, we initiated a combination trial with azacitidine in AML and MDS patients. This trial is enrolling treatment-naïve patients that have AML and are unfit for intensive induction chemotherapy or have high-risk MDS where the standard of care is VIDAZA (azacitidine). We expect to present data from this follow-on trial at a major medical conference in mid-2019.
Combination Trial with Checkpoint Inhibitor 
 Based in part on these data and similar observations in preclinical models, in January 2018, we announced a clinical collaboration with Genentech to initiate a clinical trial exploring a combination of 5F9 with atezolizumab in patients with AML.  
 We have received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and the EMA for AML. 
 
Market Opportunity AML 
 AML is a hematologic cancer characterized by excessive proliferation of myeloid stem cells and their failure to properly differentiate into mature blood cells. AML is the second most common subtype of leukemia in adults. The American Cancer Society estimates an incidence of approximately 19,500 new cases in the United States in 2018. AML is generally a disease of elderly people, with more than 60% of diagnosed patients being older than 60 years. According to Cancer Research UK, the average five-year survival rate for patients with AML is 20%, but there are significant differences in prognosis depending on several factors, including the age of the patient and the presence of co-morbidities at the time of diagnosis. For patients under the age of 45, the five-year survival rate is approximately 57%, while for those over the age of 65 it is only 6%. There are likely multiple reasons for this difference, including the ability of younger patients to tolerate more aggressive therapy. 
 Current first-line treatments in AML typically involve aggressive chemotherapy, including alkylating agents and cytarabine potentially followed by stem cell transplantation, for younger patients with the aim to induce and then maintain long-term remission. This therapy is not recommended for older patients or patients with comorbidities, who are often not treated at all or are treated with low dose cytarabine or azacitidine. There is a single biologic, MYLOTARG (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), approved by the FDA for AML. Mean survival in AML patients over 75 years of age treated with gemtuzumab ozogamacin as a monotherapy was 4.9 months versus 3.6 months for those treated with the best supportive care. Significant myeloid and liver toxicities have also complicated the use of gemtuzumab ozogamacin in patients. Other more recently approved therapeutics for AML target subsets of patients with tumors containing specific mutations such as RYDAPT (midostaurin) by Novartis for those with FLT3 mutations and IDHIFA (enasidenib) by Celgene/Agios for those with mutations in IDH2. Additional combinations, such as VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) in combination with azacitidine, have also been recently approved for newly diagnosed AML patients who are age 75 years or older or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Despite these advancements, we believe there is a significant need for a safe, broadly effective AML treatment. CD47 is expressed to a higher degree in AML cells, including leukemia stem cells, than in normal blood cells, making AML an attractive potential indication for 5F9. 
 Additional Trials: Combinations with Checkpoint Inhibitors 
 We believe there is a strong rationale to combine 5F9 with T cell checkpoint inhibitors. 5F9 may induce a potent anti-cancer T cell response by enabling macrophages to ingest cancer cells and present antigens derived from these cancer cells to T cells. Thus, the combination of a T cell checkpoint inhibitor with 5F9 is likely to further enhance an anti-cancer T cell response and to further mobilize both the innate and adaptive immune systems to eliminate cancer. In this context, we collaborated with Merck KGaA to test the safety and clinical activity of 5F9 in combination with avelumab, an antibody targeting PD-L1 in patients with ovarian cancer.  Furthermore, we and our partner Genentech, are planning to test the safety and clinical activity of 5F9 in combination with atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, an adaptive immunity checkpoint, in bladder cancer. We believe that these trials will help us test a key hypothesis by determining whether 5F9 can further enhance the anti-tumor activity of checkpoint inhibitors that already have activity as a monotherapy.  We anticipate atezolizumab combination trials to start in mid-2019.

Safety Profile of 5F9 
 In our clinical studies, 5F9 has demonstrated signs of early clinical activity while being generally well-tolerated. The design of 5F9, combined with our proprietary dosing regimen, overcomes the toxicity limitations of previously tested anti-CD47 therapies. Across all study populations, 5F9 has been well tolerated with no MTD observed in any study despite dosing up to 45 mg/kg. The most common treatment-associated effects observed to date were the expected CD47-mechanism-based effects on red blood cells which led to a temporary and reversible anemia. Other reported treatment-related adverse events include infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, chills, fever and nausea. The majority of these adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were generally easily managed. Importantly, dosing 5F9 in combinations with other therapeutic antibodies and chemotherapeutic agents did not appear to adversely impact the safety profile of either 5F9 or the combination agent.
Minimizing the Effects on Red Blood Cells
 Red blood cells, like other cells in the body, express CD47 as a “don’t eat me” signal to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages. As red blood cells age, the levels of CD47 gradually decrease and the levels of “eat me” signals such as phosphatidylserine or IgG increase such that at some point aged red blood cells are engulfed by macrophages and removed from circulation. The levels of red blood cells in the body, however, are tightly regulated and the removal of aged or damaged red blood cells stimulates the production of new red blood cells. The administration of CD47 antibodies, such as 5F9, would be expected to block the “don’t eat me” signal on red blood cells resulting in premature loss of those aged red blood cells that bear sufficiently high levels of “eat me” signals. Indeed, this predicted loss of red blood cells and the associated anemia has been observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials of 5F9 but it is generally temporary and reversible in nature. The loss of red blood cells is compensated for by reticulocytosis, which is the synthesis of new red blood cells that leads to the gradual resolution of the anemia. Eventually the red blood cell level stabilizes as the average age of red blood cells shifts toward younger cells. 
 
To address this expected anemia, we designed a proprietary dosing regimen into our clinical trials in which clinicians administer a priming dose of 1 mg/kg of 5F9 that is sufficient to eliminate the aged red blood cells and trigger the process of reticulocytosis. A mild anemia with the first priming dose is therefore expected. This priming dose then enables administration of much higher and more efficacious maintenance doses of 30 or 45 mg/kg in subsequent weeks that do not induce further clearance of red blood cells. We believe our approach of administering a priming dose followed by maintenance doses is an important element in mitigating the known on-target effect of anemia that results from therapeutic blocking of CD47. 
 The initial first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of 5F9 was initiated by researchers at Stanford University in 24 patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. This design allowed dose exploration of both a priming dose and then potential therapeutic doses of 5F9. Eleven patients were treated in Part A of the trial, which was designed as a dose escalation trial with the goal of establishing a priming dose of 5F9 that would be tolerable while also still fully saturating CD47 on red blood cells. After a single dose of 1 mg/kg of 5F9, approximately 90% of CD47 molecules on red blood cells were blocked, whereas at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg approximately 50% of CD47 molecules were blocked. The 1 mg/kg dose was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. 
 
19

Part B of the trial investigated the safety and tolerability of weekly maintenance dosing of 5F9 in 14 patients treated at 1, 10, 20, 30 and 45 mg/kg, each following a single priming dose of 1 mg/kg. The study showed that this dosing regimen results in an early, temporary decline in hemoglobin levels corresponding to mild to moderate anemia during the first two weeks of starting therapy. In many patients, hemoglobin levels return to baseline by week four or later, even with continued treatment with 5F9 at significantly higher doses. The figure below illustrates the physiological response associated with the priming dose in a solid tumor patient. 
 
An additional common treatment-associated effect related to red blood cells is hemagglutination, or the clumping of red blood cells, which we believe is driven by the direct interaction of 5F9 with CD47 on red blood cells. We observe hemagglutination by microscopic examination of a blood sample typically in conjunction with the initial priming or maintenance doses. In the over 290 patients treated with 5F9 across indications, hemagglutination has not been correlated with significant adverse events or other clinical symptoms. 
 In order to evaluate the clinical risk of hemagglutination and to monitor for any effects this might have on the microvasculature, our Phase 1 monotherapy trial of 5F9 in solid tumor patients included baseline and weekly high resolution retinal imaging studies during the trial. The 163 scans obtained in solid tumor patients did not reveal any treatment related pathology, outside of a solitary, asymptomatic transient abnormal finding on the retina known as a cotton wool spot in a single patient who did not exhibit hemagglutination. We removed the requirement for retinal imaging due to the lack of significant retinal findings in a protocol amendment, which was accepted by the FDA without any related issues being raised. In addition, we presented at the 2018 American Society of Hematology meeting new information demonstrating that the priming dose utilized on our trials induces an elimination or “pruning” of CD47 from RBCs so that binding of 5F9 would be eliminated. 
 Patients with AML do not have the bone marrow capacity to stimulate reticulocytosis due to their disease and thus have to rely on blood transfusions to replace aged red blood cells that are eliminated by 5F9 treatment. Hemagglutination continues to be observed in these patients beyond the first or second dose of 5F9 as the transfused blood contains a substantial population of untreated red blood cells. These transfusions have been well tolerated. Similar to solid tumor patients, to date, no clinical consequences have been correlated with hemagglutination. 
 20

Other Safety Observations 
 5F9 has been dosed in over 290 patients with both solid and hematological tumors as of December 2018. Across all study populations, 5F9 has been well tolerated with no MTD observed in any study including in doses of up to 45 mg/kg. The most common treatment-associated effects observed were CD47-mechanism-based effects on red blood cells such as anemia. Other reported treatment-related adverse events include infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, chills, fever and nausea. Common drug-related abnormal laboratory observations have included transient hyperbilirubinemia, transient reticulocytosis and spherocytosis, all of which are consistent with the on-target effect of aged red blood cell clearance by 5F9. Lymphopenia was also observed but not associated with any clinical consequences including infections. These findings were more frequent following the first or second infusion, with substantially fewer drug-related events reported beyond the first 28-day treatment cycle. Infusion-associated reactions including fevers, chills, headache, chest/abdominal/back pain and infusion/hypersensitivity reactions are observed in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma during the initial two doses with 5F9 and generally not with subsequent doses. No consistent adverse events were observed at high or extended exposure and there were no consistent overlapping toxicities with other antitumor antibodies. In addition, no significant immune-mediated toxicities found in other T cell checkpoint inhibitors have been observed. Patients have been treated over two years without increases in safety signals.

Summaries of reported adverse events from the solid tumor and NHL combination trials are presented in the figures below.

Pharmacokinetics of 5F9 
 As part of the Phase 1 solid tumor trial design we measured the concentration of 5F9 in the serum of treated patients at various doses. At doses of 10 mg/kg and above the half-life of 5F9 is approximately two weeks. When dosed weekly at 10 mg/kg and higher the serum concentrations of 5F9 exceeded concentrations associated with activity in preclinical models. Our initial signs of clinical activity in patients with AML, CRC, NHL or ovarian cancers were all observed at doses of 10 mg/kg weekly or higher suggesting our preclinical model results are consistent with our clinical observations. Anti-drug antibodies were detected in 15 of 190 evaluable patients in our clinical trials; however, the presence of such antibodies were not associated with changes in 5F9 pharmacokinetics or clinical consequences. The anti-drug antibody rate for 5F9 (7.7%) is similar to other humanized antibodies. 
 
Preclinical and Translational Data 
 The role of CD47 as a key component of self-recognition in the innate immune system and its potential role as an immuno-oncology target has been published by Forty Seven and by our founders at Stanford University. These findings have been validated by independent publications from multiple academic groups. Some key findings of this preclinical research include: 

• | CD47 is overexpressed in a majority of tumor types;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Expression levels of CD47 are correlated with evasion of phagocytosis by macrophages;

• | High expression of CD47 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hematologic cancer and solid tumors;

• | Antibodies against CD47 promote antitumor activity in over 25 types of tumors including AML, CRC, NHL, ovarian cancer and others;

• | Dosing with anti-CD47 induces a “pruning” of the CD47 receptor from red blood cells such that the ability of 5F9 to bind to red blood cells is eliminated over time.

 23

An example of the anti-tumor potential of combining inhibition of the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal by 5F9 and the “eat me” signal from rituximab was observed in a mouse models of NHL. In these models, a highly aggressive human NHL cell line is used to introduce tumors into mice. When given as a monotherapy, 5F9 or rituximab monotherapy was only able to keep the tumor from growing larger. However, when 5F9 and rituximab were dosed together, significant shrinkage of tumors was observed within two to five weeks, as shown in the figure below. 
 

This reduction in tumor burden was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival with the majority of the mice exhibiting the disappearance or near-disappearance of their tumors, as shown in the figure below. This preclinical data and similar preclinical data in other animal models serve as the basis for our ongoing and future clinical trials. 
 

24

In an in vitro experiment we showed that exposing AML cells to azacitidine induces a specific “eat me” signal called calreticulin.  By combining inhibition of the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal by 5F9 with the “eat me” signal stimulated from azacitidine we observed significant combination activity in mouse models of AML. In these models, a human AML cell line is used to introduce tumors into mice. When given as a monotherapy, 5F9 or azacitidine modestly prolonged survival. However, when 5F9 and azacitidine were dosed together, there was significant shrinkage of tumors and prolonged survival for the animals treated with the combination as shown in the figure below.  

Translational Data
 
Analysis of the levels of 5F9 binding to CD47 during the clinical trials revealed that the priming dose of 5F9 not only triggered clearance of a subset of red blood cells, or RBCs, but also resulted in a near complete loss of CD47 on all RBCs—a phenomenon we term “CD47 pruning.” This pruning effect was RBC-specific; white blood cells and AML bone marrow blasts did not exhibit CD47 pruning. These clinical findings have been recapitulated in preclinical studies in mice and the observations were again RBC specific. We believe the loss of CD47 receptors from RBCs after the priming dose suggests that any 5F9 effects on RBCs during maintenance doses will be substantially reduced. These findings were presented at the American Society of Hematology in 2018 and provide a fundamental insight into the mechanism underlying how 5F9 is safely dosed using our proprietary dosing regimen.
 Importance of 5F9 in a Multipronged Approach to Treating Cancer 
 5F9 has the potential to be an important therapeutic contributing to a multipronged approach to oncology treatment. While the field of immuno-oncology is a growing area of scientific focus, macrophage activation is missing from the current repertoire of biological oncology agents. Agents that target the CD47-SIRPa interaction can address this missing component. 
  
• | Monotherapy. Direct blockage of the CD47-SIRPa interaction enables macrophages to recognize cancer cells via endogenous “eat me” signals such as calreticulin as well as by antibodies to surface expressed antigens. Antibodies that are present endogenously or are provided therapeutically bind to surface antigens on cancer cells leading to their capturing and engulfing by macrophages in a process called antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis or ADCP. To date, no therapies have been approved that release macrophages from CD47-dependent inhibition. In our Phase 1 trials of 5F9 as a monotherapy we observed signs of clinical activity in AML and ovarian cancer patients validating the CD47 target and providing a foundation for exploring 5F9 in combinations.

• | Combination with Tumor Targeting Antibodies. Antibodies, such as rituximab, that recognize specific cancer cells trigger activation of natural killer or NK cells which result in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity or ADCC. Over twenty antibody products have been approved as therapeutics in oncology. These include antibodies that target antigens such as CD20 (rituximab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab), epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR (cetuximab, panitumumab), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (trastuzumab, pertuzumab), among others. These therapeutics represent a mainstay of cancer therapy, but have limited efficacy as monotherapies. Importantly, binding of these antibodies to cancer cells can also provide strong “eat me” signals triggering attack by macrophages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combination with Checkpoint Inhibitors. Cytotoxic T cells are components of the adaptive immune system that are specialized for targeting specific antigens on cancer cells. These may include naturally derived T cells that target tumor-specific antigens including neoantigens or antigens that arise from mutations within tumors. T cell agents also include a new class of cellular therapeutics such as CAR-T cells that are generated by genetic engineering, such as KYMRIAH (tisagenlecleucel) and YESCARTA (axicabtagene ciloleucel). A series of pharmacological agents known as checkpoint inhibitors have been approved as cancer therapeutics that function by relieving the active suppression of cytotoxic T cell activity. These agents include antibodies against PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, and PD-L1, such as atezolizumab and avelumab, as well as CTLA-4, such as ipilimumab. T-cell checkpoint inhibitors agents have limited efficacy when used as a monotherapy, and are currently the subject of over 2,250 clinical trials investigating their efficacy when used in combination. Phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages results in processing and presentation of tumor antigens to T cells, potentially increasing their efficacy.

• | Combination with Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the standard of care for many cancers but has limitations as normal cells are also sensitive to toxins used in chemotherapy. In addition, cancer cells can become resistant to these drugs, limiting clinical benefit, while the treatments produce many unwanted side effects. We and others have demonstrated that treatment of cancer cells with chemotherapies can produce “eat me” signals on the cells triggering attack by macrophages, enhancing the potential for 5F9 combinations.

Benefit of Macrophage Activation in Other Indications 
 In addition to the application of our technology in cancer treatment, anti-CD47 therapies could help macrophages target abnormal cells. Such cells may upregulate CD47 to escape detection by the immune system. Macrophages are the first line of defense against pathogens and the expression of CD47 on patient cells infected with viruses may prevent recognition of some viral infections such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, or Hepatitis B Virus, or HBV. We have worldwide rights to 5F9 in all indications. 
Other Preclinical Programs 
 We are working to develop additional products aimed at enhancing anti-cancer phagocytosis. This includes, but is not limited to the addition or enhancement of pro-phagocytic signals and further inhibition of anti-phagocytic signals. This development pipeline is balanced with preclinical agents at various stages of development, including a mix of both clinically validated and novel targets. 
 Other Potential Ways to Interfere with CD47-SIRPa Interaction 
 There are multiple types of pharmaceutical interventions that have been used to inhibit receptor-target interactions such as CD47-SIRPa. These have included antibodies that block the interaction by binding to either of the partners; small molecules and peptides that prevent the target from binding to the receptor or block downstream signaling events; and soluble decoy molecules that bind to one of the partners thereby preventing the other partner from binding productively. In addition to the 5F9, which is an antibody that binds to CD47 blocking it’s binding to SIRPa, we have also explored the potential of interfering with CD47 activity through other modalities. Our product candidate, FSI-189, is an antibody that binds to SIRPa. We plan to initiate Phase 1 solid tumor trials for FSI-189 in 2020. 
 Each of the different modalities has advantages and disadvantages and we believe that the central role of the CD47-SIRPa in regulating self-recognition in the innate immune system provides opportunities for multiple products to have therapeutic benefit in specific indications. Some SIRPa decoy molecules have a lower affinity for CD47 and thereby reduce the risk of red blood cell attack and subsequent anemia. However, these product candidates exhibited dose limiting toxicities at less than 1 mg/kg due to their toxicities on platelets. Antibodies that target SIRPa would be expected to be effective without targeting red blood cells, but, depending on their specific properties, these antibodies may not have any monotherapy activity. Specific variants of all of these modalities, such as whether antibodies are of the IgG1 subtype versus the IgG4 subclass, are expected to have different profiles based on interactions with other components of the immune system. 
 cKIT FSI-174 Program 
 
cKIT, also known as CD117, or stem cell growth factor receptor is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, as well as other cell types. Alterations of this receptor have been found in certain cancers including leukemia, melanoma and gastrointestinal stroma tumors.  Anti-cKIT antibodies can bind to cancer cells and provide an “eat me” signal to macrophages and have been shown to exhibit anti-cancer efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo mouse models.  In addition, preclinical studies with anti-cKIT antibodies in combination with anti-CD47 antibodies have been shown to deplete endogenous HSCs. This depletion allows for space in the bone marrow to facilitate transplantation of donor HSCs. The removal or depletion of endogenous HSCs is the goal of a pre-transplant procedure known as “conditioning.”
 27

Transplantation of HSCs is a well-established procedure that may be a potential cure for numerous severe and life-threatening diseases such as genetic blood disorders, blood cancers and autoimmune diseases. While significant advances have been made on stem cell preparation, the “conditioning” itself is still dependent on decades-old chemotherapeutic and radiation-based procedures. “Conditioning” has both acute and long-term toxicities and therefore limits the current use of HSC transplantation to a tiny fraction of patients that could benefit. 
 
Forty Seven aims to overcome this challenge with the development of its cKIT antibody, FSI-174. We believe that FSI-174 when combined with 5F9 or with FSI-189 would be an antibody-based conditioning regimen for HSC transplantation that is free of toxic chemotherapy and radiation. FSI-174 is in pre-clinical development and the first clinical trial is expected to start in early 2020. 
 
License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University 
 In November 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Stanford under which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicenseable license under certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property, including rights associated with the composition of matter of 5F9, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for use in certain licensed fields, the scope of which would include the application of the licensed intellectual property in oncology. The license granted to us in the agreement is exclusive, subject to certain pre-existing non-exclusive or exclusive rights that Stanford granted to third parties with respect to certain categories of the licensed patents in certain fields of use and retained rights by Stanford and all other non-profit institutions to use and practice the licensed patents and technology for internal research and other non-profit purposes. 
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid Stanford non-refundable license fees totaling $200,000, reimbursed Stanford for past patent expenses totaling approximately $933,000 and in November 2016 we issued to Stanford 1,000,160 shares of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Stanford ongoing patent expenses and an annual license maintenance fee ranging from $20,000 to $70,000, depending on the year, which will be creditable against any royalties payable to Stanford in any such year following the first commercial sale of licensed products under the agreement. We are required to make milestone payments up to $5.6 million in respect of the first three licensed products that successfully satisfy certain clinical and regulatory milestones in the United States, major European countries and Japan. The first clinical milestone payment of $75,000 was paid to Stanford in February 2018, recognizing the initiation of the Phase 2 trial of 5F9 in NHL. We also agreed to pay Stanford tiered royalties on a specified percentage of net sales made by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products at rates ranging from a low-to-high single digit percentage, subject to certain reductions and offsets, with the royalty rate on 5F9 reaching a high single digit percentage when its net sales exceed $3 billion. To the extent we enter into any sublicensing agreements granting rights to any of the licensed patents to a third party, other than the right to make, have made, use or sell licensed products on behalf of us or our affiliates, we will be required to pay Stanford a low-to-mid double digit percentage of all non-royalty income received from such sublicensees, which decreases based on our level of investment in the licensed products or licensed services and their stage of development. Our license, on a product-by-product and country-by country basis, shall become royalty-free and fully paid-up upon the later of (i) the date on which the last valid claim included in the licensed patents expires and (ii) the ten year anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product. 
 28

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the inventions covered by the licensed patent rights. We are also required to achieve certain specified milestones by specified times, provided that an extension of such timelines can be obtained upon mutual agreement by the parties. 
 Stanford retains sole responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of certain patents relating to SIRPa, upon consultation with us. We are responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of the other licensed patents, at our expense and using commercially reasonable efforts, but Stanford retains final approval of such matters. Except for the patents prosecuted and maintained by Stanford, we have the first right to enforce the licensed patents, at our expense. 
 We may terminate the license at any time for any reason with at least 30 days’ written notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate the license if we enter into an insolvency-related event or in the event of our material breach of the agreement or other specified obligations therein, in each case, that remains uncured for 30 days after the date that we are provided with written notice of such breach by Stanford. In addition, if we fail to achieve any specified diligence milestone by the specified time, Stanford has the right to terminate our license solely with respect to the applicable licensed products for which the milestone was not achieved, which could include 5F9. Our obligations to pay royalties that are accrued or accruable will survive any termination. 
 Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Merck KGaA 
 In January 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Ares Trading S.A., a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of 5F9 combined with Merck KGaA’s cancer immunotherapy, avelumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, we will act as the sponsor of the study and will hold the regulatory filings relating to the study. We will supply 5F9 and Merck KGaA will supply avelumab for the study, and we and Merck KGaA will jointly pay for the cost of the study. We will conduct the study under the supervision of a joint combination study committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of Merck KGaA and us. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we own the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to 5F9. Merck KGaA owns the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to avelumab. Both parties will jointly own the rights to inventions or discoveries relating to 5F9 and avelumab in combination. Each party has the sole right to prosecute and maintain patents relating to its solely owned inventions or discoveries, and we will be primarily responsible for, upon consultation with Merck KGaA, the prosecution, maintenance and defense of patents relating to jointly owned inventions or discoveries. We and Merck KGaA each have the first right to initiate legal action to enforce patents relating to jointly owned discoveries where the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from the development or sale of 5F9 or avelumab, respectively. 
 During the course of the agreement and for 90 days after our delivery of the final clinical study report to Merck KGaA, we agreed to work exclusively with Merck KGaA for any trials testing 5F9 in combination with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody in the specific field of ovarian cancer. In addition we have an option to initiate an additional study under the agreement to evaluate 5F9 and avelumab in combination in patients with a different cancer indication or another indication that may be agreed by the parties, which Merck may elect to co-fund at its discretion. 
 
The agreement will expire after 90 days following our provision of the final clinical study report to Merck KGaA. We and Merck KGaA each have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party. In addition, each party may terminate the agreement upon its own reasonable good faith determination (i) that the study presents a safety risk or (ii) that it is required to be terminated for medical, scientific, legal or regulatory reasons, or if an applicable regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the supply of its respective compound for use in the study. If Merck KGaA terminates the agreement for medical, scientific, legal or regulatory reasons relating to avelumab, we will be able to continue any study that is ongoing as of the effective date of termination. 
 29

Master Combination Study Agreement with Genentech, Inc. 
 In November 2017, we entered into a master clinical trial collaboration agreement with Genentech to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of 5F9 combined with Genentech’s cancer immunotherapy, atezolizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in two separate Phase 1b clinical trials (in patients with bladder cancer and AML, respectively). Pursuant to the agreement, we will supply 5F9 for the studies and will partially reimburse Genentech for its costs in connection with the bladder cancer study, and Genentech will supply atezolizumab for the studies and be solely responsible for all of its costs in connection with the AML study. Genentech will conduct the studies under the supervision of a joint development committee comprised of representatives of both parties. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we own the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to 5F9. Genentech owns the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to atezolizumab. Both parties will jointly own the rights to inventions or discoveries relating to 5F9 and atezolizumab in combination, without the right to assign or license any patents that relate to such jointly owned rights to third parties unless necessary for the research, development or commercialization of products utilizing the combination of 5F9 and atezolizumab. Additionally, each party grants the other a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable license to research, develop and commercialize combinations of 5F9 and atezolizumab. Genentech does not receive any rights from us to research, develop or commercialize 5F9 except in combination with atezolizumab and we do not receive any rights from Genentech to research, develop or commercialize atezolizumab except in combination with 5F9. Each party has the sole right to prosecute, maintain and enforce patents relating to its solely owned inventions or discoveries, and we and Genentech shall jointly prosecute, maintain and enforce patents relating to jointly owned inventions or discoveries. 
 As part of the agreement, we agreed to notify Genentech if we intend to commence discussions with a third party regarding an agreement to commercialize 5F9 in combination with a PD-L1 or PD-1 antagonist. Following such notice, we may not execute any such agreement until the earlier of 30 days following the date of such notice and Genentech’s written confirmation that it does not intend to discuss with us a similar commercial arrangement. 
 The agreement shall expire after the later of (i) five years after its effective date and (ii) the expiration, termination or completion of all studies being performed under the agreement. We and Genentech each have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 30 days after the date that such party is provided with written notice of such breach. In addition, subject to certain discussion obligations and limitations, each party may suspend or terminate a study under the agreement if, based on its review of the study data and other related information, such party determines that the study presents a safety risk or if an applicable regulatory authority withdraws authorization to conduct such study or takes any action that prevents the supply of 5F9 or atezolizumab for use in the study. 
 Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company 
 In August 2016, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly and Company and its subsidiary ImClone LLC, collectively Lilly, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of 5F9 combined with Lilly’s cancer immunotherapy, cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors and CRC. Pursuant to the agreement, we will act as the sponsor of the study and will hold the applicable regulatory filings relating to the study. Lilly will supply cetuximab for the study at no cost to us, and we will supply 5F9 and bear all other costs of the study. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we own the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to 5F9. Lilly owns the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to cetuximab. Both parties will jointly own the rights to inventions or discoveries relating to 5F9 and cetuximab in combination. Pursuant to the agreement, the prosecution, maintenance and defense of patents relating to jointly owned inventions or discoveries will be managed jointly by the parties. Each party has the first right to initiate legal action to enforce patents relating to jointly owned discoveries depending on whether the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from the development or sale of a biosimilar or interchangeable version of 5F9, in which case we will have the first right, or cetuximab, in which case Lilly will have the first right. Each party has the sole right to prosecute, maintain and enforce patents relating to its solely owned inventions or discoveries. 
 30

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire after each party completes all of its obligations under the agreement. Each party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party, for certain violations of anti-corruption and other applicable laws by the other party, if such party determines in good faith that the continuation of the study presents an unreasonable safety risk to patients, or if an applicable regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the supply of its respective compound for use in the study. In addition, we can terminate the agreement if we discontinue the development of 5F9, and Lilly can terminate the agreement if cetuximab is no longer commercially available. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We plan to build focused capabilities in the United States and European Union to commercialize our development programs focused on NHL, where we believe the patient populations and medical specialists for the indications we are targeting are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to effectively promote our product, if approved for commercial sale, with a targeted sales team. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, including Lonza and Biotechpharma UAB, or BTPH, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
 We have engaged Lonza to manufacture 5F9 for preclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label, package and distribute 5F9 for preclinical and clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term commercial supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval. 
 
In August 2016 and December 2017, we entered into development and manufacturing agreements with Lonza relating to the manufacturing of 5F9-related products and preclinical testing. The August 2016 agreement was amended in November 2017 to provide for the manufacturing of our other preclinical program related products. In July 2018, we entered into development and manufacturing agreements with BTPH relating to the manufacturing of FSI-174 related products and preclinical testing. For additional details, please see “Management Discussion and Analysis—Contractual Obligations and Commitments” section.
 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry and the immuno-oncology subsector are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of 5F9, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and durability. 
 31

We are aware that Celgene Corporation, Trillium Therapeutics, ALX Oncology, Arch Oncology, Surface Oncology, Novimmune, OSE Immunotherapeutics, Innovent, I-MAB BIOPHARMA, Aurigene Discovery Technologies and others are developing drugs targeting the CD47 pathway that may have utility for the treatment of indications that we are targeting.  We are also aware of competing cKIT antibodies being developed for conditioning treatments prior to transplantation by Magenta and Amgen/Stanford.
 As noted above, there are existing treatment alternatives in each of the indications we are targeting, and we will face competition from the incumbent drug therapies in each of those markets. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, more convenient, less expensive or with a more favorable label than 5F9 or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyright protection, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we own four U.S. provisional patent applications, three pending PCT applications and 14 pending foreign patent applications.  Our portfolio of licensed patents, which we license from Stanford, includes approximately 102 issued patents (26 of which are in the United States) and approximately 124 pending patent applications (23 of which are in the United States). These licensed patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2034 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. For more information regarding our license agreement with Stanford, please see “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements.” 
 Our patent portfolio licensed from Stanford contains patent families directed to the 5F9 composition of matter and methods of using 5F9 as a monotherapy and in combination with certain other therapeutic compounds, which are comprised of 11 U.S. issued patents, four U.S. patent applications and two granted European patents which have each been validated as national patents in 12 different European countries. These patents are subject to retained rights by Stanford to allow academic and non-profit research institutions to practice the licensed technology and patents for non-commercial purposes. In addition, some of these patents are subject to certain pre-existing non-
 32

exclusive rights that Stanford has granted to two third parties. In particular, a non-exclusive license to certain patents was granted to a third party in the field of research product sales and diagnostics for use in a flow cytometry platform. Another non-exclusive license to certain patents was granted to a different third party for the use of certain SIRPa proteins, SIRPa fragments and SIRPa fusion proteins as therapeutic agents for use in the therapeutics field. For clarity, we believe that these pre-existing non-exclusive licenses do not relate to 5F9 or our other product candidates or their use in the therapeutic field. These patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2034 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. 
 Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the delay by the USPTO, in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis and from country to country and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and any potential commercial partners and collaborators and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have implemented or intend to implement confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our selected consultants and any potential commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual or proprietary rights of third parties. The issuance of third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, change our products or processes, obtain licenses to additional third-party patents or other intellectual property or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. Given that patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference, revocation, derivation, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, or opposition proceedings brought by third parties or declared by the USPTO or an equivalent foreign body. 
 33

We have also obtained a sublicense to a family of patent and patent applications owned by Stichting Sanquin Bloedvoorziening, or SSB, and licensed to Synthon Biopharmaceuticals B. V., or Synthon, that encompass certain combination therapies for the treatment of cancer using anti-CD47 antibodies. This family of U.S. and foreign patents includes U.S. Patent No. 9,352,037, or the U.S. ‘037 Patent, the related European Patent No. EP 2 282 772, or the EP ’772 Patent, and its UK counterpart EP (UK) 2 282 772, or the UK ’772 Patent. These patents relate to the treatment of cancer with an anti-CD47 antibody or an anti-SIRPa antibody in combination with certain other antibodies, including rituximab or cetuximab. 
 We are also aware of an opposition filed by different third parties against European patent number EP 2 242 512, or the EP ’512 Patent, a European patent that we exclusively in-licensed from Stanford. The EPO opposition proceeding may involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims. The independent claims of EP ’512 patent was maintained in the EPO Opposition Division on November 15, 2018. The opponents may appeal the EPO Opposition Division decision to the Technical Boards of Appeal at the EPO. The outcome at the Technical Boards of Appeal cannot be predicted.  In addition, one or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against the EP ’512 Patent or other third parties may file future oppositions or other challenges, in Europe or other jurisdictions, against other patents that we in-license or own. The loss of priority for, or the loss of, the EP ’512 Patent or our other patents could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, including the above referenced intellectual property proceedings, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of products, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA in the case of a biologic such as 5F9;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 34

 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trial: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Each of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard BLA to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the BLA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain applications or supplements must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all BLAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biologic is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 36

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Pharmaceuticals manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

Orphan Drug Designation in the United States 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or supplemental BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 In August 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation in the United States for 5F9 for the treatment of AML. We intend to pursue orphan drug designation for 5F9 in additional indications, as well as for potential other future product candidates, in the United States and in the European Union as we deem it appropriate. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not obtain orphan exclusivity and that exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug or biologic from the competition of different drugs or biologics for the same condition, which could be approved during the exclusivity period. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of pharmaceutical products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request. In April 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designations to 5F9 for the treatment of both relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL and relapsed and/or refractory FL. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the agency may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s PDUFA review period for a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the agency believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have 
 38

continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our drug candidates, once approved, and negatively impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both. The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which is a federal law governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 
 39

Orphan Drug Designation in the European Union 
 In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
 Products authorized in the European Union as orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if: 
  
• | the second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In November 2015, the EMA granted orphan drug designation in the European Union for 5F9 for the treatment of AML. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 
 
For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. 
 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017 in May 2017. More recently, the Senate Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act without companion legislation to replace it, and a “skinny” version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. Each of these measures was rejected by the full Senate. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. 
 40

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, then-President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless Congress takes additional action. Recently, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
 We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 57 full-time employees, (i) 41 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and (ii) 16 of whom had an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 1490 O’Brien Drive, Suite A, Menlo Park, California, under a lease that expires in 2021. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs but expect to need additional space to accommodate our anticipated growth.
Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.
