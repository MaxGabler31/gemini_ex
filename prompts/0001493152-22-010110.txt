ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Vinco Ventures: Focused on Digital Media and Content Technologies
 
Vinco Ventures, formerly known as Edison Nation, Inc., Xspand Products Lab, Inc. and Idea Lab Products, Inc., is a Nevada corporation incorporated on July 18, 2017. In connection with the acquisition of an 80% equity interest in Lomotif by ZVV, our joint venture with ZASH in 2021, and our recent acquisition of AdRizer, we are transitioning from focusing on innovation, development and commercialization of end-to-end consumer products to innovation, development and commercialization of digital media and content technologies. We currently operate the platforms and businesses described below through our significant subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities:

● | Video-Sharing Social Networking Platform
--+-----------------------------------------

 
Lomotif and the Lomotif App - ZVV currently owns an 80% equity interest in Lomotif, a Singapore-based video-sharing social networking platform that is committed to democratizing video creation. The Lomotif app allows its users to create their own music videos by selecting pictures and videos from the camera, mixing them up with music and automatically transforming clips into music videos. Lomotif users can watch videos of other creators on the Lomotif platform and share their videos on the Lomotif platform or on various third-party social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Twitch. The Lomotif platform offers LoMoTV, a digital entertainment and lifestyle content network offering original programming.

The Lomotif app is available in the Apple and Google stores and is as a grassroots social community with dedicated users spanning from Asia, South America to the United States. As of the date of this Annual Report, Lomotif has not generated significant revenue and we are developing means to monetize the content creation and streaming capabilities of the Lomotif platform including our plan to leverage the AdRizer technologies to enable advertisers to more effectively engage with the Lomotif platform, content and its users.
 

● | End-to-End Fully Integrated Programmatic Advertising Platform 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
AdRizer and the Cortex Platform – Our wholly-owned subsidiary AdRizer provides technology solutions to automate the use of artificial intelligence for digital advertising analytics and programmatic media buying through its core platform, Cortex. Cortex provides real-time analytics for marketing spend and revenue optimization and delivers ad-campaign creation, optimalization and monetization at scale. Cortex integrates with various traffic partners, including Google, MSN, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and others, and is able to deliver real-time attribution against a wide range of advertiser and publisher metrics such as revenue by source, author, article, and conversion event. AdRizer targets advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers and other advertising technology companies as its audience for the Cortex platform offerings.
 
AdRizer generates revenue from the Cortex platform through two major sources: (1) the traffic acquisition of digital advertising spaces to advertisers from multiple digital advertising technologies, and (2) developing marketing campaigns and strategies for some of the top direct-to-customers (“DTC”) companies. We believe that AdRizer’s Cortex platform will allow small- to medium-sized enterprises with an efficient and effective end-to-end, fully integrated platform that allows its users to control their marketing and branding campaigns in real-time. We also expect to integrate AdRizer’s technologies with the Lomotif platform and content and the Honey Badger digital commerce company.
 

● | Streaming Music Non-Fungible Token (“NFT”) Platform 
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
E-NFT.com – Our wholly-owned subsidiary EVNT Platform LLC, dba Emmersive Entertainment (“EVNT”) offers a platform for artists and content owners to distribute their intellectual property. EVNT’s proprietary streaming process seeks to make NFT’s affordable by seeking to reduce mining fees with the goal of enabling fans to engage with content in new ways with EVNT’s multi-media delivery system. EVNT generates revenue from the development of custom, digital artwork and digital music that is sold in the form of non-fungible tokens through a third-party marketplace.
 

● | Full-Service Digital Commerce Company 
--+------------------------------------------

 
Honey Badger - Our wholly-owned subsidiary Honey Badger offers a full-service digital commerce strategies which is focused on brand specific messaging and designing comprehensive digital campaigns from creation to monetization for celebrities and influencers. As a digital commerce company, Honey Badger leverages millions plus followers in the network to grow advertiser-based revenue as well as Vinco’s brands and holdings. Honey Badger generates revenue from providing digital marketing services for brands and influencers.

● | New Consumer Product Development and Commercialization Platform 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Edison Nation – Led by our wholly-owned subsidiary Edison Nation, LLC, (‘Edison Nation”) we provide a platform to match an innovator’s intellectual property with vertical consumer product category leaders in a licensing structure whereby the innovator can earn up to 50% of the contracted licensing fee. Product categories include kitchenware, small appliances, toys, pet care, baby products, health & beauty aids, entertainment venue merchandise, and housewares. We also have a number of internally developed brands (“EN Brands”) which act as a launchpad for new innovative items that have matriculated through the innovation portal. These EN Brands include Cloud B, Pirasta, Uber Mom, Lily and Grey, Trillion Trees, and Barkley Lane. Additionally, we offer a partnership model for entrepreneurs and businesses that are seeking to elevate their existing brands. Recent partnerships for Vinco Ventures include 4Keeps Roses and Mother K. Within the partnership model, the Company seeks to identify new lines of distribution and provide innovation through development of new items that enhance the brand’s overall image and consumer adoption. Edison Nation generates revenue primarily from the sale of personal protective equipment, consumer products and licensing of products for intellectual property owners.
 

● | Cryptyde Businesses Expected to be Spun-Off
--+--------------------------------------------

 
Cryptyde – Our wholly-owned subsidiary Crytypde, Inc. plans to offer three initial business lines, Web3 (decentralized internet) products, Bitcoin mining services, and consumer packaging operated by Ferguson Containers, Incl (“Ferguson”). Through its Web3 products business line, Cryptyde will seek to acquire and build brands that use decentralized blockchain technologies in a variety of consumer-facing industries, such as music, movies, digital art, ticketing and event services, and gaming. Cryptyde’s Bitcoin mining services will aim to make Bitcoin mining accessible to consumers previously priced out of the area. Ferguson manufactures and sells custom packaging for a variety of products and is expected to offer revenue streams for the spun-off business.
 
Corporate Strategy
 
We are transitioning from focusing on innovation, development and commercialization of end-to-end consumer products to innovation, development and commercialization of digital media and content technologies. Today’s consumers have shorter attention spans and are unlikely to commit to lengthy content unless they are convinced of its value. The right piece of short-form content enables brands to rapidly communicate key messages, improving the asset’s ability to capture the attention of target audiences. Short-form content is also a ready-made resource for users who consume content on mobile devices. Additionally, video generates a much larger number of shares than long-form content, text or image posts. By investing in Lomotif, our short-form video sharing and social media platform, AdRizer and related growth initiatives, we are aiming to grow into an integrated robust social media, content development and digital advertising company, with millions of users around the world.
 
In February 2022 we acquired AdRizer. We expect to integrate AdRizer’s Cortex technologies with the Lomotif platform and content and Honey Badger and content to optimize revenue generation opportunities. We have also invested in activities to generate content for the Lomotif platform and to expand its user base and engagement such as launching LoMoTV, hosting and streaming concerts and celebrity events. We expect to further this effort by continuing to invest in acquisitions, joint ventures, and growing our own capacity to create and distribute content. For example, we expect that future joint ventures, licensing, loan financing or other arrangements with ZASH and PZAJ Holdings, LLC will generate entertainment content that we plan to distribute through the Lomotif platform, among other distribution channels.
 
In connection with our transition, we are also in the process of spinning off Cryptyde, which holds our packaging, Bitcoin mining services, and Web3 (decentralized internet) products businesses, in an effort to create value for our stockholders.

Cryptyde holds our packaging, Bitcoin mining services, and Web3 (decentralized internet) products businesses.

Our Markets and Competition
 
Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business.
 
Lomotif’s video-sharing social networking platform seeks to compete in general with companies providing media creation, media sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online. Large established companies such as Alphabet (Google and YouTube), Meta (formerly known as Facebook), Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter have significantly greater resources, user bases and reach. As a social media platform, Lomotif also seeks to compete with worldwide established video-sharing social platforms such as TikTok, Kuaishou, Snapchat and Instagram, all of which have significantly greater resources, user bases and reach. Lomotif’s large, established competitors generate significant revenue. Historically, Lomotif has not generated significant revenue. Lomotif seeks to attract, engage, and retain users and contributors, to attract and retain businesses that may use its services as those are developed, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with Lomotif’s products. In launching and increasing various streaming services, such as LoMoTV, Lomotif faces competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including major broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet-based e-commerce or entertainment video providers which are increasing their streaming video offerings.

AdRizer competes in the digital marketing sector against privately-held companies and public companies such as AdMob, The Trade Desk, Inc., Perion Network ltd., and Cardlytics, Inc. (NasdaqGM: CDLX). Vinco Ventures is focused on deploying AdRizer’s technology to monetize the content creation and distribution capabilities of the Lomotif short form video app.Vinco Ventures’ strategy of integrating the AdRizer technology with Lomotif also includes integrating the full-service digital commerce company Honey Badger, a subsidiary of Vinco Ventures that focuses on brand specific messaging and designing comprehensive digital campaigns from creation to monetization. Broadly, AdRizer also competes with traditional advertising media such as direct mail, television, radio, cable, and print for a share of marketers’ total advertising budgets.
 
Our Streaming Music NFT Platform business seeks to compete in the music NFT marketplaces that include key players such as OpenSea, SuperRare and Rarible.
 
Through EVNT, our full-service content monetization platform business faces competition from multiple companies in the influencer and content marketing categories. Direct and indirect competitors in the influencer marketing space include Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Linqia, and Upfluence. We also face competition in the creator economy from companies such as Fiverr and Upwork. In addition, there are many traditional advertising agencies, public relations firms, and niche consultancies that provide content development and conduct manual influencer outreach programs.
 
Our consumer products business led by Edison Nation seeks to compete with other online inventor platforms such as InventHelp, Quirky, Mako Design + Invent, Davison, and Invention City. Edison Nation also seeks to compete with large manufacturing companies that develop and commercialize their own products in categories in which Edison Nation currently participates. However, Edison Nation is also seeking to increase its “co-op-etition” footprint with companies that not only compete in product development but also have become active “cooperative” participants on the Edison Nation online innovation platform.
 
Cryptyde expects competition for Freespace, its video game that is developing and expects to launch in 2022, with companies including Decentraland, Sandbox and Fluf World. With respect to Cryptyde’s Bitcoin Mining Services Business, its competitors include Compass Mining, Miners Dep, and Alliance.
 
Competition could result in significant cost increases, price pressure, and reductions in our existing revenue streams and prevent us from establishing new revenue streams. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our products and services, we may compete with a greater number of other companies across an increasing range of different services. Many of our existing and future competitors have or will have significantly greater resources, brand recognition, technology advantages and expertise in the sectors in which we seek to compete. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining users, clients or consumers of our products and services relative to our competitors, our businesses, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.

Our Customers
 
We have generated our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily from sale of consumer products and packaging materials. Domestically, we sell our products to specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites. Internationally, we sell our products directly to similar retailers and distributors. As of December 31, 2021, two customers represented 15% and 11% of our total accounts receivable.
 
We have also generated a small percentage of our revenues from the digital media businesses in 2021, including from our EVNT platform by turning art and intellectual property into augmented and physical reality asset for artists and content owners and through Honey Badger by providing digital marketing services for brands and influencers.
 
Historically, Lomotif has not generated significant revenue. With our investments in promoting and monetizing the Lomotif platform, including our acquisition of AdRizer and expected integration of the AdRizer technologies with the content creation and streaming capabilities of the Lomotif platform, we believe that the Lomotif platform, coupled with AdRizer’s programmatic advertising products and services, represent the greatest potential for our revenue growth in the future. We also believe that AdRizer’s programmatic advertising products and services will represent a significant portion or most of our revenues in 2022.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property rights have significant value in the marketplace, and that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, that we must continue to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property.
 
We seek protection on our products and technologies in as many countries as practical, through registered trademarks and copyrights to the extent that such protection is available, cost effective and valuable to our products and brands. We also rely on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement which relate to our business.
 
Although we believe we are sufficiently protected, the failure to obtain or the loss of some of these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not experience significant seasonality other than our consumer products business and AdRizer’s programmatic advertising platform business.
 
Our consumer products business is highly seasonal with consumers making a large percentage of purchases during the traditional holiday season.
 
These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to our business associated with the underproduction of popular consumer products and the overproduction of less popular consumer products that do not match consumer demand.

10
--

 

These factors increase the risk that the Company may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that our own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers manage their inventories, we may experience cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause our sales to vary significantly from period to period.
 
E-commerce has partially reduced traditional seasonality to moderate seasonality. We intend to expand this flattening of traditional seasonality from e-commerce channels to our business as well, including through the continued emergence of crowd-funded “micro brands” that we believe will further delink demand for our products and services from historical demand fluctuation.
 
Advertising companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue, as many marketers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Historically, the fourth quarter has reflected AdRizer’s highest level of advertising activity for the year, and it generally expects the subsequent first quarter to reflect lower activity levels.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters important to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, digital assets, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States.
 
For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 46 employees, 45 of whom were full-time employees and 1 was part-time. In addition, Lomotif, a subsidiary of ZVV, which the Company consolidates as a variable interest entity into this report, had 64 full -time employees as of December 31, 2021. None of our employees are represented by a union or parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations to be in good standing.
