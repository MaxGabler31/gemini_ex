OUR STRATEGY
 
Since our inception more than 30 years ago, we have generated strong returns for our stockholders by incubating early-stage, high-growth businesses with investment capital provided by our more mature, cash-generating businesses. As these growth businesses scaled, we monetized many of them through sales or spin-offs to our stockholders.
 
To date, we have spun off five publicly traded companies, one of which was subsequently acquired:
 

■ | IDW Media Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: IDW), a publishing and entertainment company (2009); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Genie Energy, Ltd. (NYSE: GNE), a retail energy provider in the United States and Europe and developer of solar energy projects (2011); 
■ | Straight Path Communications, Inc. a holder of certain spectrum licenses that was purchased by Verizon in 2018 (2013); 
■ | Zedge, Inc. (NYSE American: ZDGE), an app developer focused on mobile phone personalization and entertainment (2016); and 
■ | Rafael Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RFL), a pharmaceutical company pursuing novel cancer therapies (2018). 

 
We are comprised of several high-growth, high-margin, tech-centric businesses as well as more mature, cash-generating businesses. Our businesses derive their competitive advantages leveraging one or more of our strategic assets including:
 

■ | The NRS, net2phone, BOSS Revolution, BOSS Money and IDT Global brands; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | A nationwide network of more than 30,000 retailers including over 25,000 who utilize our digital retailer platform; 
■ | Our customer base of more than eight million users, primarily in immigrant communities within the United States; 
■ | Our technology, global infrastructure and high-capacity transaction platforms; 
■ | Extensive VoIP and cloud services expertise; and 
■ | Our staff of more than 1,600 working in over 20 countries on four continents. 

 
Our high-margin, high-growth businesses include:
 

■ | NRS, an operator of a POS terminal-based network that enables independent retailers to operate and process transactions more effectively while providing advertisers and consumer marketers unprecedented reach into underserved consumer markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | net2phone, a UCaaS and CCaaS provider that intelligently integrates cloud communications across channels, platforms and devices for businesses globally; and 
■ | BOSS Money, a U.S. provider of international money remittances through digital and retail channels. 

 
The development of these three businesses has been financed with growth capital from the cash flows generated by our more mature traditional communications offerings. Consequently, we have not needed to rely upon debt financing nor dilutive capital raises to invest in these initiatives.

-


The key businesses in our mature, traditional communications offerings are:
 

■ | Mobile Top-Up; 
--+---------------------------------
■ | BOSS Revolution Calling; and 
■ | IDT Global. 

 
These traditional communications offerings participate wholly or partially in the paid minute voice communications market. This market is subject to intense revenue and margin pressure as consumers continue to migrate to free over-the-top voice and messaging services and to flat-rate international long-distance plans. We have successfully countered the bottom-line impacts of these trends thus far by continually innovating and deploying new features and enhancements to generate revenue and reduce overhead and operating expenditures for each of these offerings. For instance, our margin contributions for BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up have benefited from a gradual rotation to digital channels with higher per-unit margins. These trends and cost saving efforts have significantly offset the decreases in the paid minute voice revenue.
 
The increasing revenue and gross margin contributions from our high-margin growth businesses in combination with our efforts to maximize the cash generation of our lower margin, more mature offerings have enabled us to improve our consolidated bottom-line performance in recent quarters. We expect that this rotation toward our higher margin offerings will continue to drive increases in our operating margins.
 
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
Fintech
 
Our Fintech segment contributed 8.0% and 5.1% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, and is comprised of:
 

■ | NRS, an operator of a nationwide POS network providing payment processing, digital advertising, transaction data, and ancillary services; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | BOSS Money, a provider of international money remittance and related value/payment transfer services. 

 
During fiscal 2022, our Fintech segment generated $108.8 million in revenues and income from operations of $5.3 million, as compared with revenues of $74.3 million and a loss from operations of $1.5 million in fiscal 2021.
 
NRS
 
NRS’ revenues were $51.3 million in fiscal 2022, a 107% increase from fiscal 2021.
 
NRS operates a network of POS terminals at independent retailers including convenience, liquor and tobacco stores throughout the United States. The NRS solution includes integrated hardware and software tools that enable these retailers to operate more efficiently and compete more effectively against larger retail chains.
 
The POS terminal’s hardware includes cash registers, barcode scanners, retailer and customer-facing hi-definition screens, receipt printers and credit card readers. NRS’ integrated, proprietary software is offered to retailers as a service and provides operational tools including inventory management, sales tracking, price book management and other useful features. NRS technology teams in the United States and Israel continuously enhance the software and develop new features to better serve existing customers and facilitate expansion into additional retail market segments.
 
The primary market for NRS’ POS terminals is the more than 200,000 independently owned convenience, liquor, grocery, and tobacco stores in the United States, many of which primarily serve foreign-born communities.
 
NRS continues to increase the number of POS terminals active in its network. As of July 31, 2022, the NRS POS network included more than 19,000 terminals, an increase from 14,000 a year earlier. NRS’ POS terminal sales and marketing efforts are targeted, in part, to our nationwide network of BOSS Revolution retailers. NRS also markets and sells to retailers outside the BOSS Revolution network, including direct sales and through strategic relationships with more than 100 wholesale distributors including some of the largest cash-and-carry wholesalers in the United States.

NRS generates revenue from a portfolio of services for both retailers and third parties. The vast majority of revenue is generated by recurring services including:
 

■ | Display Advertising. NRS terminals feature 15” high-definition customer-facing screens designed to engage customers during check-out. The screens enable consumer package-good sellers and other marketers to offer coupons, deals, and promotions on in-store products through static and video advertisements with reach into urban demographic segments. NRS’ advertising offerings participate in the digital out-of-home, or DOOH, advertising market. DOOH is among the fastest growing advertising market segments. As it matures, we expect that the DOOH market will become increasingly accessible to programmatic advertising buyers, which would enable NRS to significantly increase advertising sales. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Merchant Services. The substantial majority of merchant services revenue is generated by NRS PAY, which enables retailers to accept and process payments made by credit cards, debit cards, and electronic benefits transfer. NRS PAY’s pricing model does not require a contract. NRS provides the NRS PAY equipment for free, and NRS does not charge hidden fees. Instead, NRS charges a flat, transparent rate per transaction. At July 31, 2022, we had over 10,300 NRS PAY customers compared to 5,800 a year earlier. 
■ | Data Analytics. NRS captures targeted POS transaction data from NRS retailers. These retailers are concentrated in urban communities with significant immigrant populations and, in the aggregate, constitute a significant but largely opaque market for data analysis and marketing. NRS has built a data platform that allows third parties to analyze purchasing trends at independent retailers and gain insights into this important segment of the consumer market. 
■ | Terminal-based software services. Terminal operators pay a monthly software as a service fee to operate each POS terminal. The monthly fee increases with premium POS feature sets. 
■ | Sale of POS Terminals. In addition to these recurring sources of revenue, NRS sells its POS terminals to retailers. Terminals are typically offered at a discount from the full retail price when retailers enroll in NRS PAY. 

 
NRS also supports our BOSS Revolution communications and payment offerings – BOSS Revolution Calling, BOSS Money remittances, and Mobile Top-Up, all of which can be sold and provisioned by retailers directly from their NRS terminals.
 
We believe that NRS’ competitive advantages include:
 

■ | A combination of hardware and software specifically designed to meet the unique store-management needs of independent retailers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | An engaging 15” hi-definition customer-facing screen at the POS terminal for displaying advertising and promotions provisioned via the NRS platform; 
■ | Focus on urban markets with high concentrations of first- and second-generation immigrants that provides advertisers and marketers with valuable reach and insight into these communities; 
■ | Through IDT, relationships with over 35,000 retailers nationwide; 
■ | Partnerships to enroll new retailers through cash-and-carry wholesale distributors; 
■ | For NRS PAY, simplified, transparent pricing with free card readers, no hidden fees and lower total cost to operate than most competitors; and 
■ | For NRS PAY, continued conversion of NRS terminal customers. 

 
NRS’ growth strategy includes:
 

■ | Conversion of current BOSS Revolution retailers to NRS POS and NRS PAY; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Expanding NRS POS terminal sales efforts to retailers who are not Boss Revolution retailers; 
■ | For NRS PAY, conversion of current NRS terminal customers, particularly as contracts with their pre-existing credit card processors expire; 
■ | Expansion into new retail verticals; 
■ | Development and deployments of new POS features and functionalities; 
■ | Further integrations with programmatic advertisers; 
■ | Expanding NRS’ internal advertising sales force to drive both programmatic and direct advertising sales increases; 
■ | Developing partnerships to provide NRS retailers with robust home delivery service options; and 
■ | Creation of a consumer app for remote ordering and delivery.

Competition
 
NRS competes against several nationwide POS companies that primarily serve other retail store segments, but also serve NRS’ target market of independent convenience, liquor, and tobacco stores in the United States. These competitors include, among others, Square, Clover, and NCR.
 
We believe that NRS’ competitive advantages include:
 

■ | NRS software and hardware are tailored specifically to the needs of independent retailers in contrast with other providers who primarily seek to provide POS solutions for larger retail chains with centralized decision-making; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Our relationships with the 35,000 retailers who sell BOSS Revolution Calling, BOSS Money, and/or our Mobile Top-Up offerings; 
■ | Our established direct sales and marketing capabilities focused on retail brands including our relationships with wholesale distributors who supply these stores; 
■ | Our consumer facing advertising screens and established relationships with supply side platforms in the DOOH advertising space; 
■ | Our ability to accept and target advertising and content in multiple formats to meet the needs of a diverse variety of potential buyers; 
■ | For our data business, the scale of our network and unique reach into the urban consumer convenience store market; 
■ | In certain states, our solution is licensed to accept electronic benefit payments that certain competitors may not be licensed to accept; 
■ | For NRS Pay, our unique pricing structure featuring flat, transparent pricing and no-contracts contrasts with established credit card processing providers; 
■ | Our ability to develop and leverage new solutions for retailers either directly or through third party providers attracted by our scale in the independent retailer market and flexibility of our platform; 
■ | Our fees for software as a service are generally well below the fees charged by competitors that serve large retail chains; 
■ | Our experienced and proven management team, many of whom have been with NRS since inception. 

 
NRS also competes with smaller, regional POS companies that focus on convenience stores. However, these regional players generally do not offer a comparable suite of POS services, have limited capacity to scale their platforms, and/or are not price competitive.
 
BOSS Money
 
BOSS Money revenues were $57.5 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of 16% from fiscal 2021.
 
International remittances are a primary economic activity for the tens of millions of first and second-generation immigrants in the United States. According to the World Bank, total remittances from the United States topped $74 billion in 2021.
 
BOSS Money enables customers in the United States to conveniently and affordably send money to third parties around the world. At July 31, 2022, BOSS Money provided its remittance service from the United States to 50 countries through 1,300 payer entities. Its payout network included over 316,000 cash payout locations worldwide in addition to direct deposit, mobile money and home delivery payout options.
 
BOSS Money is offered directly to consumers via our digital channels including the BOSS Money app, the BOSS Calling app, and the BOSS Money consumer website (www.bossmoney.com). Our retail channel comprises licensed and authorized BOSS Money agents nationwide.

-


During fiscal 2022, over three-quarters of BOSS Money’s transactions originated on our digital channels, predominantly in the BOSS Money app. The BOSS Money app enables customers with a debit or credit card to send money easily and securely directly from an iOS or Android device.
 
The BOSS Money retail network affords unbanked and underbanked customers the ability to initiate transactions with cash or a credit or debit card. We continue to build our retail origination network by using our internal sales force to recruit new BOSS Money retailers, primarily focusing on retailers that already provision BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up. In order to provision our service, BOSS Money retailers must meet certain stringent financial and other regulatory qualifications. We also continue to enhance the BOSS Money retailer portal and platform to make the transaction more convenient for retailers, many of whom have access to multiple remittance services.
 
We continue to expand our BOSS Money customer base by focusing our marketing efforts on converting the large BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up customer bases, as well as by targeting new customers directly, primarily through attractive fee and foreign exchange rate offers, through both our digital and retail channels.
 
BOSS Money generates revenues from a per-transaction fee charged to the customer and from foreign exchange differentials. Our transaction costs include commissions paid when the transaction is initiated by a retail agent, payment to the international disbursing agent, banking, compliance, foreign currency exchange costs and, for digital transfers, credit and debit card processing fees.
 
Competition and Competitive strengths
 
BOSS Money competes in the international money remittance space with both ‘brick and mortar’ services which operate primarily in retail locations through stores or authorized agents and a growing number of digital-only platforms. Most retailer-based originators of money transfers have now developed digital capabilities as well. Publicly traded companies in this category include Western Union, International Money Express, Inc. (Intermex), Ria, a subsidiary of Euronet Worldwide, and MoneyGram International, Inc. Money remittance providers that compete wholly or primarily through digital channels include Xoom (a subsidiary of PayPal), WorldRemit, Remitly, TransferWise and many others.
 
We believe that BOSS Money’s competitive strengths include:
 

■ | BOSS Revolution is an established and trusted brand that has served immigrant communities in the United States for over a decade. We spend significantly on BOSS Revolution branded marketing to support BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Money. Through the nationwide network of over 30,000 BOSS Revolution retailers, the BOSS Revolution brand has a high-visibility storefront presence in many communities with significant immigrant populations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | The BOSS Money app, which originates the substantial majority of our money transfers, is a proprietary, internally developed, scalable platform that has earned high marks from customers for its ease of use, reliability, and customer service; 
■ | Our nationwide retail channel enables underbanked and unbanked customers to initiate transactions with cash at BOSS Money retailers; 
■ | Our comprehensive compliance processes and procedures; and 
■ | Our experienced management team. 

 
BOSS Money’s growth strategy includes:
 

■ | Expansion of our international payout network with a focus on popular destinations in Africa; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Expansion of origination beyond the United States to Canada, United Kingdom and, potentially, to other European countries with large immigrant populations; 
■ | Continued migration of our BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up customers from competitors to BOSS Money; 
■ | Continued enhancement of our BOSS Money retailer portal; 
■ | Increasing the number of BOSS Money retail agents; and 
■ | Addition of new features and offerings.

-


We continue to compete successfully in part by migrating customers from our other BOSS Revolution offerings to BOSS Money leveraging our highly regarded BOSS Revolution brand, insights into our customers, and cross-marketing capabilities. We compete for customers outside the BOSS Revolution ecosystem primarily based on brand reputation, low fees, and competitive foreign exchange rates.
 
net2phone
 
net2phone’s revenues were $58.2 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $44.5 million in fiscal 2021. net2phone’s loss from operations was $11.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to a loss from operations of $15.5 million in fiscal 2021.
 
net2phone launched its UCaaS offering in 2015, leveraging our deep expertise in VoIP communications, established technology team, and global telephony network. net2phone enables its customers to transform their communications by leveraging its cloud platform to provide solutions that enable more intelligent, flexible and adaptive communications. net2phone’s flagship UCaaS service utilizes its cloud platform to provide conversational continuity across channels from any connected device – tethered or mobile – and to measure, manage and analyze those communications for enhanced insight and productivity.
 
net2phone’s offerings include:
 

■ | Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS): Business communications globally are rapidly evolving. Increasingly sophisticated cloud-based communications solutions are displacing siloed, multi-channel solutions and on-premise Private Branch Exchanges, or PBXs, which most businesses operate to support their legacy phone systems. net2phone offers unified communications as a cloud-based PBX with advanced Internet Protocol, or IP, desktop phones and as a bring-your-own-device solution accessed through its integrated web portal and mobile app. net2phone’s UCaaS service includes multi-channel communications with voice management features, unlimited domestic and international calling to over 40 countries, robust messaging and chat tools, voicemail to email transcription, client analytics, the net2phone Huddle video conferencing service, and reporting and system management capabilities accessed through its online console. net2phone’s UCaaS service integrates seamlessly with business communication platforms (such as Microsoft Teams and Slack), leading customer relationship management, or CRM, services (such as SalesForce, Zoho and others) and text-based communications platforms. net2phone adds features, enhancements and integrations on a regular basis leveraging its agile development philosophy.

■ | Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunking: net2phone’s SIP Trunking service provides high-quality voice channels from net2phone’s expansive VOIP network directly to the client’s on-premise IP-PBX. net2phone’s SIP Trunking service has been certified for compatibility with leading IP-PBX vendors such as Avaya and 3CX. 
■ | Cloud Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS): Prior to its acquisition of Integra, net2phone offered CCaaS services on a limited basis through resale agreements with CCaaS providers, including Integra and Five9 Inc. With the acquisition of Integra, net2phone offers more robust and integrated cloud CCaaS solutions. Integra provides omnichannel contact center solutions including workflows, forms, reports, dashboards, alerts, and monitoring for inbound, outbound, or blended contact centers. Integra also offers gamification components to improve employee efficiency and engagement. Integra’s CCaaS solution can be sold either as a stand-alone offer or as a bundled solution with net2phone’s UCaaS SIP Trunking offering. 

 
net2phone operates primarily in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Spain. net2phone’s customers are from a range of industries including professional offices, hospitality, construction, insurance, real estate, retail, technology, and others.
 
net2phone employs a channel-partner-first strategy in most of its markets whereby it distributes predominantly through its master agent, telecom agent, Managed Service Provider, and Value-Added Reseller partners. net2phone believes this strategy broadens its sales reach considerably to customers of all sizes, especially in its target market of small and midsize businesses, which rely heavily on channel partners to address their IT needs and are not the focus of many of its competitors. Currently, net2phone partners with over 2,500 active channel partners. net2phone is also investing in its direct-to-business channel, which is in the early stages of development across most markets and is expected to drive additional growth.

net2phone’s go-to-market strategy for both channel partners and direct sales focuses on owning its business customers, with customers billed and supported directly by it. net2phone’s sales approach is uniquely tailored to each geographic market. net2phone delivers differentiated, white-glove local support for channel partners and end users along with customizable packages and a partner-ready portal for seamless onboarding and management. net2phone’s channel partners and business customers choose its solutions as a result of its intuitive products, reliability, track-record of innovation, and accessibility.
 
net2phone’s value proposition for its channel partners includes streamlined offers with both bundled and unbundled options, extensive customization capabilities, frictionless and rapid quote generation, and competitive compensation – backed by net2phone’s dedicated channel team. For end users, net2phone’s solution typically replaces on-premise PBX systems. Key differentiators typically include net2phone’s advanced feature sets, white glove customer service, integrations with third-party software and deep localization. net2phone’s global infrastructure and locally based sales and customer support teams enable clients to retain the look and feel of localized customer and user experiences with local phone numbers, porting, native language support, and in-country sales teams.
 
net2phone’s marketing to channel partners and end users includes search engine marketing, search engine optimization, third-party lead generation platforms, social media marketing, and other forms of demand generation. net2phone’s indirect marketing funnels through its network of partners, master agencies, and affiliates and includes tradeshows and local events, support for digital marketing and other forms of demand generation.
 
net2phone primarily sells its solutions through the partner channel, overseen by field-based channel sales managers employed by us. net2phone tracks its acquisition costs closely across all channels to ensure it is acquiring customers in a cost-efficient manner and consistent with its targets for return on investment.
 
net2phone differentiates its position in the marketplace by leveraging its international assets which enables net2phone to enter and serve international markets in North America, Latin America and Europe. Secondly, by owning and managing its proprietary platform, net2phone is able to release new services and applications with an agile frequency and pace.
 
Following the Integra acquisition, net2phone is integrating a CCaaS marketing plan into some of its core marketing strategies. These include, but are not limited to, webinars, channel partner events, contact center industry focused events, Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, and Search Engine Marketing, or SEM, layered with ongoing channel sales training, proof of concepts and demos. As CCaaS sales opportunities will lead to more enterprise deployments, net2phone plans to implement a strong presales engineering cadence to qualify, ascertain and identify the key features and functionality that such client sets require.
 
net2phone growth strategy includes:
 

■ | Channel expansion. net2phone’s growth accelerates as it adds new channel partners and increases direct sales. As of July 31, 2022, we had over 2,500 active channel partner relationships. net2phone believes that its channel partner strategy, including the flexibility of go-to-market alternatives and the extensive support net2phone provides to its partners, creates strong incentives for resellers to partner with it. net2phone believes that its direct sales strategy is driving incremental expansion with direct sales generated via its web-based portals in all of its markets and led by its direct sales teams in Canada.

■ | CCaaS. net2phone’s CCaaS solution called Ucontact allows net2phone to expand its channel partner portfolio by adding partners that focus mainly or exclusively in the CCaaS space. Ucontact also expands net2phone’s total addressable market by allowing it to target larger enterprise accounts, BPOs and international Contact Centers, as well as entities that want an integrated UCaaS and CCaaS solution. net2phone expects these opportunities will increase its average user per customer considerably beyond what it experiences in the UCaaS space. In addition, Ucontact is expected to generate higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, while commanding stickier, longer term service periods with customers. 
■ | Focus on growing its small to medium business, or SMB, target market. The SMB market is highly fragmented in the United States and internationally. Many SMBs rely heavily on channel partners to address their IT needs and require customer support given limited in-house technology resources. Consequently, competition in the SMB market is less intense than in the larger enterprise market as most of net2phone’s competitors are not as focused on channel partners and have customer acquisition and support structures that are oriented towards self-service.

■ | Expanding portfolio of integrations. net2phone continues to pursue growth of its business by introducing new features and integrating new technologies to meet the needs of its customers. net2phone’s architecture is designed to allow for frictionless integration of new solutions, which enables it to react quickly to changing market conditions. net2phone continues to expand its portfolio of integrations with leading third-party CRM and text-based business collaboration platforms. net2phone’s UCaaS and CCaaS offerings integrate seamlessly with Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoho, Slack, Zapier, Salesforce and WhatsApp via its Omni channel CCaaS solution. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Leveraging regional infrastructure for deep localization. In North America, net2phone continues to outperform with streamlined offerings, channel partner expansion, and its direct sales channel. In Latin America, net2phone leverages its network infrastructure and regional expertise to provide a truly localized solution supported by knowledgeable staff and regional offices in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Mexico. Latin American markets generally exhibit lower levels of unified communications adoption and market leadership than in the United States and Europe, allowing net2phone to establish itself as an early mover within the market and gain significant market share. 
■ | Expand internationally. net2phone plans to continue its focus on growing our business within, and expanding to new, international markets. In both the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021, 48% of net2phone’s revenue came from international markets including Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Spain, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay. net2phone’s management team is skilled at building a strong sales and marketing presence in international markets and it believes this represents an attractive growth area. 
■ | One World, One Platform. net2phone’s cloud-based platform is designed to provide its unified communications service globally. This single-platform approach enables a consistent, holistic approach to new feature deployment, service upgrades, and marketing. The platform is deployed in the United States, Brazil, and Mexico to date. 
■ | Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments. net2phone may continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in order to strengthen its platform with new capabilities and solutions as well as to expand its position in its existing markets or to establish a presence in new markets. 

 
Competitive strengths
 
We believe that net2phone’s competitive strengths include:
 

■ | Proprietary communications-as-a-service product suite. net2phone provides a leading, proprietary cloud-based communications and collaboration platform for our customers. Key differentiators include net2phone’s advanced feature sets, proprietary CCaaS offering, white glove customer service, integrations with third-party software, and deep localization. Through net2phone’s platform, customers can access voice, video, chat and messaging services, softphone and mobile applications, customizable packages, and a partner portal. The seamlessly integrated solutions on net2phone’s platform are delivered and centrally managed through an intuitive, ‘single pane of glass’ master portal that allows channel partners and customers to easily monitor and manage the product offering. net2phone’s CCaaS offering provides call center agents software for customized campaign management, including inbound and outbound call management, messaging, gamification, reporting, and live monitoring. net2phone’s CCaaS offering is tailored for call centers ranging from 20 to 1,000 agents. net2phone supports seamless product suite integrations with leading third-party CRMs and text-based business collaboration platforms including Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoho, Slack, Zapier, and Salesforce, with new integrations added to meet demand. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Platform built for our channel partners. net2phone has built its platform to both serve the needs of its customers and to empower its channel partners. We believe that net2phone’s platform provides its partners with an effective way to market and sell its comprehensive solutions to new customers and manage its existing customers. In addition, net2phone’s integrations with leading third-party applications enable its partners to offer more comprehensive solutions. net2phone’s suite of solutions is delivered to the marketplace both quickly, intuitively, and precisely. net2phone has developed a proprietary partner portal exclusively for its growing partner community. net2phone’s channel partners are able to easily quote and deliver a net2phone proposal and agreement proceeding directly to onboarding. 
■ | Distribution power of net2phone’s more than 2,500 active channel partners enhanced with an emergent direct to consumer strategy. net2phone’s’ vast and growing partner network gives it tremendous leverage to grow its business customer base, increase revenue from our existing clients and expand its footprint to adjacent geographies. net2phone’s platform is tailored to support channel partners and includes channel incentives built into its pricing structure, technology platform, and support services. net2phone puts its channel and customer priorities first. Channel partners are motivated to sell net2phone’s offering due to its premier, localized channel partner support and marketing. While net2phone is primarily focused on strategically growing its channel sales, it has also been focusing on the expansion of its direct-to-business customer sales.

■ | Differentiated customer support and local market presence. net2phone offers channel partners and customers white glove customer service, integrations with third-party software, and deep localization. net2phone’s on-the-ground presence in international markets accounts for approximately 75% of its current personnel. Regional-based customer service and sales teams are a key differentiator and propel net2phone’s international business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Track record and focus on innovative solutions. net2phone’s long track record of innovation includes the development of its proprietary UCaaS platform, including the Huddle video conferencing service, as well as numerous patents around virtualized communication technologies. 
■ | Employee-friendly culture that allows net2phone to attract and retain talent. net2phone has sought to create a workplace and culture that is entrepreneurial, positive, employee-friendly and encourages its employees to work towards its shared goals of delivering innovative solutions to its customers and supporting its partners. As of July 31, 2022, net2phone has approximately 474 employees worldwide, with approximately 75% located outside of the United States. 

Competition
 
Major competitors to net2phone’s offerings include other UCaaS providers such as RingCentral, 8x8, Crexendo, Vonage, and Nextiva. Many of these companies offer more widely recognized brands, larger and more developed marketing and sales forces and/or channel agent networks, and more advanced product sets such as services designed specifically for call centers, messaging and chat, and solutions customized for specific market segments or verticals. These competitors’ offerings typically also support integration of their services with other well-known, third-party CRM vendors as well as with various Google and Microsoft applications.
 
The CCaaS market is fragmented, highly competitive and evolving rapidly in response to shifting consumer behavior, especially the rapid adoption of mobile devices and social media. The proliferation of each is driving change in contact center technology, as customers expect seamless communication across any channel according to their preference and needs. Combined with the disruptive nature of cloud technologies, this has resulted in competitors from different market and product heritages, varying in size, breadth and scope of products and services offered. net2phone currently competes with large legacy vendors that offer on-premise contact center systems, such as Avaya and Cisco. These legacy telephony vendors are increasingly supplementing and replacing their traditional on-premise contact center systems with competing cloud offerings, through a combination of acquisitions, partnerships and in-house development. Additionally, net2phone competes with vendors that historically provided other contact center services and technologies and expanded to offer cloud contact center software such as NICE, Five9, and Genesys. net2phone also faces competition from many smaller contact center service providers such as Talkdesk and Seranova, as well as vendors offering both unified communications and contact center solutions. In addition, Amazon, and Twilio have introduced solutions aimed at companies who wish to build their own contact centers with in-house developers. CRM vendors are also increasingly offering features and functionality that were traditionally provided by contact center service providers. CRM vendors also continue to partner with contact center service providers to provide integrated solutions and may, in the future, acquire competitive contact center service providers.
 
net2phone’s actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over it, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial and/or technical resources. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, net2phone expects competition to continue to intensify in the future. net2phone’s future acquisitions if any, may subject it to new competitors and cause it to face additional and different competition in the markets served by these businesses.
 
Traditional Communications
 
Our Traditional Communications segment, which represented 87.7% and 91.8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, includes:
 

■ | Mobile Top-Up, which enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging, and data to international and domestic mobile accounts; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | BOSS Revolution Calling, an international long-distance calling service marketed primarily to immigrant communities in the United States and Canada; 
■ | IDT Global, a wholesale provider of international voice and SMS termination and outsourced traffic management solutions to telecoms worldwide; and 
■ | Other, small businesses and offerings including early-stage business initiatives and mature businesses in harvest mode. 


11
--


During fiscal 2022, Traditional Communications generated $1,197 million in revenues and income from operations of $74.8 million, as compared with revenues of $1,328 million and income from operations of $81.3 million in fiscal 2021.
 
Mobile Top-Up
 
Mobile Top-Up’s revenues were $473.2 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $461.6 million in fiscal 2021 (39.5% and 34.8% of Traditional Communications’ revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively).
 
Mobile Top-Up enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging, and data to recharge or ‘top-up’ a recipient’s mobile phone account internationally (International Mobile Top-Up, or IMTU) or domestically (Domestic Mobile Top-Up, or DMTU). We offer IMTU for approximately 155 different carriers in 95 countries, primarily in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. The substantial majority of Mobile Top-Up’s revenue is generated by the sale of IMTU.
 
Mobile Top-Up leverages our platform capabilities, our distribution reach into foreign-born communities and our relationships with mobile operators around the world.
 
IMTU and DMTU are sold through the BOSS Revolution brand primarily through three channels:
 

■ | direct-to-consumer through the BOSS Revolution digital channel, including our BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Money apps, and the BOSS Revolution website; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | retail through our retail network including provisioning directly by retailers using our retailer platform and through mobile operator-branded top-up cards, and 
■ | wholesale, in which we provision IMTU offerings for other businesses. 

 
Mobile Top-Up’s growth drivers include deployment of additional data centric IMTU bundles to meet the demand for data from mobile phone customers in developing countries worldwide, migrating our current BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Money customers to our Mobile Top-Up offerings, further expansion into the wholesale market and the addition of new products enabling originators to pay for goods and services on behalf of the Mobile Top-Up recipient.
 
Competition
 
The major competitors to Mobile Top-Up include:
 

■ | international mobile operators, who seek to control more of their own distribution channel or create their own products that directly compete with our Mobile Top-Up; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | other service providers, distributors, and wholesalers, who develop a more comprehensive product offering than our Mobile Top-Up or aggressively discount their product offerings. 

 
We believe that the competitive advantages of Mobile Top-Up are:
 

■ | our direct connection to most of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 mobile carriers worldwide that improve margins and innovation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | access via stores and apps to the United States, which is one of the biggest and wealthiest diaspora markets in the world; and 
■ | our strong omni channel approach, which includes our retail partners, directly through our apps and website, and the wholesale channel. 

BOSS Revolution Calling
 
BOSS Revolution Calling’s revenues were $387.9 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $455.2 million in fiscal 2021 (32.4% and 34.3% of Traditional Communications’ revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively).
 
BOSS Revolution Calling is a prepaid international long-distance calling service marketed primarily to foreign-born and under-banked consumers in the United States and Canada, and a digital-only offering in Europe and Australia.

--


BOSS Revolution Calling includes our flagship ‘BOSS Revolution’ branded international long-distance prepaid calling service as well as disposable hard cards sold under a variety of brands. In the United States, BOSS Revolution Calling served, as of July 31, 2022, approximately 2.4 million customers per month.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling is offered through our digital channels – the BOSS Revolution Calling app and website, and through our extensive national network of BOSS Revolution retailers.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling allows users to place international long-distance calls at affordable rates from the BOSS Revolution Calling app or by calling an access number. Regardless of how the call originates, our customers must first establish and top-up a prepaid BOSS Revolution account that is linked to their phone. Customers can open a BOSS Revolution Calling account for free and top-up with a debit or credit card using the BOSS Revolution Calling app, through the BOSS Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com) or by phone, or with cash at any BOSS Revolution retailer. Once the account is established and a call is placed, our platform recognizes the customer’s phone through its network-provided automatic number identification and seamlessly links each call to the corresponding BOSS Revolution account. Callers then enter their destination phone numbers. BOSS Revolution Calling customers’ account balances are debited at a fixed rate per minute or at a fixed amount for calling plans to a specific country over a specified time period. In contrast to certain of our competitors, BOSS Revolution Calling does not charge connection, usage or breakage fees. BOSS Revolution Calling’s per minute rates vary by the destination country, city, and whether the call is placed to a landline or mobile phone. Rates are published on the BOSS Revolution consumer website and within the BOSS Revolution Calling app.
 
Users of the BOSS Revolution Calling app constitute the majority of our customers to date. At July 31, 2022, approximately 1.6 million customers per month utilized the BOSS Revolution Calling app.
 
In the United States, we distribute our BOSS Revolution Calling hard cards and other retail products primarily through our network of distributors that, either directly or through sub-distributors, sell to retail locations. In addition, our internal sales force sells BOSS Revolution Calling and other platform products directly to retailers.
 
At July 31, 2022, approximately 24,500 retailers per month utilized our digital retailer platform to provision customers, the substantial majority of whom pay the retailer in cash. In addition, we estimate that approximately 7,000 retailers resell our disposable hard cards without utilizing our retailer portal. BOSS Revolution retailers are typically independent retailers serving foreign-born communities with significant unbanked or under-banked populations.
 
The BOSS Revolution digital retailer portal can be accessed by any broadband enabled device. Through the portal, retailers can access our platform to create accounts for new customers, add funds to existing customer balances and execute sales transactions. The platform provides us with a direct, real-time interface with our BOSS Revolution retailers to create a cost-effective and adaptable distribution model that allows us to target and promote services directly to distributors and retailers, to introduce and cross-sell new offerings, and to rapidly adapt to changes in the business environment.
 
In the United States, the BOSS Revolution brand is supported by national, regional, and local marketing programs that include television and radio advertising, online advertising and grass roots marketing at community and sporting events. In addition, we work closely with distributors and retailers on in-store promotional programs and events.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling’s retail sales have traditionally been, and continue to be, strongest in the Northeastern United States and in Florida because of our extensive local distribution network. We continue to grow BOSS Revolution Calling’s distributor relationships and expand BOSS Revolution Calling’s retail network in other areas of the United States and Canada, including the Southwest and West Coast.
 
Competition
 
BOSS Revolution Calling is subject to fierce competition. While virtually any company offering communication services is a competitor, we face particularly strong competition from Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat-rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators, and VoIP and other “over the top”, or OTT, service providers. Outside the United States, we also compete with large state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies.
 
Many of these companies, including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, engineering, personnel, and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and larger customer bases than we do.
 
In addition to these larger competitors, we face significant competition from smaller prepaid calling providers.
 

13
--


From time-to-time, competitors may offer rates that are substantially below ours, in an apparent attempt to gain market share. In some instances, these rates are below what we believe to be the cost to provide the service. This predatory pricing can adversely affect our revenues and our gross margins.
 
The continued growth of OTT calling and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, and others have adversely affected the sales of BOSS Revolution Calling and our other prepaid calling services. We expect the popularity of these IP-based services—many of which offer free voice and/or video communications to continue to increase, which will increase substitution for, and pricing pressure on, our BOSS Revolution Calling and other international prepaid calling offerings. However, free services typically require both the caller and recipient to have a broadband connection. BOSS Revolution Calling utilizes telephone networks to enable voice communications even when neither party has broadband connectivity.
 
Many mobile operators offer unlimited international long-distance plans that include international destinations to which customers can place direct calls from their mobile phones without time limitation. These plans now include some of our most popular international destinations. The growth of these “international unlimited” plans adversely affects our revenues as these operators gain subscriber market share.
 
Our ability to compete successfully against these various operators and service providers stems from several factors, including:
 

■ | our interconnect and termination agreements, network infrastructure, and least-cost-routing system enable us to offer low-cost, high-quality services; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | our continued innovation with new plans tailored to the specific needs of different corridors and finding new ways of delivering more value to consumers striving to connect with third parties around the globe; 
■ | our extensive distribution and retail networks provide us with a strong presence in communities of foreign-born residents, a significant portion of which purchase our services with cash; 
■ | our continued migration of our existing customers to our digital platform including the BOSS Revolution Calling app; 
■ | our BOSS Revolution brand is often highly visible in these communities and has a reputation for quality service and competitive, transparent pricing; and 
■ | our offering of synergistic mobile top-up and payment services over the BOSS Revolution platform that customers can conveniently access from their accounts. 

 
Our ability to maintain and/or to capture additional market share will remain dependent upon our ability to continue to provide competitively priced services, to maintain our distribution and retail networks, to increase usage through the BOSS Revolution Calling app, and to innovate new products and services to fit the evolving needs of our customers.
 
IDT Global
 
IDT Global’s revenues were $292.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $361.0 million in fiscal 2021, contributing 24.4% and 27.2% of Traditional Communications’ revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
 
IDT Global is one of the largest wholesale carriers of international long-distance minutes in the world.
 
IDT Global’s telecommunications network is comprised of interconnections and commercial relationships that reach virtually every significant telecom operator globally. These relationships enable us to carry international telecommunications traffic to more than 200 countries around the world. IDT Global’s customers include our BOSS Revolution Calling and net2phone businesses, major and niche carriers around the globe, mobile network operators, and other service providers such as call aggregators. For many of these customers, particularly the major carriers, we engage in buy-sell relationships, terminating their customers’ traffic in exchange for terminating our traffic with them.
 
IDT Global offers competitively priced international termination rates at several quality levels. We can offer competitively priced termination services in part because of the large volumes of originating minutes generated by our BOSS Revolution Calling business, our global platform powered by proprietary software, our team of professional and experienced account managers and market makers, and our global network of interconnections and relationships with other telecom operators around the globe. IDT Global’s services are marketed and sold through our internal account management team and the IDT Express digital portal. IDT Express focuses on delivering wholesale voice and direct inward dialing, or DID, services to small and medium size businesses domestically and internationally.

Traditional Communications terminated 11.3 billion minutes in fiscal 2022, as compared to 15.1 billion minutes in fiscal 2021. IDT Global accounted for 7.7 billion minutes and 10.5 billion minutes of the total Traditional Communications’ minutes in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
 
IDT Global has a significant number of direct connections to Tier 1 providers in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Tier 1 providers are the largest recognized licensed carriers in a country. Direct connections improve the quality of the telephone calls and reduce the cost, thereby enabling us to generate more traffic with higher margins to the associated foreign locales. We also have direct relationships with mobile network operators, reflecting their growing share of the voice traffic market.
 
Termination rates charged by Tier 1 and other providers of international long-distance traffic have been declining for many years. Nevertheless, termination rates charged to us by individual Tier 1 carriers and mobile operators can be volatile. Termination price volatility on heavily trafficked routes can significantly impact our minutes of use and wholesale revenues.
 
In addition to offering competitive rates to our carrier customers, we emphasize our ability to offer the high-quality connections that these providers often require. To that end, we offer higher-priced services in which we provide higher-quality connections, based upon a set of predetermined quality of service criteria. These services meet a growing need for higher-quality connections for some of our customers who provide services to high-value, quality-conscious retail customers. As of July 31, 2022, IDT Global had more than 1,800 customers and had more than 325 carrier relationships globally.
 
IDT Global’s revenues are generated by sales to both postpaid and prepaid customers. Postpaid customers typically include Tier 1 carriers, mobile network operators and our most credit worthy customers. The majority of IDT Global’s prepaid customers connect via our IDT Express portal. IDT Express offers the convenience of a mobile self-service portal paired with dedicated account managers backed by customer support. Prepaid customers are typically smaller telecommunication companies as well as independent call aggregators.
 
IDT Global also offers outsourcing services to help fixed and mobile telephony operators enhance the profitability and value of their international voice operations. IDT Global offers these operators customized solutions, including full outsourcing, handing all inbound and outbound calls with or without switch management, and hybrid arrangements whereby the operator retains certain routes or customers directly. Pursuant to these deals, IDT Global collaborates with the operators to provide a full range of international long-distance services to their respective customers in-country and overseas.
 
IDT Global is subject to intense revenue and margin pressure as communications globally continues to transition away from international voice calling to video conferencing and other collaboration platforms, low-cost or free messaging services, free peer-to-peer voice calls available when both parties utilize broadband connections, and flat-rate international long-distance plans offered both by the largest mobile network operators and niche mobile virtual network operators.
 
Competition
 
The wholesale carrier industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers, primarily based on price and quality of service.
 
IDT Global participates in a global marketplace with:
 

■ | interexchange carriers and other long-distance resellers and providers, including large carriers such as T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | historically state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies such as Telefonica, Orange SA, and KDDI; 
■ | on-line, spot-market trading exchanges for voice minutes; 
■ | OTT internet telephony providers; 
■ | other VoIP providers; 
■ | other providers of international long-distance services; and 
■ | alliances between large multinational carriers that provide wholesale carrier services. 


15
--


We believe that IDT Global derives a competitive advantage from several inter-related factors:
 

■ | our BOSS Revolution Calling business generates large volumes of originating minutes, which represents a desirable, negotiable asset that helps us win return traffic and obtain beneficial pricing which we can offer in the wholesale arena; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | the proprietary technologies powering our IDT Global’s platform and, in particular, the software that drives VoIP enables us to scale up at a lower cost than many of our competitors; 
■ | our professional and experienced account management team; and 
■ | our extensive network of interconnects around the globe, with the ability to connect in whichever format (IP or TDM) is most feasible. 

 
We believe that these factors provide IDT Global with a competitive advantage over some participants on certain routes.
 
Communications and Payment Network Infrastructure and Technology Development
 
We operate a global network to provide an array of telecommunications and payment services to our customers worldwide using a combination of proprietary and third-party applications. Proprietary applications include call routing and rating, customer provisioning, call management, e-commerce sites and digital platforms, product web pages, calling card features, and payment services features. Proprietary applications provide the flexibility to adapt to evolving marketplace demands without third-party software releases, and often provide advantages in capability or cost over third-party solutions.
 
Our core voice network utilizes VoIP and is interconnected, where needed, through gateways to time-division multiplexing, or TDM, networks worldwide. This hybrid IP/TDM capability allows us to interface with carriers using the lowest cost technology protocol available. To support our global reach, we operate voice switches and/or points of presence in the United States, Europe, South America and Asia. We interconnect with carriers all over the world, including cellular, landline, and satellite through direct and indirect interconnects. The network includes data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, which house equipment used for both our voice and payment services, with smaller points of presence in several other countries. Our global network is monitored and operated on a continual basis by our Network Operations Center in the United States and Guatemala. We also use leading cloud providers to serve as host for some of our application infrastructure.
 
Our technology organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features of our products and services, as well as the continued improvement and iteration of our existing products and services. It is also responsible for operating and scaling our proprietary calling and payment services platforms including the underlying cloud infrastructure. Our research and development investments seek to drive core technology innovation and bring new products and services to the market. Research and development employees are located in our Newark and Minsk offices, as well as remotely distributed globally. Our research and development team consist of our software engineering, product management, quality engineering, voice engineering, business intelligence, systems and development operations teams. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our products and services.
 
Our technology organization uses a number of key performance indicators to track service quality. As of July 31, 2022, our technology organization has improved our aggregate service uptime from approximately 99.92% in fiscal 2021 to approximately 99.975% for fiscal 2022. The defect escape ratio, a measure of quality engineering for our flagship BOSS Revolution brand, was 3% in fiscal 2022, meaning more than 97% of product defects were detected and fixed before being released to our customers.
 
Our product offerings and go-to-market strategy continue to evolve, and we expect our product offerings to continue to become available to customers at more frequent intervals than our historical release cycles. Our Agile development methodology is characterized by a dynamic development process with more frequent revisions to a product release’s features and functions as the software is being developed. In addition, we have implemented a holistic portfolio management process, which has improved transparency and efficiency across the portfolio through a recurring cadence of business reviews.
 
REGULATION
 
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe what we believe to be the most important, but not all, current and proposed international, federal, state, and local laws, regulations, orders, and legislation that are likely to materially affect us.

16
--


Regulation of Telecom in the United States
 
Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over all telecommunication’s common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services. Each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to their provision of local and intrastate communications services. Local governments often indirectly regulate aspects of our communications business by imposing zoning requirements, taxes, permit or right-of-way procedures or franchise fees. Significant changes to the applicable laws or regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, that requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). In addition, beginning in October 2006, interconnected VoIP providers, such as our subsidiary net2phone, are required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. We also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service, FCC Regulatory Fees, and Local Number Portability (collectively, the Other Funds). We and most of our competitors pass through Universal Service Fund and Other Funds contributions as part of the price of our services, either as part of the base rate or, to the extent allowed, as a separate surcharge on customer bills. Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions. In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. As a result, our ability to pursue certain new business opportunities in the future may be constrained in order to maintain these exemptions, the elimination of which could materially affect the rates we would need to charge for existing services. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
Regulation of Telecom by State Public Utility Commissions
 
Our telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state, including both local and in-state long distance services are subject to the jurisdiction of that state’s public utility commission, or PUC. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, generally preempts state statutes and regulations that prevent the provision of competitive services but permits state PUCs to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law. We are certified to provide facilities-based and/or resold long-distance service in all 50 states and facilities-based and resold local exchange service in 45 states. In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements, consumer protection measures, and obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund and Other Funds. Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we both pay to local exchange companies and collect from long-distance companies for terminating in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions. State commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates, or establish rates through arbitration, for interconnection, including rates for unbundled network elements. Changes in those access charges or rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business.
 
Regulation of Telecom—International
 
In connection with our international operations, we have obtained licenses or are otherwise authorized to provide telecommunications services in various foreign countries.

Regulation of Internet Telephony
 
The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is generally less regulated than traditional switch-based telephony within the United States and abroad and, in many markets, is not subject to the imposition of certain taxes and fees that increase our costs. As a result, we are able, in many markets, to offer VoIP communications services at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to traditional telephone services. However, in the U.S. and abroad, there have been efforts by legislatures and regulators to harmonize the regulatory structures between traditional switch-based telephony and VoIP. This could result in additional fees, charges, taxes and regulations on IP communications services that could materially increase our costs and may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing advantages. Additionally, several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. These efforts could likewise harm our ability to offer VoIP communications services.
Money Transmitter and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations
 
Our consumer payment services offerings include money transfer and various network branded, also called “open loop”, prepaid card offerings. These industries are heavily regulated. Accordingly, we, and the products and services that we market in consumer payment services, are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including:

■ | Banking laws and regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Money transmitter and payment instrument laws and regulations; 
■ | Anti-money laundering laws; 
■ | Privacy and data security laws and regulations; 
■ | Consumer protection laws and regulations; 
■ | Unclaimed property laws; and 
■ | Card association and network organization rules. 

 
In connection with the development of our money transmission services and the expansion of our network branded prepaid card offerings, we have actively pursued our own money transmitter licenses. At July 31, 2022, we had received a money transmitter license in 48 of the 49 U.S. states that require such a license, as well as in Washington, D.C.
 
Regulation of Other Businesses
 
We operate other smaller or early-stage initiatives and operations, which may be subject to federal, state, local or foreign law and regulation.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We own numerous patents, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, domain names, trademarks, and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad; in particular our registered trademarks and brands: IDT®, BOSS Revolution®, and net2phone®. From time to time we have also acquired or licensed intellectual property relating to present and future business strategy. We believe that our technological position significantly depends on the technical experience, expertise, and creative ability of our employees to maintain both our current businesses and pursue future business development. Our corporate policies require all employees to assign intellectual property rights developed in the scope of, or in relation to our business to us, and to protect all intellectual property and proprietary information and materials as confidential.
 
Our global telecommunications switching and transmission infrastructure enables us to provide an array of telecommunications, internet access and internet telephony services to our customers worldwide. We rely upon domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property rights, regarding our infrastructure and global telecommunication network for our international telecommunications traffic and the international traffic of other telecommunications companies.
