Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and next-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. We have discovered and are developing muscle-directed investigational medicines that may potentially improve the health span of people with devastating cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases of impaired muscle function. Our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, we are developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact muscle function and contractility. 
 Our clinical-stage drug candidates are: omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac myosin activator, CK-136 (formerly known as AMG 594), a novel cardiac troponin activator, reldesemtiv (also known as CK-2127107), a novel fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (“FSTA”), aficamten (also known as CK-3773274 or CK-274), a novel cardiac myosin inhibitor, and CK-3772271 (“CK-271”), our second novel cardiac myosin inhibitor.
 Omecamtiv mecarbil is being evaluated for the potential treatment of heart failure. We previously announced positive results from GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure. On February 4, 2022, we announced the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had accepted for filing our new drug application (“NDA”) for omecamtiv mecarbil for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (“HFrEF”).
 CK-136 was discovered under our joint research program under the Amgen Agreement. In collaboration with us, Amgen conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose, single-center Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CK-136 in healthy subjects.
 Aficamten is a novel, oral, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor. Aficamten arose from an extensive chemical optimization program conducted with attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties that may translate into next-in-class potential in clinical development. Aficamten was designed to reduce the hypercontractility that is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (“HCM”). 
 Aficamten is being evaluated in patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM. Following the results from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 of REDWOOD-HCM (Randomized Evaluation of Dosing With CK-274 in Obstructive Outflow Disease in HCM), a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-finding clinical trial of aficamten, we are conducting start-up activities for SEQUOIA-HCM (Safety, Efficacy, and Quantitative Understanding of Obstruction Impact of Aficamten in HCM), the planned Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate aficamten in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM on background medical therapy for 24 weeks. 
 CK-271 is our second novel, oral, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor. CK-271 produces reversible dose and plasma concentration-dependent reductions in cardiac contractility without affecting heart rate in preclinical models. CK-271 reduces compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models of HCM and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
 Reldesemtiv selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Reldesemtiv is being evaluated for treatment in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, COURAGE-ALS (Clinical Outcomes Using Reldesemtiv on ALSFRS-R in a Global Evaluation in ALS).

Our research continues to drive innovation and leadership in muscle biology. All of our drug candidates have arisen from our cytoskeletal research activities. Our focus on the biology of the cytoskeleton distinguishes us from other biopharmaceutical companies, and potentially positions us to discover and develop novel therapeutics that may be useful for the treatment of severe diseases and medical conditions. Each of our drug candidates has a novel mechanism of action compared to currently marketed drugs, which we believe validates our focus on the cytoskeleton as a productive area for drug discovery and development. We intend to leverage our experience in muscle contractility to expand our current pipeline and expect to identify additional potential drug candidates that may be suitable for clinical development. 
 Corporate Strategy 
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and next-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, we are developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact muscle function and contractility. Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel drug products that modulate muscle function to improve patient health span, with the intent of establishing a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company. 
 In 2020, we articulated our five-year strategic plan, Vision 2025: “Leading with Science, Delivering for Patients,” enabling Cytokinetics to become the leading muscle biology biopharmaceutical company that meaningfully improves the lives of patients with diseases of impaired muscle function through access to novel medicines arising from its research.
 The key components of our five-year Corporate Strategy are: 
  
• | Achieve regulatory approvals for at least two drugs arising from our pipeline. We are committed to fueling a diverse and expansive pipeline of muscle-directed drug candidates advancing toward regulatory approval. As we advance our drug candidates into later-stage clinical development, we extensively evaluate previous clinical trial designs and results to assess key learnings that may be applied to our late-stage clinical development activities. We believe this may result in more successful later-stage clinical development activities that may increase the likelihood of achieving regulatory success and deliver effective therapies to patients that can address the needs of people living with devastating diseases of muscle impairment. Pursuing a broad-based clinical development strategy may afford us the opportunity to not be reliant on the outcome of a singular clinical program or clinical trial result, thereby potentially mitigating the risk of clinical development and regulatory hurdles. We or our partners have been conducting extensive clinical trials for our most advanced drug candidates and we believe that three drug candidates are poised to achieve potential regulatory approval by 2025 and we strive to develop compelling scientific, clinical and value-driven rationales that may lead to regulatory approvals.

• | Build commercial capabilities to market and sell our medicines reflective of their innovation and value. With a focus on disease areas for which there are serious unmet medical needs, we direct our activities to potential commercial opportunities in concentrated and tractable customer segments, such as hospital specialists and disease-specific centers of excellence, which may be addressed by smaller, targeted sales forces. In preparing for the potential commercialization of our drug candidates directed to these markets, we are focusing our activities on the key issues facing, physicians, patients and payors, including the principal drivers of clinical and economic burdens associated with these diseases. We have established alliances and collaborations with leading academic institutions and professional societies to analyze clinical and claims data to better understand the real-world burden of disease from a clinical and economic standpoint. We believe this approach may inform the value proposition that our potential first-in-class and next-in-class therapies may offer to various stakeholders within the healthcare ecosystem. Targeting unmet medical needs may provide us competitive advantages and support our development of a franchises in diseases involving muscle function. In the markets for our potential therapies, we believe that a company with limited resources may be able to compete effectively against larger, more established companies with greater financial and commercial resources. For these opportunities, we intend to build sales and marketing capabilities in North America and potentially in Europe with the goal of becoming a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company.

• | Generate sustainable and growing revenues from product sales. As we move toward becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, we expect to evolve our corporate development strategies to raise capital through a combination of strategic partnerships and equity capital financings to one that is sustained from product generated revenues that are expected to grow over time. We expect to successfully commercialize at least two of our drug candidates in the U.S. and potentially in Europe and achieve growing profitability. Through prudent investment spending fueled by commercial returns alongside other potential strategic partnerships and royalty monetization deals, we seek to provide investor returns while continuing to conduct proprietary research to support future commercial programs. Additionally, we strive to ensure sustainable growth of product sales and long-term profitability through lifecycle management strategies.

• | Double our development pipeline to include ten therapeutic programs. We believe that our extensive understanding of muscle biology and our proprietary research activities should enable us to discover and potentially to develop additional muscle directed drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action that may offer potential benefits not provided by existing drugs and which may have application across a broad array of diseases and medical conditions. Progressing related programs in parallel may afford us an opportunity to build a broader business that could benefit from multiple products that serve related clinical and commercial needs associated with impaired muscle function, muscle weakness and fatigue. In addition, this strategy may enable us to diversify certain technical, financial and operating risks by advancing several drug candidates in parallel. In 2020 we advanced five potential drug candidates through various stages of clinical development. As part of our five-year Corporate Strategy, we will expand our research discovery platform beyond muscle contractility to support doubling our pipeline to ten therapeutic programs.

• | Expand our discovery platform to muscle energetics, growth and metabolism. We expect that we may be able to leverage our expertise in muscle contractility to expand muscle biology research programs related to other areas of muscle function and which may extend to the potential treatment of other serious, yet adjacent, diseases and conditions. As most muscle-related diseases are accompanied by defects in metabolism or mitochondrial function, we also anticipate that treatments that modulate contractility could be additive with therapeutics that boost metabolic capacity. We can augment our industry-leading expertise in muscle contractility by building similar expertise in mitochondrial biology and technologies. Strategies toward enhancing our discovery platform into muscle energetics and metabolism include building human and capital resources for mitochondrial and metabolism research capabilities, expanding strategic academic partnerships, engaging the mitochondrial research community, engaging the mitochondrial disease advocacy community, and evaluating therapeutic and technology platforms for potential in-licensing.

• | Be the science-driven company people want to join and partner with. We build our science around patients and their families through authentic and ongoing engagement and are committed to transforming patients’ lives through our activities. Our goal is to provide employees with an opportunity to contribute to something bigger than any one of the individuals at the company. We believe that a commitment to a diverse, inclusive and respectful culture goes beyond what is “right” to do; it is foundational to building a successful, creative, and science driven company, and essential to develop a community of colleagues who are impassioned by our purpose to improve the lives of patients. As a patient-centric organization, we rely on an approach where clinical outcomes, patient experiences and patients’ goals for care intersect. We value our partnerships with industry, professional societies, advocacy organizations, vendors and academic institutions and aim to solicit ongoing feedback to ensure interests are aligned and collaborations are successful.

Research and Development Programs
 Our long-standing interest in the cytoskeleton has led us to focus our research and development activities on the biology of muscle function and, in particular, small molecule modulation of muscle contractility. We believe that our expertise in the modulation of muscle contractility is an important differentiator for us. Our preclinical and clinical experience in muscle contractility may position us to discover and develop additional novel therapies that have the potential to improve the health of patients with severe and debilitating diseases or medical conditions.
 Small molecules that affect muscle contractility may have several applications for a variety of serious diseases and medical conditions. For example, heart failure is a disease often characterized by impaired cardiac muscle contractility which may be treated by modulating the contractility of cardiac muscle. Similarly, certain diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness may be amenable to treatment by enhancing the contractility of skeletal muscle. Because the modulation of the contractility of different types of muscle, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, may be relevant to multiple diseases or medical conditions, we believe we can leverage our expertise in these areas to more efficiently discover and develop potential drug candidates that modulate the applicable muscle type for multiple indications.
 We segment our research and development activities related to muscle contractility by our cardiac muscle contractility program and our skeletal muscle contractility program. We also conduct research and development on novel treatments for disorders involving muscle function beyond muscle contractility.
 Our research and development expenses were $159.9 million for 2021, $97.0 million for 2020 and $86.1 million for 2019.

Cardiac Muscle Program
 Our cardiac muscle contractility program is focused on the cardiac sarcomere, the basic unit of muscle contraction in the heart. The cardiac sarcomere is a highly ordered cytoskeletal structure composed of cardiac myosin, actin and a set of regulatory proteins. Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell. It is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction. Our most advanced cardiac program is based on the hypothesis that activators of cardiac myosin may address certain adverse properties of existing positive inotropic agents. Current positive inotropic agents, such as beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or inhibitors of phosphodiesterase activity, increase the concentration of intracellular calcium, thereby increasing cardiac sarcomere contractility. The effect on calcium levels, however, also has been linked to potentially life-threatening side effects. In contrast, our novel cardiac myosin activators work by a mechanism that directly stimulates the activity of the cardiac myosin motor protein, without increasing the intracellular calcium concentration. They accelerate the rate-limiting step of the myosin enzymatic cycle and shift it in favor of the force-producing state. Rather than increasing the velocity of cardiac contraction, this mechanism instead lengthens the systolic ejection time, which results in increased cardiac function in a potentially more oxygen-efficient manner.
 Our earlier stage cardiac program is based on the hypothesis that inhibitors of hyperdynamic contraction and obstruction of left ventricular blood flow may counteract the pathologic effects of mutations in the sarcomere that lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. A targeted oral therapy addressing this disease etiology may improve symptoms, exercise capacity and potentially slow disease progression. 
 Amgen Strategic Alliance
 Our strategic alliance with Amgen to discover, develop, and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics designed to activate cardiac muscle, including omecamtiv mecarbil, for the potential treatment of heart failure was governed by the collaboration and option agreement dated December 29, 2006, as amended (the “Amgen Agreement”). Prior to the effective termination of the Amgen Agreement, Amgen had exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds subject to our specified development and commercial participation rights. Amgen also entered an alliance with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier (“Servier”) for exclusive commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”), including Russia; Servier has contributed funding for development and provides strategic support to the program.
 On November 23, 2020, we announced that Amgen had elected to terminate the Amgen Agreement and thereby end its collaboration with Cytokinetics and intended to transition development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-136 to Cytokinetics. 
 On December 23, 2020, we announced that Amgen notified us that Servier elected to terminate the sublicense agreement between Amgen and Servier for the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia (the “Servier Agreement”). The termination was effective as of March 18, 2021, at which time all development, commercialization and other rights with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil previously granted by Amgen to Servier reverted to Amgen.
 The termination of the Amgen Agreement was effective May 20, 2021, at which time worldwide rights related to the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-136 reverted to Cytokinetics. Cytokinetics and Amgen have entered into several agreements to facilitate the transition of the programs for omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-136 to Cytokinetics. 
 As a result of the termination of the Amgen Agreement and Servier Agreement, we are evaluating a wide range of corporate development strategies for potential co-development, co-commercialization and licensing deals in relation to omecamtiv mecarbil and our other drug candidates in order to mitigate the cost effects of these terminations and to enhance our commercial capabilities.
 In 2017, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “RP OM RPA”) with RPI Finance Trust (“RPFT”). Under the RP OM RPA, Cytokinetics sold a portion of its right to receive royalties from Amgen on future net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil to RPFT for a one-time payment of $90 million. The RP OM RPA provides for the sale of a royalty to RPFT of 4.5% on worldwide net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil, subject to a potential increase of up to an additional 1% under certain circumstances. As a result of the termination of the Amgen Agreement and pursuant to our obligations under the RP OM RPA, we and RPFT entered into Amendment No. 1 to Royalty Purchase Agreement, dated January 7, 2022 to preserve RPFT’s rights under the RP OM RPA by providing for direct payments by us to RPFT of 4.5% of our and our affiliates’ and licensees’ worldwide net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil, subject to a potential increase of up to an additional 1% under certain circumstances (if the FDA approves omecamtiv mecarbil on its target PDUFA date of November 30, 2022, the royalty owed to RPFT will be 4.9% of worldwide net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil).

Omecamtiv mecarbil
 Our lead drug candidate from our cardiac contractility program is omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac myosin activator. We are developing omecamtiv mecarbil as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure both for use in the hospital setting and for use in the outpatient setting.
 Omecamtiv mecarbil: Clinical Development
 GALACTIC-HF: GALACTIC-HF is a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil which was conducted by Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics. The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial is to determine if treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care is superior to standard of care plus placebo in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with high risk chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. GALACTIC-HF was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) with the FDA. GALACTIC-HF completed enrollment in mid-2019, having enrolled 8,256 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction in over 1,000 sites in 35 countries who were either currently hospitalized for a primary reason of heart failure or had had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening. Patients were randomized to either placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil with dose titration up to a maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily based on the plasma concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil after initiation of drug therapy. The primary endpoint is a composite of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event, whichever occurs first, with heart failure event defined as hospitalization, emergency room visit, or urgent unscheduled clinic visit for heart failure. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death; patient reported outcomes as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score; time to first heart failure hospitalization; and time to all-cause death.
 In 2020, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation for omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Fast track designation may potentially expedite the review of a drug that is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for such a disease or condition.
 On October 8, 2020 we announced the topline results from GALACTIC-HF and on November 13, 2020 we announced the primary results from GALACTIC-HF. The results of GALACTIC-HF show that after a median duration of follow-up of 21.8 months, the trial demonstrated a statistically significant effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to reduce risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular (“CV”) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care. A first primary endpoint event occurred in 1,523 of 4,120 patients (37.0%) in the omecamtiv mecarbil group and in 1,607 of 4,112 patients (39.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.99; p=0.025). This effect was observed without evidence of an increase in the overall rates of myocardial ischemic events, ventricular arrhythmias or death from cardiovascular or all causes.
The statistically significant reduction in the composite of heart failure events or CV deaths, without significant imbalances in the overall incidence of adverse events across treatment arms, was observed in one of the broadest and most diverse range of patients enrolled in a contemporary heart failure trial. GALACTIC-HF included both inpatients and outpatients, and with a high representation of participants with moderate to severe heart failure symptoms as well as lower ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure and renal function. 
 No reduction in the secondary endpoint of time to CV death was observed. Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 808 (19.6%) patients treated with omecamtiv mecarbil and 798 patients (19.4%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.11; p=0.86). The pre-specified analysis of change from baseline to week 24 in the KCCQ total symptom score by randomization setting (inpatient mean difference [95% CI]: 2.50 [0.54, 4.46], outpatient mean difference: -0.46 [-1.40, 0.48], joint P = 0.028) did not meet the significance threshold of P=0.002 based upon the multiplicity control testing procedure. No other secondary endpoints were met in accordance with the prespecified statistical analysis. 
 The effect of omecamtiv mecarbil was consistent across most prespecified subgroups and with a potentially greater treatment effect suggested in patients with a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤28%, n=>4,000, hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI 0.77, 0.92; interaction p=0.003). Omecamtiv mecarbil also significantly decreased NT-proBNP concentrations by 10% (95% CI 6-14%) at Week 24 compared to placebo. 
 The overall safety profile of omecamtiv mecarbil in GALACTIC-HF appeared to be consistent with data from previous trials. Adverse events and treatment discontinuation of study drug were balanced between the treatment arms. In general, the overall rates of myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias and death were similar between treatment and placebo groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and at 24 or 48 weeks between the omecamtiv mecarbil and placebo groups. There was a small but significant decrease in heart rate in participants assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo at both timepoints. Median cardiac troponin I concentration increased 4 ng/L (95% CI 3-5; limit of detection, 6 ng/L) from baseline with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo.

On December 7, 2020, we announced additional results from GALACTIC-HF. These results of GALACTIC-HF showed that the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on the primary composite endpoint in GALACTIC-HF was consistent across most prespecified subgroups and with a potentially greater treatment effect suggested in patients with a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤28%, n=4,456, hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI 0.77, 0.92; interaction p=0.003). Supplemental analyses of this lower ejection fraction subgroup in GALACTIC-HF showed that this potentially greater treatment effect in patients who received omecamtiv mecarbil was consistently observed in patients with characteristics that may indicate advanced heart failure status, such as being hospitalized within the last 3 months (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 – 0.93, p=0.001), having New York Association Class III or IV heart failure (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 – 0.90, p<0.001), higher N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide levels (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p<0.001), and lower blood pressures (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 – 0.92, p=0.002). The absolute risk reductions (ARR) ranged from 5.2% to 8.1% in these subgroups as compared to the ARR of 2.1% observed in the overall population.
 Additionally, a supplemental analysis of the continuous relationship between ejection fraction and the hazard ratio for the primary composite endpoint in GALACTIC-HF suggested a potentially stronger treatment effect of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with increasingly lower ejection fractions.
 On May 17, 2021, at the American College of Cardiology 70th Annual Scientific Session, we announced data from a secondary analysis of GALACTIC-HF assessing the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on clinical outcomes in relationship to patient baseline ejection fraction. The analysis evaluated the effect of patient treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil based on quartiles of baseline EF defined as EF ≤22%, EF 23-28%, EF 29-32% and EF ≥33% as well as considering baseline EF as a continuous variable. The incidence of the primary outcome of first heart failure event or cardiovascular death increased with decreasing ejection fraction; in the lowest LVEF quartile (EF ≤22%) the incidence (35.6 per 100 patient-years) was almost 80% greater than in the highest EF quartile (EF ≥33%; 20 per 100 patient-years). Treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil demonstrated a 15% (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.97; p = 0.016) and 17% (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.95; p = 0.005) relative risk reduction in the lower two quartiles, respectively, compared to no difference in the upper two quartiles.
 Analysis of ejection fraction as a continuous variable demonstrated a progressively larger treatment effect of omecamtiv mecarbil with decreasing ejection fraction. Accordingly, the absolute treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint also increased between the patients treated with placebo and omecamtiv mecarbil as baseline ejection fraction decreased such that in the lowest ejection fraction quartile, there was an absolute reduction of 7.4 events per 100 patient-years, with a number-needed-to-treat of 11.8 patients necessary to prevent an event over three years.
 On June 30, 2021, at the European Society of Cardiology-Heart Failure Congress, we announced additional analyses from GALACTIC-HF demonstrating patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter have increased treatment effect with omecamtiv mecarbil; patients with higher baseline NT-proBNP have increased treatment effect with omecamtiv mecarbil; and patients with severe heart failure have increased treatment effect with omecamtiv mecarbil.
 On September 12, 2021, we announced that additional results from GALACTIC-HF assessing the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil in Black patients with HFrEF were presented in a late breaking clinical trial session at the HFSA Annual Scientific Meeting. Specifically, it was presented that of the 8,256 patients enrolled in the trial, 562 were Black (6.8%) and 285 were randomized to receive treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil. Among Black patients, treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil resulted in a trend towards reduction in the primary endpoint by 18% (HR=0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.04), corresponding to a reduction in the primary event rate of 7.7/100 patient-years with a number-needed-to-treat of 13 patients. This result, like the overall study results, was driven primarily by a reduction in HF hospitalizations (HR=0.80) and HF events (HR=0.82), with no effect on cardiovascular mortality (HR=1.03). There were no significant differences in adverse events in Black patients between the groups treated with omecamtiv mecarbil and placebo.
 METEORIC-HF: On February 15, 2022, we announced topline results from METEORIC-HF (Multicenter Exercise Tolerance Evaluation of Omecamtiv Mecarbil Related to Increased Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with HFrEF. METEORIC-HF evaluated the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (“CPET”) following 20 weeks of treatment in patients with HFrEF receiving standard of care therapy. The trial completed enrollment of 276 patients in June 2021. There was no effect on the primary endpoint, which was the change in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) on CPET from baseline to Week 20 in patients treated with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo. Adverse events, including major cardiac events, were similar between the treatment arms and the safety profile of omecamtiv mecarbil in METEORIC-HF was consistent with prior clinical trials including GALACTIC-HF.
 Omecamtiv mecarbil: New Drug Application
 On February 4, 2022, we announced that the FDA had accepted and filed our NDA for omecamtiv mecarbil for the treatment of HFrEF. The FDA assigned the NDA a standard review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date of November 30, 2022. The FDA also indicated that it was not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the NDA.

Omecamtiv mecarbil: Microgenics Immunoassay Development
 Amgen and Microgenics Corporation (“Microgenics”) are parties to that certain Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement, dated July 26, 2012 (as amended from time to time, the “Assay Agreement”), for the development of an antibody-based immunoassay (the “Microgenics OM Assay”) used for the in vitro measurement of concentrations of omecamtiv mecarbil in human blood and other bodily fluids, as well as related calibrator and controls, based on immunoassay technologies developed by Microgenics and its affiliates suitable for application on automated chemistry analyzers. The Microgenics OM Assay was intended to ensure personalized dose optimization of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients being treated. The Microgenics OM Assay was utilized in both GALACTIC-HF and METEORIC-HF to enable optimal dose titration in patients. We have been informed by Amgen that the Assay Agreement terminated contemporaneously with the termination of the Amgen Agreement. Consequently, we are pursuing the development and/or usage of alternative dosage selection tests to the Microgenics OM Assay to be used for personalized dose optimization of omecamtiv mecarbil if required by FDA or other regulatory authorities in order to obtain marketing approval of omecamtiv mecarbil.
Omecamtiv mecarbil: Ji Xing Strategic Alliance
 On December 20, 2021, we entered into License and Collaboration Agreement with Ji Xing (the “Ji Xing OM License Agreement”), pursuant to which we granted to Ji Xing an exclusive license to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in China and Taiwan. Under the terms of the Ji Xing OM License Agreement, we are the beneficiary of a nonrefundable $50.0 million payment obligation from Ji Xing comprised of a $40.0 million payment as consideration for the rights granted by us to Ji Xing and $10.0 million attributable to our having submitted to FDA a new drug application (“NDA”) for omecamtiv mecarbil. We may be eligible to receive from Ji Xing additional payments totaling up to $330.0 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestone events in connection to omecamtiv mecarbil. In addition, Ji Xing will pay us tiered royalties in the mid-teens to the low twenties range on the net sales of pharmaceutical products containing omecamtiv mecarbil in China and Taiwan, subject to certain reductions for generic competition, patent expiration and payments for licenses to third party patents. The Ji Xing OM License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue on a market-by-market basis until expiration of the relevant royalty term. 
 CK-136
 CK-136 is a novel, selective, oral, small molecule cardiac troponin activator which was discovered under our joint research program with Amgen. In preclinical models, CK-136 increases myocardial contractility by binding to cardiac troponin through an allosteric mechanism that sensitizes the cardiac sarcomere to calcium, facilitating more actin-myosin cross bridge formation during each cardiac cycle thereby resulting in increased myocardial contractility. Similar to cardiac myosin activation, preclinical research has shown that cardiac troponin activation does not change the calcium transient of cardiac myocytes. 
 CK-136: Clinical Development
 In collaboration with Cytokinetics, Amgen conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose, single-center Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CK-136 in healthy subjects. As a result of the effective termination of the Amgen Agreement on May 20, 2021, worldwide rights related to the development and commercialization of CK-136 reverted to Cytokinetics, and Cytokinetics and Amgen have entered into several agreements to facilitate the transition of the program for CK-136 to Cytokinetics.
 In 2020, we announced that preclinical data were presented at the Keystone Symposium “Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data,” demonstrating that CK-136 selectively increases calcium sensitivity of cardiac muscle fibers and increases cardiac contractility.
 On October 29, 2021 we announced that preclinical data relating to the discovery and optimization of CK-136 were presented at the 2021 Medicinal Chemistry Gordon Research Conference in West Dover, VT. The data presented described the primary research objectives related to CK-136 including the identification of initial hit compounds and subsequent chemical optimization as well as preclinical characterization in biochemical assays, cardiac myocytes, and in vivo models of cardiac function. An initial cardiac troponin activator identified in screening was shown in a reconstituted sarcomere assay to selectively activate the cardiac troponin complex. Importantly, it did not inhibit phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE-3) and showed no effect on the cardiomyocyte calcium transient, indicating its selectivity. The optimization of the initial hit compound that led to CK-136 focused to maximizing the therapeutic window and its pharmacokinetic profile as could result in favorable increases in cardiac function. Preclinical studies demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic range for CK-136 was larger than that associated with omecamtiv mecarbil in similar preclinical models. Additionally, CK-136 demonstrated a pharmacokinetic profile and a projected human half-life that should enable once or twice daily dosing. These preclinical data suggest that CK-136 is a selective cardiac troponin activator with a favorable pharmacodynamic window associated with substantial increases in cardiac contractility, representing a potential approach to augmenting cardiac contractility in diseases characterized by reduced cardiac function.

Aficamten 
 Aficamten is a novel, oral, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor that our company scientists discovered. Aficamten arose from an extensive chemical optimization program conducted with attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties that may translate into next-in-class potential in clinical development. Aficamten was purposely designed to reduce the hypercontractility that is associated with HCM. In preclinical models, aficamten reduces myocardial contractility by binding directly to cardiac myosin at a distinct and selective allosteric binding site, thereby preventing myosin from entering a force producing state. Aficamten reduces the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently reduces myocardial contractility. This mechanism of action may be therapeutically effective in conditions characterized by excessive hypercontractility, such as HCM. The preclinical pharmacokinetics of aficamten were characterized evaluated and optimized for potential rapid onset, ease of titration and rapid symptom relief in the clinical setting. The initial focus of the development program for aficamten will include an extensive characterization of its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (“PK/PD”) relationship as has been a hallmark of Cytokinetics’ industry-leading development programs in muscle pharmacology. The overall development program will assess the potential of aficamten to improve exercise capacity and relieve symptoms in patients with hyperdynamic ventricular contraction due to HCM.
Aficamten: Clinical Development
 We conducted a Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-part, single and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of CK-274 to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aficamten in healthy subjects. In September 2019 we presented data from the Phase 1 study of CK-274 at the HFSA 23rd Annual Scientific Meeting in Philadelphia. The study met its primary and secondary objectives to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of aficamten, describe the pharmacokinetics of CK-274 and its pharmacodynamic effects as measured by echocardiography, as well as to characterize the PK/PD relationship with regards to cardiac function. These data support the advancement of aficamten into a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with obstructive HCM (REDWOOD-HCM), which started in the first quarter of 2020 and will continue to be conducted in 2022.
 On January 11, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted orphan drug designation to aficamten for the treatment of symptomatic HCM.
 On May 6, 2021, we announced that the first site had been activated to enroll patients in REDWOOD-HCM OLE, an open-label extension clinical study designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of CK-274 in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM (“oHCM”). Eligible patients have completed participation in REDWOOD-HCM, the Phase 2 clinical trial of aficamten.
 On July 19, 2021, we announced positive topline results of Cohorts 1 and 2 of REDWOOD-HCM. Specifically, results from Cohorts 1 and 2 of REDWOOD-HCM demonstrated that treatment with aficamten for 10 weeks resulted in statistically significant reductions from baseline compared to placebo in the average resting left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient (“LVOT-G”) (p=0.0003, p=0.0004, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively) and the average post-Valsalva LVOT-G (p=0.001, p<0.0001, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively). The majority of patients treated with aficamten (78.6% in Cohort 1 and 92.9% in Cohort 2) achieved the target goal of treatment, defined as resting gradient <30 mmHg and post-Valsalva gradient <50 mmHg at Week 10 compared to placebo (7.7%). Reductions in LVOT-G occurred within two weeks of initiating treatment with aficamten, were maximized within two to six weeks of the start of dose titration, and were sustained until the end of treatment at 10 weeks. The observed reductions in LVOT-G were dose dependent, with patients achieving greater reductions of LVOT-G with increasing doses of aficamten. Treatment with aficamten in REDWOOD-HCM was generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment arms. No serious adverse events were attributed to aficamten and no treatment interruptions occurred on aficamten. No new cases of atrial fibrillation in patients treated with aficamten were reported. In this dose-range finding trial, one patient experienced a transient decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (“LVEF”) that required dose adjustment but not dose interruption. LVEF returned to baseline within two weeks after the end of treatment in both cohorts, which was consistent with the reversibility of LVEF decreases that were similarly observed in healthy participants in the Phase 1 study of aficamten. 
 On September 12, 2021, we announced that the primary results of REDWOOD-HCM were presented in a late breaking clinical trial session at the HFSA Annual Scientific Meeting. 
 Reductions in LVOT-G occurred within two weeks of initiating treatment with aficamten, were maximized within two to six weeks of the start of dose titration and were sustained until the end of treatment at 10 weeks. Reversibility of the pharmacodynamic effect of aficamten was seen after a two-week washout, with resting LVOT-G, post-Valsalva LVOT-G, NT-proBNP and LVEF returning to baseline values. The observed reductions in LVOT-G were dose dependent, with patients achieving greater reductions of LVOT-G with increasing doses of aficamten. Over the 10-week study period, patients treated with aficamten in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 also experienced statistically significant reductions in NT-proBNP (p=0.003). Treatment with aficamten was also associated with an improvement in heart failure functional class as measured by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Improvement by at least one class was achieved by 31% in the placebo group, 43% of patients in Cohort 1 (p>0.1) and 64% of patients in Cohort 2 (p=0.08).

On October 7, 2021, we announced the design of SEQUOIA-HCM. SEQUOIA-HCM is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate aficamten in patients with symptomatic oHCM on background medical therapy for 24 weeks. The primary objective is to assess the effect of aficamten on change in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) from baseline to week 24. Secondary objectives include change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score from baseline to week 12 and week 24, the proportion of patients with ≥1 class improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class from baseline to week 12 and week 24, change in post-Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOT-G) to week 12 and week 24, the proportion of patients with post-Valsalva LVOT-G <30 mmHg, and change in total workload during CPET to week 24. 
 SEQUOIA-HCM is open for enrollment and is expected to enroll 270 patients, randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive aficamten or placebo in addition to standard-of-care treatment. Each patient will receive up to four escalating doses of aficamten or placebo based on echocardiographic guidance alone. At screening, patients enrolled in SEQUOIA-HCM must have a resting LVOT-G ≥30 mmHg, post-Valsalva peak LVOT-G ≥50 mmHg, and be NYHA Class II or III. Patients receiving aficamten will begin with 5 mg dosed once daily. At weeks 2, 4 and 6 patients will receive an echocardiogram to determine if they will be up-titrated to escalating doses of 10, 15 or 20 mg. Dose escalation will occur only if a patient has a post-Valsalva LVOT-G ≥30 mmHg and a biplane left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥55%. Patients who do not meet escalation criteria will continue to receive their current dose or may be down-titrated if appropriate. 
 On December 9, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM.
 On February 1, 2022 we announced positive topline results from Cohort 3 of REDWOOD-HCM. Cohort 3 of REDWOOD-HCM enrolled patients with symptomatic oHCM and a resting or post-Valsalva LVOT-G of ≥50 mmHg whose background therapy included disopyramide and in the majority a beta-adrenergic blocker. All patients received up to three escalating doses of aficamten once daily (5, 10, 15 mg), titrated based on echocardiographic guidance. The doses employed were the same as those used in Cohort 1 of REDWOOD-HCM. Overall treatment duration was 10 weeks with a 4-week follow up period after the last dose. In total, thirteen patients were enrolled and all patients completed the study on treatment.
 Results from Cohort 3 showed that substantial reductions in the average resting LVOT-G as well as the post-Valsalva LVOT-G (defined as resting gradient <30 mmHg and post-Valsalva gradient <50 mmHg) were achieved. These clinically relevant decreases in pressure gradients were achieved with only modest decreases in average LVEF) there were no patients whose LVEF fell below the prespecified safety threshold of 50%. New York Heart Association functional class was improved in the majority of patients participating in Cohort 3 of the trial. Pharmacokinetic data were similar to those observed in Cohorts 1 and 2. In addition, the safety and tolerability of aficamten were consistent with prior experience in REDWOOD-HCM with no treatment interruptions and no serious adverse events attributed to treatment reported by the investigators.
 Ji Xing Strategic Alliance
 On July 14, 2020, we entered into a certain License and Collaboration Agreement with Ji Xing (the “Ji Xing Aficamten License Agreement”), pursuant to which we granted to Ji Xing an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aficamten in China and Taiwan. Under the terms of the Ji Xing Aficamten License Agreement, we received from Ji Xing an upfront payment of $25.0 million. We may be eligible to receive from Ji Xing milestone payments totaling up to $200.0 million for the achievement of certain development and commercial milestone events in connection to aficamten in the field of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or oHCM, and/or non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (“nHCM”) and other indications. In addition, Ji Xing will pay us tiered royalties in the low-to-high teens range on the net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten in China and Taiwan, subject to certain reductions for generic competition, patent expiration and payments for licenses to third party patents. The Ji Xing Aficamten License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue on a market-by-market basis until expiration of the relevant royalty term. 
 CK-271
 In 2020, we submitted an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for CK-271, a second cardiac myosin inhibitor, and we were notified by the FDA that the IND was accepted. One of the hallmarks of Cytokinetics’ research and development approach has been to advance multiple compounds to enable potential expansion of a drug development program into different indications and patient populations. On September 23, 2020, we announced that the first participants have been dosed in a Phase 1 placebo-controlled, single ascending dose clinical study of CK-271. The primary objective of this Phase 1 placebo-controlled, single ascending dose clinical study in healthy adults is to assess the safety and tolerability of CK-271. The secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of CK-271 following single oral ascending doses. The study design includes three cohorts, with 8 adults per cohort randomized (6:2) in a blinded fashion to CK-271 or placebo. Dose escalation decisions were made after review of the available safety, pharmacokinetic, and echocardiography data. In 2020, we completed our planned Phase 1, single-dose pharmacokinetic evaluation and tolerability assessments of CK-271 in healthy volunteers and determined it to be suitable for further development. We are evaluating its potential for its further development in connection with our plans to conduct a broad development program for our cardiac myosin inhibitor(s) in HCM and potentially other indications.

Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program
 Our skeletal muscle contractility program is focused on the activation of the skeletal sarcomere, the basic unit of skeletal muscle contraction. The skeletal sarcomere is a highly ordered cytoskeletal structure composed of skeletal muscle myosin, actin, and a set of regulatory proteins, which include the troponins and tropomyosin. This program leverages our expertise developed in our ongoing discovery and development of cardiac sarcomere activators, including the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil.
 We believe that our skeletal sarcomere activators may lead to new therapeutic options for diseases and medical conditions associated with neuromuscular dysfunction and potentially also conditions associated with aging and muscle weakness and wasting. The clinical effects of muscle weakness and wasting, fatigue and loss of mobility can range from decreased quality of life to, in some instances, life-threatening complications. By directly improving skeletal muscle function, a small molecule activator of the skeletal sarcomere potentially could enhance functional performance and quality of life in patients suffering from diseases or medical conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness or wasting, such as ALS, spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) or sarcopenia (general frailty associated with aging).
 Astellas Strategic Alliance 
 Our strategic alliance with Astellas to advance novel therapies for diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle impairment and weakness commenced in 2013 under the License and Collaboration Agreement, dated June 21, 2013 between the parties (the “Astellas Agreement”). Initially we exclusively licensed to Astellas rights to co-develop and potentially co-commercialize reldesemtiv and other FSTAs in non-neuromuscular indications and to develop and commercialize other novel mechanism skeletal muscle activators in all indications, subject to certain Cytokinetics’ development and commercialization rights. Subsequently, in 2014, we and Astellas expanded the strategic alliance to include certain neuromuscular indications, including SMA, for reldesemtiv and other FSTAs and to advance reldesemtiv into Phase 2 clinical development, initially in SMA. In 2016, we and Astellas further expanded the strategic alliance to include the development of reldesemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as the possible development in ALS of other FSTAs previously licensed by us to Astellas.
 On April 23, 2020, Cytokinetics and Astellas entered into two agreements, which, taken together, amend and restate our research, development and commercialization collaboration with Astellas under the Astellas Agreement, as set out below.
 Cytokinetics and Astellas signed a Fast Skeletal Regulatory Activator Agreement dated April 23, 2020 (the “Astellas FSRA Agreement”). As a result of the Astellas FSRA Agreement, Cytokinetics will now have exclusive control and responsibility for Cytokinetics’ future development and commercialization of reldesemtiv, CK-601 and other fast skeletal regulatory activator (collectively “FSRA”) compounds and products, and accordingly, Astellas agreed to terminate its license to all FSRA compounds and related products. Under the Astellas FSRA Agreement, Astellas agreed to pay one-third of the out-of-pocket clinical development costs which may be incurred in connection with Cytokinetics’ potential Phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in ALS up to a maximum contribution by Astellas of $12 million. In addition, Astellas agreed to non-cash contributions to Cytokinetics, which include the transfer of its existing inventories of active pharmaceutical ingredient of reldesemtiv and CK-601. Astellas also agreed to the continued conduct of ongoing stability studies pertaining to such existing inventories of active pharmaceutical ingredient, at Astellas’ cost. In exchange, Cytokinetics will pay Astellas a low- to mid- single digit royalty on sales of reldesemtiv in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and the European Union until the later of (i) ten years following the first commercial sale of such product in a major market country, or (ii) December 31, 2034, subject to certain royalty reduction provisions. Cytokinetics would not owe Astellas royalties on sales of reldesemtiv in any other country, or on the sale of any FSRA compounds or related products other than reldesemtiv.
 Cytokinetics and Astellas also signed the Astellas OSSA Agreement. The Astellas OSSA Agreement is an amendment and restatement of the Astellas Agreement and removes the FSRA compounds and related products from the collaboration. 
 Under the Astellas OSSA Agreement, Astellas extended the joint research program at Cytokinetics focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators (other than FSRAs) through December 31, 2020, with a minimum of fifteen (15) research FTE’s being supported by Astellas. The parties subsequently agreed to extend this joint research program through March 31, 2021, with up to five (5) research FTE’s at Cytokinetics being supported by Astellas.
 On April 27, 2021, we received written notice of termination from Astellas of the Astellas OSSA Agreement. The effective date of the termination of the Astellas OSSA Agreement was November 1, 2021.
 
16
 

Under the terms of the Astellas OSSA Agreement, Astellas received exclusive rights to co-develop and commercialize skeletal sarcomere activators (other than FSRA compounds and products) in all indications, subject to certain development and commercialization rights of Cytokinetics; Cytokinetics had the right to co-promote and conduct certain commercial activities in the U.S., Canada and/or Europe under agreed scenarios. If development candidates were identified and advanced in clinical research, the Astellas OSSA Agreement contained provisions related to shared development roles between Cytokinetics and Astellas, and opportunities for Cytokinetics to co-invest and/or co-promote under certain conditions. In the case of development candidates taken forward solely by Astellas, Cytokinetics would have received development and regulatory milestones of $25 to $35 million per product, up to $250 million for all products, except under certain scenarios, commercial milestones of up to $200 million, and royalties that ranged from a mid-single digit level to low double-digits. In the event of co-investment by Cytokinetics and approvals in certain indications, Cytokinetics would have received royalties ranging from mid-to-high double digits (not to exceed an incremental rate in the mid-twenties).
 Pursuant to the terms of the Astellas OSSA Agreement, upon the effective date of the termination, all licenses and other rights granted to Astellas under the Astellas OSSA Agreement terminated.
 Reldesemtiv
 Reldesemtiv selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Reldesemtiv has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models and evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects in humans. The FDA granted reldesemtiv orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of SMA in 2017 and for the potential treatment of ALS in 2019. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted orphan medicinal product designation to reldesemtiv for the potential treatment of SMA in July 2019 and for the potential treatment of ALS in March 2020. 
Reldesemtiv: Clinical Development 
 SMA: In 2018, we announced data from a hypothesis-generating, Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with SMA which was designed to determine potential pharmacodynamic effects of a suspension formulation of reldesemtiv following 8 weeks of oral dosing in each of two cohorts of 36 patients with Type II, Type III, or Type IV disease. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of reldesemtiv. The study showed statistically significant concentration-dependent increases in changes from baseline in Six Minute Walk Distance (“6MWD”), a sub-maximal exercise test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The study also showed statistically significant increases for Maximal Expiratory Pressure (“MEP”), a measure of strength of respiratory muscles. Other assessments, including the Hammersmith Functional Motor Score – Extended, Revised Upper Limb Module, Timed Up-and-Go, Forced Vital Capacity, and the SMA Health Index (“SMA-HI”), a patient reported outcome measure (“PROM”) developed to comply with FDA standards for PROMs, did not demonstrate differences between reldesemtiv versus placebo. Adverse events were similar between groups receiving reldesemtiv and placebo. 
 Additional results presented in 2018 showed sustained increases in 6MWD and MEP four weeks after discontinuation of study drug (i.e., follow-up). A post-hoc analysis also showed that changes from baseline in the 6MWD at 450 mg twice daily were significantly correlated with changes from baseline on certain domains of the SMA-HI intended to reflect improved endurance, especially Fatigue and Activity Participation. Decreases in SMA-HI scores reflect reduced disease burden as measured by that PROM, suggesting that as 6MWD increased, disease burden assessed by that domain of the SMA-HI was reduced.
 In 2019, we announced that we received feedback from the FDA that the 6MWD is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint for a potential registration program for reldesemtiv in patients with SMA who have maintained ambulatory function. The FDA also recommended adding a global function scale as a secondary endpoint. 
 In 2019, we announced that data from two preclinical studies of reldesemtiv showed that the addition of reldesemtiv to treatment with SMN upregulators (nusinersen and SMN-C1, an analogue to risdiplam) significantly increased muscle force in a mouse model of SMA.

ALS: In collaboration with Astellas, we conducted FORTITUDE-ALS (Functional Outcomes in a Randomized Trial of Investigational Treatment with CK-2127107 to Understand Decline in Endpoints – in ALS). This Phase 2 trial enrolled 458 eligible ALS patients who were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either 150 mg, 300 mg or 450 mg of reldesemtiv or placebo dosed orally twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of FORTITUDE-ALS was the change from baseline in the percent predicted slow vital capacity (“SVC”) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included slope of the change from baseline in the mega-score of muscle strength measured by hand held dynamometry and handgrip dynamometry in patients on reldesemtiv; change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised (“ALSFRS-R”); incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events; and plasma concentrations of reldesemtiv at the sampled time points during the study. Exploratory endpoints measured included the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on self-assessments of respiratory function made at home by the patient with help as needed by the caregiver; disease progression through quantitative measurement of speech production characteristics over time; disease progression through quantitative measurement of handwriting abilities over time; and the change from baseline in quality of life (as measured by the ALS Assessment Questionnaire-5) in patients on reldesemtiv. 
 In 2019, we announced results of FORTITUDE-ALS. FORTITUDE-ALS did not achieve statistical significance for a pre-specified dose-response relationship in its primary endpoint of change from baseline in SVC after 12 weeks of dosing (p=0.11). Similar analyses of ALSFRS-R and slope of the Muscle Strength Mega-Score yielded p-values of 0.09 and 0.31, respectively. However, patients on all dose groups of reldesemtiv declined numerically less than patients on placebo for SVC and ALSFRS-R, with larger differences emerging over time. 
 While the dose-response analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints did not achieve statistical significance at the level of 0.05, in a post-hoc analysis pooling the doses together, patients who received reldesemtiv in FORTITUDE-ALS declined less than patients who received placebo. The trial showed numerical effects favoring reldesemtiv across dose levels and timepoints with clinically meaningful magnitudes of effect observed at 12 weeks for the primary and secondary endpoints. The differences between reldesemtiv and placebo in SVC and ALSFRS-R total score observed after 12 weeks of treatment were still evident at follow-up, four weeks after the last dose of study drug.
The incidence of early treatment discontinuations, serious adverse events and clinical adverse events in FORTITUDE-ALS were similar between placebo and active treatment arms. The most common clinical adverse effects in the trial included fatigue, nausea and headache. The leading cause for early termination from FORTITUDE-ALS for patients who received placebo was progressive disease; the leading cause for early termination for patients who received reldesemtiv was a decline in cystatin C based estimated glomerular filtration rate (“eGFR”), a measure of renal function. Elevations in transaminases and declines in cystatin C eGFR were dose-related.
In 2019, post-hoc analyses from FORTITUDE-ALS were presented. The analyses demonstrated that, in the combined middle and faster progressing tertiles of patients, the decline in the ALSFRS-R total score from baseline to week 12 in patients who received any dose of reldesemtiv was significantly smaller than the decline on placebo, while no significant difference between reldesemtiv and placebo was observed in slower progressing patients. 
 In 2019, we presented subgroup analyses of FORTITUDE-ALS showing that the effect of reldesemtiv on patients with ALS was similar whether or not patients were also receiving edaravone and/or riluzole. 
 On December 14, 2020, we announced that additional post-hoc analyses from FORTITUDE-ALS evaluating how baseline patient characteristics impacted the effect of treatment with reldesemtiv versus placebo. When patients were divided into faster, middle and slower progressing tertiles based on pre-study ALSFRS-R progression rates, the middle and fastest progressing tertiles of patients combined showed a 27% difference at 12 weeks between patients receiving reldesemtiv versus placebo (1.15 ALSFRS-R points, p=0.011), compared to 18% (0.4 points; p=0.43) in the slowest progressing tertile. In general, patients with a longer symptom duration were slower progressors; 59% of those with SD >24 months were in the slowest tertile. Most patients who were minimally affected with an ALSFRS-R ≥45 at baseline were also slow progressors. In comparing the treatment effect of slow progressing patients with symptoms ≤24 months and a baseline ALSFRS-R score of ≤44 to the original primary analysis population, the effect size and statistical significance increased, despite reducing the number of analyzed patients. In an analysis of the total study population (n=458), combining all patients who received reldesemtiv and comparing to those who received placebo, the change from baseline to week 12 in the ALSFRS-R total score showed a least square mean (LSM) difference of 0.87 (p=0.013). However, limiting the analysis population to patients with symptoms ≤24 months and a baseline ALSFRS-R score of ≤44 (n=272), the LSM difference was 1.84 (p=0.0002). Together, these post-hoc analyses indicate that the impact of treatment with reldesemtiv was more apparent in patients with faster pre-study rates of progression, which include patients with short symptom duration and lower baseline ALSFRS-R scores.

Also on December 14, 2020, we announced the design of COURAGE-ALS (Clinical Outcomes Using Reldesemtiv on ALSFRS-R in a Global Evaluation in ALS), the planned Phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with ALS. COURAGE-ALS is expected to enroll approximately 555 patients with ALS.. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive 300 mg of reldesemtiv or matching placebo dosed orally twice daily for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week period in which all patients will receive 300 mg of reldesemtiv twice daily. Eligible patients will be within the first two years of their first symptom of muscle weakness, have a vital capacity of ≥65% predicted, and a screening ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised (ALSFRS-R) ≤44. Patients currently taking stable doses of Radicava® (edaravone) and/or Rilutek® (riluzole) will be permitted and randomization stratified accordingly. The primary efficacy endpoint will be change from baseline to 24 weeks in ALSFRS-R. Secondary endpoints include combined assessment of ALSFRS-R total score; time to onset of respiratory insufficiency and survival time up to week 24 using a joint rank test; change from baseline to 24 weeks for vital capacity; ALSAQ-40; and bilateral handgrip strength. Two unblinded interim analyses by the Data Monitoring Committee are planned. The first will assess for futility, 12 weeks after approximately one-third or more of the planned sample size is randomized. A second interim analysis will also assess for futility, and there will be an option for a fixed increase in total enrollment if necessary to augment the statistical power of the trial. This Phase 3 clinical trial design builds on insights gained from FORTITUDE-ALS, further exploring the hypothesis that fast skeletal muscle activation with reldesemtiv may be an important therapeutic strategy in ALS.
 On August 2, 2021, we announced that COURAGE-ALS was opened to enrollment, and enrollment is currently ongoing.
 Next Generation Fast Skeletal Muscle Troponin Activators
 In 2018, we announced the advancement of CK-601, a next-generation FSTA, into IND-enabling studies, which triggered a $2.0 million milestone payment from Astellas to us. CK-601 was designed in a joint research program conducted by the companies’ scientists to have different pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties than reldesemtiv which may inform its development for the treatment of diseases and conditions associated with both neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular etiology and pathogenesis.
Ongoing Research in Skeletal Muscle Activators 
 We are conducting translational research in preclinical models of disease and muscle function with FSTAs to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel mechanism in diseases or conditions associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction. 
Beyond Muscle Contractility
 We developed preclinical expertise in the mechanics of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle that extends from proteins to tissues to intact animal models. Our translational research in muscle contractility has enabled us to better understand the potential impact of small molecule compounds that increase skeletal or cardiac muscle contractility and to apply those findings to the further evaluation of our drug candidates in clinical populations. In addition to contractility, other major functions of muscle play a role in certain diseases that could benefit from novel mechanism treatments. Accordingly, our knowledge of muscle contractility may serve as an entry point to the discovery of novel treatments for disorders involving muscle functions other than muscle contractility. We are leveraging our current understandings of muscle biology to investigate new ways of modulating these other aspects of muscle function for other potential therapeutic applications.
Manufacturing Resources
 Our drug candidates require precise high-quality manufacturing that is compliant with good manufacturing processes (or foreign equivalent) and other applicable laws. We have no manufacturing capabilities and rely on third party sources for the supply or sourcing of raw materials, the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the manufacture and packaging of finished drug products for both clinical trial materials and commercial supply. 
 We have established relationships with leading contract manufacturers for the manufacture and supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for use in our clinical trials. Clinical trial materials sourced from contract manufacturers generally have longer lead times than commercial product, have a higher cost per unit as a result of smaller batch sizes, and may be more difficult to manufacture to necessary specifications. As a result, we endeavor to seek contract manufacturers with proven manufacturing capabilities and quality standards whom we can rely on for timely supply.
 In the event any of our drug candidates were to be approved for commercial marketing by the FDA or any other regulatory authorities, we would need to enter into contractual arrangements with contract manufacturers for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients and packaging of finished drug product for commercial use. 
 Prior to Amgen’s election to terminate the Amgen Agreement, we relied on Amgen for the supply of omecamtiv mecarbil for use in clinical trials of omecamtiv mecarbil. In furtherance to Amgen’s transition obligations arising as a result of its election to terminate the Amgen Agreement, Amgen transferred to us certain requested quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product. In January 2022, we entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement for finished drug product, and we are continuing to seek a long-term commercial supply agreement for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for omecamtiv mecarbil.

We have contract manufacturing arrangements in place with leading contract manufacturers for the development and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for aficamten and reldesemtiv for use in our clinical trials, including SEQUOIA-HCM and COURAGE-ALS.
 Intellectual Property Resources
 Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technologies, inventions and improvements that we develop that we consider important to the advancement of our business. As of December 31, 2021, we owned, co-owned or licensed 74 issued U.S. patents, over 620 issued patents in various foreign jurisdictions, and over 320 additional pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our commercial success will depend on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our drug candidates and technologies and our successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents cover them or we maintain them as trade secrets.
 With regard to our drug candidates directed to muscle biology targets, we have a U.S. patent covering omecamtiv mecarbil, U.S. patents covering our skeletal muscle sarcomere activators including, but not limited to reldesemtiv, and a U.S. patent covering aficamten, which expire in 2027, 2031 and 2039, respectively, unless extended or otherwise adjusted. We also have issued patents in various foreign jurisdictions and additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending for these drug candidates. It is not known or determinable whether other patents will issue from any of our other pending applications or what the expiration dates would be for any other patents that do issue.
 In relation to our collaborations, our partners may develop or have developed, solely or with us, intellectual property rights in connection with our drug candidates. Our collaboration agreements generally contain provisions regarding ownership, prosecution and maintenance, assignment and license rights to enable us to protect and benefit from intellectual property rights that are developed with or by our partners. For example, with respect to the Amgen Agreement, as a result of Amgen’s election to terminate the Amgen Agreement, (i) licenses granted to Amgen under Cytokinetics controlled intellectual property under the Amgen Agreement have terminated and all rights to exploit and practice such intellectual property rights have reverted to us, (ii) Amgen has transferred and assigned to us all rights in and to any trademarks specific to omecamtiv mecarbil and other compounds subject to the Amgen Agreement, (iii) Amgen has granted to us an exclusive worldwide license to Amgen-controlled patent rights relating to omecamtiv mecarbil and other compounds subject to the Amgen Agreement and (iv) Amgen has granted to us a non-exclusive worldwide license with respect to Amgen’s trade secrets that were developed or utilized by Amgen in connection with omecamtiv mecarbil and other compounds subject to the Amgen Agreement solely to develop, manufacture and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and such other compounds. 
 Our drug candidates are still in clinical development and have not yet been approved by the FDA. If any of these drug candidates are approved, then pursuant to federal law, we may apply for an extension of the U.S. patent term for one patent covering the approved drug, which could extend the term of the applicable patent by up to a maximum of five additional years.
 The degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the claim scope of these patents, our ability to enforce our existing patents and to obtain and enforce patents that may issue from any pending or future patent applications is uncertain and involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and are subject to change. To date, no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Thus, we cannot be sure that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by, co-owned by, or licensed to us. Even if patents do issue, we cannot be sure that the claims of these patents will be held valid or enforceable by a court of law, will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or will afford us a commercial advantage over competitive products. For example:
  
• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for the inventions covered by our pending patent applications or issued patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | some or all of our or our licensors’ pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or the claims that issue may be narrow in scope and not provide us with competitive advantages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
20
 

 
• | our and our licensors’ issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs or therapies or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our or our licensors’ patent applications or patents may be subject to interference, post-grant proceedings, opposition or similar legal and administrative proceedings that may result in a reduction in their scope or their loss altogether;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or drug candidates that are patentable; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the patents of others may prevent us or our partners from discovering, developing or commercializing our drug candidates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The defense and prosecution of intellectual property infringement suits, interferences, post-grant proceedings, oppositions and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly, time-consuming to pursue and divert resources. The outcome of these types of proceedings is uncertain and could significantly harm our business. For example, an unknown third party has filed an opposition against a granted European patent relating to compositions of omecamtiv mecarbil. Although we are defending the patent, we cannot be certain that the patent will be upheld as valid. If our European patent is invalidated, our intellectual property position in Europe could be weakened and it could have a negative impact on our business.
 Our ability to commercialize drugs depends on our ability to use, manufacture and sell those drugs without infringing the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist that may be relevant to the therapeutic areas and chemical compositions of our drug candidates. While we are aware of certain relevant patents and patent applications owned by third parties, there may be issued patents or pending applications of which we are not aware that could cover our drug candidates. Because patent applications are often not published immediately after filing, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which could later result in issued patents that our activities with our drug candidates could infringe.
 The development of our drug candidates and the commercialization of any resulting drugs may be impacted by patents of companies engaged in competitive programs with significantly greater resources. This could result in the expenditure of significant legal fees and management resources.
 We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are often difficult to protect, especially outside of the United States. While we believe that we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, partners and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets would be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Even if we are able to maintain our trade secrets as confidential, our competitors may independently develop information that is equivalent or similar to our trade secrets.
 We seek to protect our intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement, through which we seek to protect our intellectual property. Agreements with our employees also preclude them from bringing the proprietary information or materials of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials.
 For further details on the risks relating to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors under Item 1A of this report, including, but not limited to, the risk factors entitled “Our success depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection relating to our drug candidates and research technologies” and “If we are sued for infringing third-party intellectual property rights, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome would have a significant adverse effect on our business.”
 Compliance with Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drug candidates and drugs.
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
21
 


 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with good clinical practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of a NDA to the FDA, which must usually be accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) regulations and FDA audits of select clinical investigator sites to assess compliance with good clinical practices (“GCP”); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similar regulatory procedures generally apply in countries outside of the United States. This testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, and studies to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics in animals. The results of non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects may be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Our submission of an IND or a foreign equivalent, or those of our collaborators, may not result in authorization from the FDA or its foreign equivalent to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or its foreign equivalent for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or their foreign equivalents, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical Trials.  For purposes of an NDA or equivalent submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1: Phase 1 trials include the initial introduction of a drug candidate into humans. These studies may be conducted in patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the drug candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Phase 2 trials include the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug candidate. These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to make an initial determination of potential efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2a clinical trials generally are designed to study the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties and to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety of the drug candidate over a measured dose response range. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to conduct a Phase 2b clinical trial, which is a second, typically larger, confirmatory Phase 2 trial that could, if positive and accepted by a regulatory authority, support approval of a drug candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are then undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 trials are also intended to provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the drug labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand people, and are usually longer in duration than Phase 2 trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At any time during the conduct of a clinical trial, the FDA or a foreign equivalent can impose a clinical hold on the trial if it believes the trial is unsafe or that the protocol is clearly deficient in design in meeting its stated objectives, which requires the conduct of the trial to cease until the clinical hold is removed. In some cases, the FDA or foreign equivalent may condition approval of marketing approval for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after marketing approval, known as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 
22
 

The clinical trials we conduct for our drug candidates, both before and after approval, and the results of those trials, are generally required to be included in a clinical trials registry database that is available and accessible to the public via the internet. A failure by us to properly participate in the clinical trial database registry could subject us to significant civil monetary penalties.
 Health care providers in the United States, including research institutions from which we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and state and local privacy laws. In the European Union (the “E.U.”), these entities are subject to the Directive 95/46-EC of the European Parliament on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and individual E.U. member states implementing additional legislation. The General Data Protection Regulation (E.U.) 2016/679 is a regulation in E.U. law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the E.U. and the European Economic Area. Other countries have similar privacy legislation. We could face substantial penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider that has not satisfied the applicable privacy laws. In addition, certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our partners and may impose restrictions on the use and dissemination of individuals’ health information and use of biological samples.
 New Drug/Marketing Approval Application.  The results of drug candidate development, preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. In addition, the FDA may require that a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, also known as a REMS, be submitted as part of the NDA if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. Similar, and in some cases additional, requirements apply in foreign jurisdictions for marketing approval applications for drugs in those jurisdictions. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA often, but not always, follows the advisory committee’s recommendations. The FDA may also require preapproval inspections of manufacturing operations and clinical trial sites during the course of NDA review, and findings arising from any of these inspections may delay or prevent the approval of the NDA. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a complete response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data, including data in a pediatric population, or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval for an NDA.
 Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our partners do. Once issued, the FDA or foreign equivalent may withdraw a drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market. In addition, the FDA or its foreign counterparts may require further testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance or restrictive distribution programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA and its foreign counterparts have the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Further, if there are any modifications to a drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain prior FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, or the foreign equivalent, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Satisfaction of FDA regulations and requirements or similar regulations and requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years. The actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate or disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our drug candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages or restrictive distribution programs. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what future U.S. or foreign governmental regulations may be implemented.
 Orphan Drug Designation. Some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. 
 
23
 

An FDA orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a drug candidate that has an orphan drug designation receives the first FDA marketing approval for the indication for which the designation was granted, then the approved drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. This means that the FDA may not approve another company’s application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in certain circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the drug with orphan exclusivity or if the holder of the orphan drug designation cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the designation was granted. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 Special Protocol Assessment. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, or a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy is identified after testing has begun. An SPA does not guarantee that an NDA will be approved.
 Other Regulatory Requirements. Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals or their foreign counterparts are subject to continuing regulation by the applicable regulatory authority, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by these regulatory authorities for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA and other regulatory requirements. If our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA or its foreign counterparts may halt our or our partners’ clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug.
 For further details on the risks relating to government regulation of our business, please see the risk factors under Item 1A of this report, including, but not limited to, the risk factor entitled “The regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent our partners or us from obtaining approvals to commercialize some or all of our drug candidates.”
 Other Healthcare Laws. We are currently or will in the future be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we will conduct our business once our product candidates are approved by the FDA and commercialized in the United States. In addition to the FDA’s restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, the U.S. healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws; federal data privacy and security laws; and federal transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. Many states have similar laws and regulations that may differ from each other and federal law in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payer. In addition, state data privacy laws that protect the security of health information may differ from each other and may not be preempted by federal law. Moreover, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, report information related to drug pricing, require the registration of sales representatives, and prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Health Care Reform.  Additionally, in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed reforms of the healthcare system in an effort to contain costs, improve quality, and expand access to care. These reform initiatives may, among other things, result in modifications to the aforementioned laws and/or the implementation of new laws affecting the healthcare industry. Similarly, a significant trend in the healthcare industry is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Moreover, in the United States, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.

24
 

Coverage and Reimbursement. Our ability to commercialize any of our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and will be available from third-party payors. The principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent products will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Even if we obtain coverage for a given drug product, the associated reimbursement rate may not be adequate to cover our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses, or may require co‑payments that patients find unacceptably high. Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third‑party payors in the United States. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a product is safe, effective and medically necessary; and neither cosmetic, experimental nor investigational. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our approved products. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time‑consuming and costly. Further, coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
 Cytokinetics Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 253 employees and 114 consultants. 29 of those employees have more than 10 years tenure with us and 68 have over 5 years of service. In 2021 our turnover was 12%, which we believe is a lower attrition rate compared to the industry. 
 We are committed to fostering and maintaining a culture that engenders collaboration and teamwork, inclusion, respect, transparency and candor. Furthermore, we provide our employees with an array of professional development resources and tools to support their learning, growth and development opportunities. We were honored to be recognized as a San Francisco Times Best Place to Work in 2021.
 Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to enable us to attract and retain the best employees in a very competitive life science sector and regularly benchmark and survey the market to ensure we maintain competitive programs and ensuring employees receive equal pay for equal work. In addition, we routinely survey our employees to measure engagement, identify and take action on opportunities for improvement, and share these results with employees. 
 We have a rigorous annual goal setting and goal evaluation process under the supervision of our Board of Directors and senior management to assist our employees in understanding what is expected of them individually and as an organization.
 The company is going into its second year of implementing a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Respect program and are fully committed across all aspects of our organization including recruiting and hiring, development and promotion practices. 31% of director-level and above positions were held by ethnic or racial minorities. 43% of director-level and above positions were held by women.
 Our Compensation and Talent Committee of the Board of Directors reviews employee engagement, reward programs, human resource metrics, including attrition, retention and staffing on an on-going basis.
 COVID-19 Business Update 
 We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and continue to take proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our employees, patients, study investigators and clinical research staff, and to maintain business continuity. We believe that the measures we are implementing are appropriate and are helping to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, and we will continue to monitor and seek to comply with guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate.
 Based on guidance issued by federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work model for a vast majority of our employees effective March 16, 2020, while maintaining certain essential in-person laboratory functions in order to advance key research and development initiatives, supported by the implementation of updated onsite procedures. We have since implemented a voluntary return to work for our employees subject to precautionary measures such as mandatory temperature checks for those employees that do work on site from time to time. We are currently accommodating both our employees who wish to work onsite on a several days per week basis and those employees who wish to work entirely remotely. We expect our employees to be returning to onsite work in larger numbers over the next few months and that the vast majority will have chosen to be vaccinated against COVID-19. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and take appropriate precautionary actions in accordance with applicable laws and guidelines.
 
25
 

In the conduct of our business activities, we are also taking actions designed to protect the safety of patients and healthcare professionals. For patients already enrolled in our clinical trials, we and our partners are working closely with study investigators and clinical trial site staff to continue treatment in compliance with trial protocols and to uphold trial integrity, while working to observe government and institutional guidelines designed to safeguard the health and safety of patients and site staff.
 While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
 While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to affect our business operations, the extent of the impact on our clinical development and regulatory efforts and the value of and market for our common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the U.S. and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, our financial condition and our results of operations, see the section titled “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
