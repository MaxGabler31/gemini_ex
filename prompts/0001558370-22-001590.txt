Item 1. BUSINESS
​
Overview
​
TopBuild Corp., headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, is a leading installer and specialty distributor of insulation and other building material products to the construction industry in the United States and Canada. On July 1, 2015, we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “BLD.” 
​
Segment Overview
​
We operate in two segments: our Installation segment, which accounts for 68% of our sales, and our Specialty Distribution segment, which accounts for 32% of our sales. 
​
We believe that having both Installation and Specialty Distribution provides us with a number of distinct competitive advantages.  First, the combined buying power of our two business segments, along with our scale, strengthens our ties to the major manufacturers of insulation and other building material products.  This helps to ensure we are buying competitively and ensures the availability of supply to our local branches and distribution centers.  The overall effect is driving efficiencies through our supply chain.  Second, being a leader in both installation and specialty distribution allows us to reach a broader set of builders and contractors more effectively, regardless of their size or geographic location in the U.S. and Canada, and leverage housing and commercial construction growth wherever it occurs.  Third, during housing industry downturns, many insulation contractors who buy directly from manufacturers during industry peaks return to purchasing through specialty distributors.  As a result, this helps to reduce our exposure to cyclical swings in our business. 
​

In addition to insulation products, which represented 79% of our Installation segment’s sales during the year ended December 31, 2021, we install other building products including glass and windows, rain gutters, afterpaint products, fireproofing, garage doors, and fireplaces. 
​
We handle every stage of the installation process including material procurement supplied by leading manufacturers, project scheduling and logistics, multi-phase professional installation, and installation quality assurance. The amount of insulation installed in a new home or commercial building is regulated by various building and energy codes. 
​
Our Installation customer base includes national and regional single-family homebuilders, single-family custom builders, multi-family builders, commercial general contractors, remodelers, and individual homeowners. 
​
Through our TopBuild Home Services, Inc. subsidiary (“Home Services”) and our Environments for Living® program, we offer services and tools designed to assist builders with applying the principles of building science to new home construction. We offer pre-construction plan reviews using industry-standard home-energy analysis software, various inspection services, and diagnostic testing. Home Services is one of the top ten Home Energy Rating System Index (HERS) raters in the U.S. 
 ​
Specialty Distribution
​
We distribute building and mechanical insulation, insulation accessories and other building product materials for the residential, commercial, and industrial end markets through our Specialty Distribution business. In addition to insulation and accessories, we distribute rain gutters, fireplaces, closet shelving, and roofing materials, among other items. Insulation and insulation accessories, primarily fiberglass and spray foam, comprise approximately 82% of our Specialty Distribution sales. We have approximately 155 distribution centers across the United States and 18 branches in Canada. Our customer base consists of thousands of insulation contractors of all sizes serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial industries, gutter contractors, weatherization contractors, other contractors, dealers, metal building erectors, and modular home builders.
