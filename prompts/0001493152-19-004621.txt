ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
Formation and Background
 
The Company was incorporated in 1999 in the state of Utah under the name Datigen.com, Inc. On August 25, 2005, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Utah to Nevada by the merger of the Company with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Smart Energy Solutions, Inc., a Nevada corporation. As a result of such merger, the Company’s name was changed to Smart Energy Solutions, Inc. in order to better reflect the Company’s business operations.
 
Until November 24, 2004, the Company had been involved in various activities, including development and marketing of various internet and internet related products and services, investment in trust deed notes secured by real property, and providing concrete cutting and finishing services to persons seeking to comply with certain provisions of the American Disability Act of 1991 that require the removal of “trips hazards” from public sidewalks and ramps. On November 24, 2004, a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock was purchased by Amir Uziel and six unaffiliated individuals from certain of the Company’s shareholders, including its then Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Ollivier.
 
On March 23, 2005, the Company acquired from Purisys, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Purisys”), the intellectual property rights and certain other assets relating to a product known as the Battery Brain. The Battery Brain is a device that is attached to a motor vehicle battery for the purpose of protecting the vehicle from battery failure and theft. On such date, the Company, Purisys and Aharon Y. Levinas executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company purchased all the intellectual property relating to the Battery Brain product and the goodwill associated therewith and certain of the equipment relating to the product. The purchased assets did not include the inventory which existed as of March 23, 2005 or the molds for the Battery Brain (which were located in Italy and China), which were purchased by us for $66,487.
 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement we raised $1,500,000 in a private placement unit offering.
 
The only liabilities we assumed in connection with the acquisition of Purisys were (i) the warranties and service of any Battery Brain products sold prior to the execution and delivery of the Agreement, (ii) any potential claims made by a person who alleges that he assisted in developing the Battery Brain product and (iii) any taxes incurred as a result of the Agreement.
 
Following the purchase of the Battery Brain assets, the Company focused on building a management team, establishing operations, and entering into contractual arrangements for the manufacture and distribution of Battery Brain products.
 
The Battery Brain was manufactured on behalf of the Company by third party manufacturers. The Company had expanded its manufacturing capabilities by adding additional third party manufacturing facilities in China and Israel. The Company was also considering opportunities to expand its facilities in Italy and establish manufacturing facilities in North America. Such third party arrangements would have given the Company access to state of the art manufacturing facilities while maintaining strict protection of our proprietary property.
 
The Company had contracted with various distributors for distribution of the Battery Brain products in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Israel. The Company’s marketing activities were focused on the following nine market segments, each of which have unique requirements: Automotive Retail; Automotive Dealers; Automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers; Automotive Specialty; Fleets; Military; Heavy Truck/Bus; Motor Home/Recreational Vehicle; and Marine.
 
Since the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company’s has had no active business operations and the board decided to focus the Company’s limited resources to seek operations that would generate more revenues and positive cash flow from operations than the Corporation’s existing operations.

In connection with the order of the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey dated June 7, 2013 (the “Consent Order Approving Settlement”) the Court authorized and approved the sale, transfer and assignment of all of the Company’s assets to Aharon Levinas personally, free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances and granting Mr. Levinas effective control of the Company.
 
Based on the Consent Order Approving Settlement substantially all of the assets of the Company were transferred free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances to Mr. Aharon Levinas personally.
 
During November 2014 and March 2015, L.I.A. Pure Capital Ltd., Amir Uziel, Lavi Krasney and Attribute Ltd., acquired control of the Company by purchasing a control block of shares each holding 137,500 shares representing 88% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
Recent Corporate Developments
 
On August 30, 2017, a new wholly-owned subsidiary was registered in Israel under the name of Canna Powder Ltd. (“CannaPowder Israel” or the “Subsidiary”), with 100 common shares outstanding, 0.01 NIS par value (the “Subsidiary Shares”), all held in escrow on behalf of the Company by Israel attorney, Alon Nave. On September 27, 2017, pursuant to board resolution, the 100 Subsidiary Shares held in escrow by attorney Alon Nave were transferred to the Company.
 
On December 27, 2017, a board-resolution was adopted to issue an additional: (i) 800 Subsidiary Shares to the Company; and an additional 100 Subsidiary Shares to Rafi Ezra and, as a result, effective December 27, 2017, Canna Powder Ltd became a 90% owned subsidiary of the Company and a minority interest of 10% owned by Rafi Ezra.
 
Development of Canna Products is being conducted at the Hebrew University pursuant to the term of the Feasibility Study and Option Agreement under the supervision of the inventor of the technology, Professor Shlomo Magdassi. Products will be supplied to producers of medical cannabis products. The ability to produce a more effective, consistent product in terms of quality and composition will provide an important advantage when targeting the medical market.
 
On October 8, 2018 the Company has entered a binding memorandum of understating to finance and purchase a line of production equipment (the “Equipment”) to be used for the production of the Canna Products, as defined in the MOU, based on the specifications that will be transferred to UNV by Canna Israel. The program is currently expected to be completed within three years, with commercial sales starting in 2021. In the commercial stage, CannaPowder will establish and operate several production facilities, each located in individual territories selected according to their size and favorable regulation for medical cannabis. The Company believes that with its new facilities it will be able to produce cannabis powders at a significant cost advantage.
 
The Subsidiary’s management includes Lavi Krasney, its CEO, and Rafi Ezra, its CTO. Mr. Ezra is a highly experienced pharmacist with extensive knowledge of the cannabis sector and hands on experience of leading early stage pharma companies from early development through to commercial launch. On December 12, 2018, Mr. Krasney resigned and Oded Gilboa was appointed as the subsidiary’s CEO.
 
As a result of the new business activity, on December 11, 2017 the Company’s name was changed to CannaPowder, Inc. in order to better reflect the Company’s business operations.
