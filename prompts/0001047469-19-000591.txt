NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
   GENERAL
 We are a publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TCP. We were formed by TransCanada Corporation and its subsidiaries (TransCanada) in 1998 to acquire, own and participate in the management of energy infrastructure businesses in North America. Our pipeline systems transport natural gas in the U.S. 
 We are managed by our General Partner, which is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada. At December 31, 2018, subsidiaries of TransCanada own approximately 24 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and has two percent general partner interest in us. See Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for more information regarding TransCanada's ownership in us. 
   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS
   2017 Tax Act, 2018 FERC Actions and its impact on our business:
 In December 2016, FERC issued Docket No. PL17-1-000 requesting initial comments regarding how to address any "double recovery" resulting from FERC's current income tax allowance and rate of return policies that had been in effect since 2005. Docket No. PL17-1-000 was a direct response to United Airlines, Inc., et al. v. FERC, a decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in July 2016 in which the D.C. Circuit directed FERC to explain how a pass-through entity such as an MLP receiving a tax allowance and a return on equity derived from the discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology did not result in "double recovery" of taxes. 
 On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the 2017 Tax Act. This legislation provides for major changes to U.S. corporate federal tax law including a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent. Under the 2017 Tax Act, we continue to be a non-taxable limited partnership for federal income tax

   purposes and federal income taxes on our earnings are the responsibility of our partners. Therefore, no amounts have been recorded in the Partnership's financial statements with respect to federal income taxes as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. 
 On March 15, 2018, FERC issued the following: (1) Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) to address the treatment of income taxes for rate-making purposes for MLPs, (2) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing interstate pipelines file a one-time report to quantify the impact that the U.S. federal income tax rate reduction and the Revised Policy Statement could have on a pipeline's Return on Equity (ROE) assuming a single-issue adjustment to a pipeline's rates, and (3) a NOI seeking comment on how FERC should address changes related to accumulated deferred income taxes (ADIT) and bonus depreciation. On July 18, 2018, FERC issued (1) an Order on Rehearing of the Revised Policy Statement (Order on Rehearing) dismissing rehearing requests related to the Revised Policy Statement and (2) a final rule adopting and revising procedures from, and clarifying aspects of, the NOPR (Final Rule). On November 15, 2018, FERC issued a policy statement on the Accounting and Rate-making Treatment of Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes and Treatment Following the Sale or Retirement of an Asset (Excess ADIT Policy Statement) addressing certain issues raised in the NOI issued on March 15, 2018 (collectively, the "2018 FERC Actions"). Each of the 2018 FERC Actions is further described below. 
 FERC Revised Policy Statement on Income Tax Allowance Cost Recovery in MLP Pipeline Rates 
 The Revised Policy Statement changed FERC's long-standing policy allowing income tax amounts to be included in rates subject to cost-of-service rate regulation for pipelines owned by an MLP. The Revised Policy Statement created a presumption that entities whose earnings are not taxed through a corporation should not be permitted to recover an income tax allowance in their regulated cost-of-service rates. 
 On July 18, 2018, FERC dismissed requests for rehearing and provided clarification of the Revised Policy Statement. In this Order on Rehearing, FERC noted that an MLP is not automatically precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. Additionally, FERC provided guidance regarding ADIT for MLP pipelines and other pass through entities. FERC found that to the extent an entity's income tax allowance should be eliminated from rates, it may also eliminate its existing ADIT balance from its rate base. As a result, the Revised Policy Statement also precludes the recognition and subsequent amortization of any related regulatory assets or liabilities that might have otherwise impacted rates charged to customers as a refund or collection of excess or deficient deferred income tax assets or liabilities. 
 Final Rule on Tax Law Changes for Interstate Natural Gas Companies 
 The Final Rule established a schedule by which interstate pipelines must have either (i) filed a new uncontested rate settlement or (ii) filed a one-time report, FERC Form No. 501-G, that quantified the rate impact of the 2017 Tax Act on FERC regulated pipelines and the impact of the Revised Policy Statement on pipelines held by MLPs. Pipelines filing the one-time report had four options: 
  
Option 1: make a limited NGA Section 4 filing to reduce its rates by the reduction in its cost of service shown in its FERC Form No. 501-G. For any pipeline electing this option, FERC guaranteed a three-year moratorium on NGA Section 5 rate investigations if the pipeline's FERC Form 501-G showed the pipeline's estimated ROE as being 12 percent or less. Under the Final Rule and notwithstanding the Revised Policy Statement, a pipeline organized as an MLP is not required to eliminate its income tax allowance, but instead can reduce its rates to reflect the reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. Alternatively, the MLP pipeline can eliminate its tax allowance, along with its ADIT used for rate-making purposes. In situations where the ADIT balance is a liability, this elimination would have the effect of increasing the pipeline's rate base used for rate-making purposes; 

Option 2: commit to file either a pre-packaged uncontested rate settlement or a general Section 4 rate case if it believed that using the limited Section 4 option would not result in just and reasonable rates. If the pipeline committed to file by December 31, 2018, FERC would not initiate a Section 5 investigation of its rates prior to that date; 

Option 3: file a statement explaining its rationale for why it did not believe the pipeline's rates must change; or 

 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    9

   
Option 4: take no action. FERC would then consider whether to initiate a Section 5 investigation of any pipeline that had not submitted a limited Section 4 rate filing or committed to file a general Section 4 rate case. 

 NOI Regarding the Effect of the 2017 Tax Act on Commission-Jurisdictional Rates 
 In the NOI, FERC sought comments to determine what additional action as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, if any, was required by FERC related to the ADIT that were reserved in anticipation of being paid to the IRS, but which no longer accurately reflected the future income tax liability. The NOI also sought comments on the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated natural gas pipelines and other effects of the 2017 Tax Act on regulated cost-of-service rates or earnings. 
 As noted above, FERC's Order on Rehearing provided guidance regarding ADIT for MLP-owned pipelines, finding that if an MLP pipeline's income tax allowance is eliminated from its cost-of-service rates, then its existing ADIT balance used for rate-making purposes should also be eliminated from its cost-of-service rates. 
 As noted above, on November 15, 2018, FERC issued the Excess ADIT Policy Statement addressing certain (but not all) issues raised in this NOI. The Excess ADIT Policy Statement clarified the FERC accounts in which pipelines should record amortization of excess and/or deficient ADIT for accounting and rate-making purposes. 
 The Excess ADIT Policy Statement also addressed how to disclose reversals of ADIT account balances in FERC's annual financial report filings. The policy statement stated that, for those pipelines that continue to have an income tax allowance, excess/deficient ADIT associated with an asset that is sold or retired after December 31, 2017 must continue to be amortized in rates even after the sale or retirement of the asset. 
 Impact of the 2018 FERC Actions to the Partnership:
The 2018 FERC Actions directly addressed two components of our pipeline systems' cost-of-service based rates: the allowance for income taxes and the inclusion of ADIT in their rate base. The 2018 FERC Actions also noted that precise treatment of entities with more ambiguous ownership structures must be separately resolved on a case-by-case basis, such as those partially owned by corporations including Great Lakes, Northern Border, Iroquois and PNGTS. Additionally, any FERC-mandated rate reduction did not affect negotiated rate contracts. 
 Prior to the 2018 FERC Actions, none of the Partnership's pipeline systems had a requirement to file or adjust their rates earlier than 2022 as a result of their existing rate settlements. However, several of our pipeline systems accelerated such adjustments as a result of the 2018 FERC Actions as summarized in the table below. 
 10    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

   
 | Form 501-G Filing Option | Impact on Maximum Rates | Moratorium, Mandatory Filing Requirements and Other Considerations 
Great Lakes | Option 1; accepted by FERC | 2.0% rate reduction effective February 1, 2019 | No moratorium in effect; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by October 1, 2022 
GTN | Settlement approved by FERC on November 30, 2018 eliminated the requirement to file Form 501-G | A refund of $10 million to its firm customers in 2018; 10.0% rate reduction effective January 1, 2019; additional rate reduction of 6.6% effective January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021; These reductions will replace the 8.3% rate reduction in 2020 agreed to as part of the last settlement in 2015 | Moratorium on rate changes until December 31, 2021; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by January 1, 2022 
Northern Border | Option 1; accepted by FERC | 2.0% rate reduction effective February 1, 2019; proposed additional 2.0% rate reduction effective January 1, 2020 | No moratorium in effect; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by July 1, 2024 
Bison | Option 3 | No rate changes proposed | No moratorium or comeback provisions 
Iroquois | Option 3; subsequently reached a settlement with customers and a notice of settlement-in-principle was filed with FERC on January 9, 2019. | Expected to reduce rates by the impact of the 2017 Tax Act as shown on Form 501-G | Likely to be reaffirmed with the settlement 
PNGTS | Option 3; accepted by FERC | No rate changes | No moratorium or comeback provisions 
North Baja | Option 1; accepted by FERC | 10.8% rate reduction effective December 1, 2018 | No moratorium or comeback provisions; approximately 90% of North Baja's contracts are negotiated; 10.8% reduction is on maximum rate contracts only
Tuscarora | Option 1; subsequently reached a settlement with customers and a notice of settlement-in-principle was filed with FERC on January 29, 2019 | Expected to be finalized with the settlement | Expected to be finalized with the settlement 

  As noted above, the Final Rule that allowed pipelines owned by MLPs and other pass through entities to remove the ADIT liability from their rate bases, and thus increase the net recoverable rate base, partially or in some cases wholly mitigated the loss of the tax allowance in cost-of-service based rates. Following the elimination of the tax allowance and the ADIT liability from rate base, rate settlements and related filings of all pipelines held wholly or in part by the Partnership summarized above, the estimated impact of the tax-related changes to our revenue and cash flow is a reduction of approximately $30 million per year on an annualized basis beginning in 2019.

    Impairments
 Bison
During the fourth quarter of 2018, two of Bison's customers elected to pay out the remainder of their future contracted obligations and terminate the associated transportation agreements. The termination of these agreements resulted in a $97 million cash payment in December 2018, which was used by the Partnership, together with other cash to repay in full the balance of our $170 million Term Loan due 2020 (2015 Term Loan Facility). The $97 million was recorded in revenue, as the contract terminations released Bison from providing any future services. 
 Commercial potential opportunity exists to either reverse the direction of gas flow on Bison for deliveries on to third party pipelines ultimately connecting into the Cheyenne hub or to repurpose for liquids service. However, this development, coupled with the persistence of market conditions which have inhibited system flows on the pipeline and the uncertainty regarding Bison's ability to generate positive cash flows after the expiry of its remaining customer contracts in January 2021, led us to determine the asset's current carrying value was no longer recoverable. As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of $537 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to explore alternative transportation-related options for Bison. 
 See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates" for more information. 
 Tuscarora
In the fourth quarter of 2018, Tuscarora initiated its regulatory approach in response to the 2018 FERC Actions, resulting in a reduction in its maximum rates. In connection with its annual goodwill impairment analysis, we evaluated Tuscarora's future revenues as well as changes to other valuation assumptions responsive to Tuscarora's environment, which included estimates related to discount rate and earnings multiples. We also considered in our overall conclusion the outcome of the January 2019 settlement-in-principle reached by Tuscarora with its customers. As a result, it was determined that the fair value of Tuscarora did not exceed its carrying value, including goodwill, and the Partnership recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reduced our total consolidated goodwill balance from $130 million to $71 million. The goodwill balance related to Tuscarora at December 31, 2018 was $23 million (2017  $82 million). 
 See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates" for more information. 
   Cash Distributions to Common Units and our General Partner
 Our total quarterly cash distribution declared per common unit decreased from $3.94 per common unit for 2017 to $2.60 per common unit for 2018. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for more information. 
 On May 1, 2018, the board of directors of the General Partner declared the Partnership's first quarter 2018 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit payable on May 15, 2018 to unitholders of record as of May 9, 2018. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TransCanada as a holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to the General Partner for its effective two percent general partner interest. The General Partner did not receive any distributions in respect of its IDRs for the first quarter 2018. 
 On July 26, 2018, the board of directors of the General Partner declared the Partnership's second quarter 2018 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit payable on August 15, 2018 to unitholders of record as of August 6, 2018. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and 
 12    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

   $7 million to another subsidiary of TransCanada as a holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to the General Partner for its effective two percent general partner interest. The General Partner did not receive any distributions in respect of its IDRs for the second quarter 2018. 
 On October 22, 2018, the board of directors of the General Partner declared the Partnership's third quarter 2018 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit and payable on November 14, 2018 to unitholders of record as of November 2, 2018. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TransCanada as a holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to the General Partner for its effective two percent general partner interest. The General Partner did not receive any distributions in respect of its IDRs for the third quarter 2018. 
 On January 22, 2019, the board of directors of the General Partner declared the Partnership's fourth quarter 2018 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit which was paid on February 11, 2019 to unitholders of record as of February 1, 2019. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TransCanada as a holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to the General Partner for its two percent general partner interest. The General Partner did not receive any distributions in respect of its IDRs for the fourth quarter 2018. 
 Incentive distributions are paid to our General Partner if quarterly cash distributions on the common units exceed levels specified in the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (as amended, the Partnership Agreement). As a result of the distribution reduction noted above, the Partnership did not pay any IDRs to our General Partner on the distributions declared from the first to the fourth quarter of 2018. See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Cash Distribution Policy of the Partnership" for further information regarding the Partnership's distributions. 
   Class B Distributions
 On January 22, 2019, the board of directors of our General Partner declared its annual Class B distribution in the amount of $13 million which amount was paid on February 11, 2019. In 2018, the Class B distribution paid was $15 million. Please read Notes 8, 11, 14 and 15 within Part IV, Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" for more detailed disclosures on the Class B units. 
Other Business Developments
 Portland XPress Project update  Our Portland XPress Project or "PXP" was initiated in 2017 in order to expand deliverability on the PNGTS system down to Dracut through re-contracting and construction of incremental compression within PNGTS' existing footprint in Maine. The in-service dates of the PXP project are being phased in over a three-year period which began November 1, 2018. 
 During the second quarter of 2018, PNGTS filed the required applications with FERC for all three phases of the project, which included an amendment to its Presidential Permit and an increase in its certificated capacity through the addition of a compressor unit at its jointly owned facility with Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline LLC to bring approximately 100,000 Dth/day of additional natural gas supply to New England. On August 28, 2018 and December 3, 2018, FERC issued positive Environmental Assessments for Phases II and III of PXP, respectively. 
 PNGTS expects the capital cost of PXP to be approximately $80 million. PNGTS is currently financing this project through its $125 million credit facility established in 2018 (PNGTS Revolving Credit Facility). Concurrently with PXP, TransCanada is performing upstream capacity expansions of approximately $107 million (TransCanada PXP Expenditures), the majority of which is expected to be incurred following the receipt of required regulatory approvals prior to the end 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    13

   of Phase II. In connection with the TransCanada expansions, PNGTS signed a precedent agreement with TransCanada that contemplates the execution of a firm transportation agreement for each of the three phases of PXP, which will be assigned to TransCanada's customers at the completion of each phase. Prior to assignment of the TransCanada transportation agreements to its customers, PNGTS is obligated for the TransCanada PXP Expenditures in the event that PXP does not proceed as anticipated. At December 31, 2018, the total cost incurred by these affiliates was approximately $47 million. 
 Westbrook XPress Project  The PXP project described above is fully subscribed, with no uncontracted firm capacity available to meet incremental market demand in this region. In response to the need for incremental supply in northern New England and Atlantic Canada, PNGTS has developed a second expansion project. PNGTS' Westbrook XPress Project (Westbrook XPress) is an estimated $100 million multi-phase expansion project that is expected to generate approximately $30 million in revenue for PNGTS on an annualized basis when fully in service. It is part of a coordinated offering to transport incremental Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin natural gas supplies to the Northeast U.S. and Atlantic Canada markets through additional compression capability at an existing PNGTS facility. Westbrook XPress is designed to be phased in over a three-year period with Phase 1 and Phase 2 estimated in-service dates of November 2019 and 2021, respectively. These two Phases will add incremental capacity of approximately 43,000 Dth/day and 63,000 Dth/day, respectively. Westbrook XPress, together with Portland XPress, will increase PNGTS' capacity by approximately 70 percent from 210,000 Dth/day to approximately 350,000 Dth/day. 
 Partnership structure  On December 31, 2018, the General Partner contributed its 1.0101 percent general partner interest in each of TC PipeLines Intermediate Limited Partnership, TC Tuscarora Intermediate Limited Partnership and TC GL Intermediate Limited Partnership (together, the "Partnership ILPs") to the Partnership (the "ILP Contribution") and received a 1 percent general partner interest in the Partnership in return for the ILP Contribution, resulting in a simplification of the General Partner's effective two percent general interest in the Partnership through its directly-held one percent and indirectly-held 1.0101 percent general partner interests in the Partnership and Partnership ILPs, respectively, prior to the contribution to a directly-held two percent general partner interest in the Partnership. The transaction is being undertaken to create a more efficient partnership structure and will have no impact on the economic interests of the general or limited partners of the Partnership. This was the first step in a series of transactions to eliminate the Partnership ILPs and more closely align the Partnership to other MLP structures existing today. The Partnership now holds 100% of the Partnership ILPs' limited partner interests and general partner interests, which general partner interests are held through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, TC PipeLines Intermediate GP, LLC (the "ILP General Partner"). 
 Financing 
 PNGTS  On April 5, 2018, PNGTS entered into a revolving credit agreement under which PNGTS has the ability to borrow up to $125 million at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The credit agreement matures on April 5, 2023 and requires PNGTS to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00. The leverage ratio was 0.35 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2018. The facility is utilized primarily to fund the costs of the PXP expansion project and to finance PNGTS' other funding needs. As of December 31, 2018, $19 million was drawn on the PNGTS Revolving Credit Facility and the LIBOR-based interest rate was 3.60 percent. 
 14    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018


    North Baja  On December 19, 2018, North Baja entered into a variable rate $50 million three-year term loan payable at maturity (North Baja Term Loan). Under the terms of the agreement, the variable interest rate is based on LIBOR and North Baja is required to maintain a Total Debt to Total Capitalization ratio of not greater than 70 percent. As of December 31, 2018, $50 million was drawn on the North Baja Term Loan and the LIBOR-based interest rate was 3.54 percent. The proceeds drawn were utilized primarily to finance North Baja's general funding needs. 
 Partnership's 2015 Term Loan Facility and Senior Credit Facility  On December 31, 2018, the Partnership's 2015 Term Loan Facility was paid in full using the proceeds from Bison's contract buy-out discussed above together with the Partnership's other cash on hand. Additionally, we reduced the outstanding balance of our Senior Credit Facility by $145 million or 78 percent from $185 million at December 31, 2017 to $40 million at December 31, 2018 as part of our ongoing efforts to deleverage our balance sheet. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for more information. 
   Business Strategies
  
Our strategy is focused on generating long-term, steady and predictable distributions to our unitholders by investing in long-life critical energy infrastructure that provides reliable delivery of energy to customers. 

Our investment approach is to develop or acquire assets that provide stable cash distributions and opportunities for new capital additions, while maintaining a low-risk profile. We are opportunistic and disciplined in our approach when identifying new investments. 

Our goal is to maximize distributable cash flows over the long term through efficient utilization of our pipeline systems and appropriate business strategies, while maintaining a commitment to safe and reliable operations. 

   Understanding the Natural Gas Pipeline Business
 Natural gas pipelines move natural gas from major sources of supply or upstream pipelines to downstream pipelines or locations or markets that use natural gas to meet their energy needs. Pipeline systems include meter stations that record how much natural gas comes on to the pipeline and how much exits at the delivery locations; compressor stations that act like pumps to move the large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline; and the pipelines themselves that transport natural gas under high pressure. 
 Regulation, rates and cost recovery 
 Interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by FERC. FERC approves the construction of new pipeline facilities and regulates aspects of our business including the maximum rates that are allowed to be charged. Maximum rates are based on operating costs, which include allowances for operating and maintenance costs, income and property taxes, interest on debt, depreciation expense to recover invested capital and a return on the capital invested. During 2018, FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement and changed its long-standing policy on the treatment of income taxes for rate-making purposes for MLP-owned pipelines which has had a significant impact on MLPs in general and on their respective natural gas pipeline assets. (See also Part I within Item 1. "Business  Recent Business Developments-2017 U.S. Tax Reform, 2018 FERC Actions and its impact on our business") 
 Although FERC regulates maximum rates for services, interstate natural gas pipelines frequently face competition and therefore may choose to discount their services in order to compete. 
 Because FERC rate reviews are periodic and not annual, actual revenues and costs typically vary from those projected during a rate case. If revenues no longer provide a reasonable opportunity to recover costs, a pipeline can file with FERC for a determination of new rates, subject to any moratoriums in effect. FERC also has the authority to initiate a review to determine whether a pipeline's rates of return are just and reasonable. In some cases a settlement or agreement with the pipeline's shippers is achieved, precluding the need for FERC to conduct a rate case, which may include mutually beneficial performance incentives. A settlement is ultimately subject to FERC approval. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    15

  Contracting 
 New pipeline projects are typically supported by long-term contracts. The term of the contracts is dependent on the individual developer's appetite for risk and is a function of expected rates of return, stability and certainty of returns. Transportation contracts expire at varying times and underpin varying amounts of capacity. As existing contracts approach their expiration dates, efforts are made to extend and/or renew the contracts. If market conditions are not favorable at the time of renewal, transportation capacity may remain uncontracted, be contracted at lower rates or be contracted on a shorter-term basis. Unsold capacity may be recontracted if and when market conditions become more favorable. The ability to extend and/or renew expiring contracts and the terms of such subsequent contracts will depend upon the overall commercial environment for natural gas transportation and consumption in the region in which the pipeline is situated. 
 Business environment 
 The North American natural gas pipeline network has been developed to connect supply to market. Use and growth of this infrastructure is affected by changes in the location, relative cost of natural gas supply and changing market demand. 
 The map below shows the location of certain North American basins in relation to our pipeline systems together with those of our General Partner, TransCanada Corporation. 
 
Supply 
 Natural gas is primarily transported from producing regions and, in limited circumstances, from liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to market hubs or interconnects for distribution to natural gas consumers. The ongoing development of shale and other unconventional gas reserves has resulted in increases in overall North American natural gas production and economically recoverable reserves. 
 16    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

  There has been an increase in production from the development of shale gas reserves that are located close to traditional markets, particularly in the Northeastern U.S. This has increased the number of supply choices for natural gas consumers and has contributed to the decline of higher-cost sources of supply (such as certain offshore gas production from Atlantic Canada) resulting in changes to historical natural gas pipeline flow patterns. 
 The supply of natural gas in North America is expected to continue increasing over the next decade and over the long-term for a number of reasons, including the following: 
  
use of technology, including horizontal drilling in combination with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, is allowing companies to access unconventional resources economically. This is increasing the technically accessible resource base of existing and emerging gas basins; and 

application of these technologies to existing oil fields where further recovery of the existing resource is now possible. There is often associated natural gas discovered in the exploration and production of liquids-rich hydrocarbons (for example the Bakken oil fields), which also contributes to an increase in the overall natural gas supply for North America. 

 Other factors that can influence the overall level of natural gas supply in North America include: 
  
the price of natural gas  low prices in North America may increase demand but reduce drilling activities that in turn diminish production levels, particularly in dry natural gas fields where the extra revenue generated from the associated liquids is not available. High natural gas prices may encourage higher drilling activities but may decrease the level of demand; 

producer portfolio diversification  large producers often diversify their portfolios by developing several basins but this is influenced by actual costs to develop the resource as well as economic access to markets and cost of pipeline transportation services. Basin-on-basin competition impacts the extent and timing of a resource development that, in turn, drives changing dynamics for pipeline capacity demand; and 

regulatory and public scrutiny  changes in regulations that apply to natural gas production and consumption could impact the cost and pace of development of natural gas in North America. 

 Demand 
 The natural gas pipeline business ultimately depends on a shipper's demand for pipeline capacity and the price paid for that capacity. Demand for pipeline capacity is influenced by, among other things, supply and market competition, economic activity, weather conditions, natural gas pipeline and storage competition and the price of alternative fuels. 
 The growing supply of natural gas has resulted in relatively low natural gas prices in North America which has supported increased demand for natural gas particularly in the following areas: 
  
natural gas-fired power generation; 

petrochemical and industrial facilities; 

the production of Alberta's oil sands, although new greenfield projects that have not begun construction may be delayed in the current oil price environment; 

exports to Mexico to fuel electric power generation facilities; and 

exports from North America to global markets through a number of proposed LNG export facilities. 

 Commodity Prices 
 In general, the profitability of the natural gas pipelines business is not directly tied to commodity prices given we are a transporter of the commodity and the transportation costs are not tied to the price of natural gas. However, the cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and its price impact can have a secondary impact on our business where our shippers may choose to accelerate or delay certain projects. This can impact the timing for the demand of transportation services and/or new gas pipeline infrastructure. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    17

  Competition 
 Competition among natural gas pipelines is based primarily on transportation rates and proximity to natural gas supply areas and consuming markets. Changes in supply locations and regional demand have resulted in changes to pipeline flow dynamics. Where pipelines historically transported natural gas from one or two supply sources to their markets under long-term contracts, today many pipelines transport gas in multiple directions and under shorter contract terms. Some pipelines have even reversed their flows in order to adapt to changing sources of supply. Competition among pipelines to attract supply and new or existing markets to their systems has also increased across North America. 
Our Pipeline Systems
 We have ownership interests in eight natural gas interstate pipeline systems that are collectively designed to transport approximately 10.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from producing regions and import facilities to market hubs and consuming markets primarily in the Western, Midwestern and Eastern U.S. All our pipeline systems, except Iroquois and the PNGTS Joint Facilities, are operated by subsidiaries of TransCanada. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The PNGTS Joint Facilities (see below) are operated by M&N Operating Company, LLC (MNOC), a subsidiary of Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline LLC (MNE). MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.

  The map below shows the location of our pipeline systems. 
 
Customers, Contracting and Demand 
 Our customers are generally large utilities, LDCs, major natural gas marketers, producing companies and other interstate pipelines, including affiliates. Our pipelines generate revenue by charging rates for transporting natural gas. Natural gas transportation service is provided pursuant to long-term and short-term contracts on a firm or interruptible basis. The majority of our pipeline systems' natural gas transportation services are provided through firm service transportation contracts with a reservation or demand charge that reserves pipeline capacity, regardless of use, for the term of the contract. The revenues associated with capacity reserved under firm service transportation contracts are not subject to fluctuations caused by changing supply and demand conditions, competition or customers. Customers with interruptible service transportation agreements may utilize available capacity after firm service transportation requests are satisfied. 
 Our pipeline systems actively market their available capacity and work closely with customers, including natural gas producers, LDCs, marketers and end users, to ensure our pipelines are offering attractive services and competitive rates. Approximately 72 percent of our long-term contract revenues are with customers who have an investment grade rating or who have provided guarantees from investment grade parties. We have obtained financial assurances as permitted by FERC and our tariffs for the remaining long-term contracts. See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors." 
 Transactions with our major customers that are at least 10 percent of our consolidated revenues can be found under Note 17-Transactions with major customers within Part IV, Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules", which information is incorporated herein by reference 
 GTN  GTN's revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through the end of 2023 with its remaining contracts extending between 2024 and 2045. These contracts, which have historically been renewed on a long-term basis upon expiration, are primarily held by residential and commercial LDCs and power generators that use a diversified portfolio of transportation options to serve their long-term markets and marketers under a variety of contract terms. A small portion of our contract portfolio is contracted by industrial shippers and producers. We expect GTN to continue to 
 20    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

   be an important transportation component of these diversified portfolios. Incremental transportation opportunities are based on the difference in value between Western Canadian natural gas supplies and deliveries to Northern California. 
 During 2018, GTN benefitted from an increase in the volumes of natural gas it transports as debottlenecking activities occurred on upstream pipeline systems which deliver natural gas to GTN. These upstream activities are continuing and as a result, we have signed over 700,000 Dth/day in long-term contracts of which 348,000 Dth/day resulted in additional volumes flowing onto GTN that began mid-2018 with the remainder expected to come on-line from 2019 to 2020. The majority of these contracts have terms of at least 15 years. 
 On January 29, 2019, GTN's largest customer, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pacific Gas), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Pacific Gas accounted for approximately six percent of the Partnership's consolidated revenues in 2018. As a utility company, Pacific Gas serves residential and industrial customers in the state of California and has an ongoing obligation to serve its customers, therefore we do not expect the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas to have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations. 
 Northern Border  Northern Border is a highly competitive pipeline system and is fully contracted with its revenues substantially supported by firm transportation contracts through the end of 2020. Northern Border's contracts include renewal rights and expiring contracts have typically been renewed for terms of five years. A significant portion of Northern Border's contract portfolio is contracted by utilities, marketers and industrial load. In addition, Northern Border sells seasonal transportation services which have traditionally been strongest during peak winter months to serve heating demand and peak spring/summer months to serve electric cooling demand and storage injection. 
 Great Lakes  Great Lakes' revenue is derived from both short-haul and long-haul transportation services. The majority of its contracts are with TransCanada and affiliates on multiple paths across its system. Great Lakes' ability to sell its available and future capacity will depend on future market conditions which are impacted by a number of factors including weather, levels of natural gas in storage, the capacity of upstream and downstream pipelines and the availability and pricing of natural gas supplies. Demand for Great Lakes' services has historically been highest in the summer to fill the natural gas storage complexes in Ontario and Michigan in advance of the upcoming winter season. During the winter, Great Lakes serves peak heating requirements for customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and the upper Midwest of the U.S. 
 A significant portion of Great Lakes' total contract portfolio is contracted by its affiliates including its long-term transportation agreement with TransCanada's Canadian Mainline that commenced on November 1, 2017 for a ten-year period that allows TransCanada to transport up to 0.711 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day on the Great Lakes system. This contract, which contains volume reduction options up to full contract quantity beginning in year three, was a direct benefit from TransCanada's long-term fixed price service on its Canadian Mainline that was launched in 2017. TransCanada's long-term fixed price service provides long-term capacity to TransCanada's shippers for the transportation of WCSB natural gas to markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S. 
 During the second quarter of 2018, Great Lakes reached an agreement on the terms of new long-term transportation capacity contracts with its affiliate, ANR Pipeline Company. The contracts are for a term of 15 years from November 2021 to October 31, 2036 with a total contract value of approximately $1.3 billion on a 0.9 billion of cubic feet capacity. The contracts contain reduction options (i) at any time on or before April 1, 2019 for any reason and (ii) any time before April 2021, if TransCanada is not able to secure the required regulatory approval related to anticipated expansion projects. 
 PNGTS  PNGTS' revenues are primarily generated from transportation agreements with LDCs throughout New England. The majority of PNGTS' current revenue stream is supported by long-term contracts entered into via a series of open seasons for long-term capacity held by PNGTS in recent years. Long-term contract commitments of approximately 82,000 Dth/day from the C2C open season began December 1, 2017, necessitating an increase in PNGTS' certificated capacity up to approximately 210,000 Dth/day. The C2C contracts mature in 2032. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    21


     In addition to the C2C contracts, in 2017, as a result of its PXP open season, PNGTS executed 20-year precedent agreements with several LDCs in New England and Atlantic Canada to re-contract certain system capacity set to expire in 2019 as well as expand the PNGTS system to bring its certificated capacity up to approximately 0.3 Bcf/day by November 1, 2020. 
 PXP is proceeding concurrently with upstream capacity expansions on the TQM pipeline and TransCanada's Canadian Mainline systems. The in-service dates of PXP are being phased-in over a three-year period which began November 1, 2018. PXP, together with the C2C expansion brings additional, natural gas supply options to markets in New England and Atlantic Canada in response to the growing need for natural gas transportation capacity in the region. 
 PNGTS' recently-announced Westbrook XPress project is independent and designed to bring at least a further 106,000 Dth/day of capacity phased in over a three-year period with Phase 1 and Phase 2 estimated in-service dates of November 2019 and 2021, respectively. PNGTS held a successful open season for its Westbrook XPress project in December 2018, and has signed precedent agreements for Phases I and II of this project, pending receipt of various regulatory and corporate approvals. 
 Iroquois  Iroquois transports natural gas under long-term contracts that expire between 2019 and 2026 and extends from TransCanada's Canadian Mainline system at the U.S. border near Waddington, New York to markets in the U.S. northeast, including New York City, Long Island and Connecticut. Iroquois provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, directly or indirectly, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges throughout the northeastern U.S. Iroquois also earns discretionary transportation service revenues which can have a significant earnings impact. Discretionary transportation service revenues include short-term firm transportation service contracts with less than one-year terms as well as standard interruptible transportation service contracts. In 2018, Iroquois earned approximately 15 percent of its revenues from discretionary services. 
 North Baja  The North Baja pipeline system is an 86 mile bi-directional natural gas pipeline transporting gas between Arizona, California and the Mexican border since 2002. North Baja's historical steady financial performance is due to its strong contracting levels, having a weighted average remaining firm contract length of about 8 years. North Baja currently has a design capacity of 500 mcf/d of southbound transportation and is capable of transporting 600 mcf/d in a northbound direction. 
 Bison  As previously disclosed, natural gas is not flowing on the Bison system in response to the recent relative cost advantage of WCSB- and Bakken -sourced gas versus Rockies production. From its in-service date in 2011 and up to the fourth quarter of 2018, Bison was fully contracted on a ship-or-pay basis. During the fourth quarter of 2018, through a Permanent Capacity Release Agreement, Tenaska Marketing Ventures ("Tenaska") assumed Anadarko Energy Services Company's ("Anadarko") ship-or-pay contract obligation on Bison, which was the largest contract on Bison and comprised approximately 60 percent of Bison's revenue. After assuming the transportation obligation, Bison accepted an offer from Tenaska to buy out this contract. Following the amendment of its tariff to enable this transaction, another customer executed a similar agreement to terminate its contract on Bison. At the completion of the contracts, Bison was released from performing any future services with the two customers and as such, the amounts received were recorded in revenue in 2018. 
 These customers represent approximately 60 percent of Bison's revenue and therefore, beginning 2019 and until the remaining contracts in the system expire in January 2021, Bison will be approximately 40 percent contracted on a ship-or-pay basis and Bison's future revenue will be reduced by approximately $47 million per year in 2019 and 2020. Based on this development and other qualitative factors, the Partnership evaluated the remaining carrying value of Bison's property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2018 and concluded that the entire amount was no longer recoverable, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2018. Commercial potential exists to either reverse the direction of gas flow on Bison for deliveries on to third party pipelines ultimately connecting into the Cheyenne hub or to repurpose for liquids service. See Part I within Item 1. "Business-Recent Business 
 22    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

   Developments-Impairments and Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates" for more information. 
 Tuscarora  Tuscarora's revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through 2020 and beyond. 
 Competition 
 Overall, our pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their cash flow from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. If these long-term contracts are not renewed at their expiration, our pipeline systems face competitive pressures which influence contract renewals and rates charged for transportation services. 
 GTN and Northern Border, through their respective connections with TransCanada's Foothill systems, and Great Lakes and Iroquois, through their respective connections with TransCanada's Canadian Mainline, compete with each other for WCSB natural gas supply as well as with other pipelines, including the Alliance pipeline and the Westcoast pipeline. Northern Border and Great Lakes compete in their respective market areas for natural gas supplies from other basins as well, such as the Bakken, Rocky Mountain area, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, Utica and Marcellus basins. GTN primarily competes with pipelines supplying natural gas into California and Pacific Northwest markets. 
 Bison competes for deliveries with other pipelines that transport natural gas supplies within and away from the Rocky Mountain area, and gas from the Rocky Mountains that is delivered into the Midwest must compete with gas sourced from the Bakken and Western Canada. 
 North Baja's southbound pipeline capacity competes with deliveries of LNG received at the Costa Azul terminal in Mexico. If LNG shipments are received at Costa Azul, North Baja's northbound capacity competes with pipelines that deliver Rocky Mountain area, Permian and San Juan basin natural gas into the Southern California area. 
 Tuscarora competes for deliveries primarily into the northern Nevada natural gas market with natural gas from the Rocky Mountain area. 
 PNGTS connects with TQM at the Canadian border and shares facilities with the MNE from Westbrook, Maine to a connection with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline System near Boston, Massachusetts. PNGTS competes with LNG supplies and gas flows from Canada and with LNG delivered into Boston. Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Algonquin Gas Transmission also compete with PNGTS for gas deliveries into New England markets. 
 As noted above, Iroquois, through its connection with TransCanada's Canadian Mainline System, competes for WCSB natural gas supply with other pipelines. Iroquois connects at five locations with three interstate pipelines (Tennessee Gas, CNG Gas Transmission and Algonquin Gas Transmission) and TransCanada's Canadian Mainline System near Waddington, New York and provides a link between WCSB natural gas deliveries to markets in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. 
 Additionally, our pipeline assets face competition from other pipeline companies seeking opportunities to invest in greenfield natural gas pipeline development opportunities. This competition could result in fewer projects being available that meet our pipeline systems' investment hurdles or projects that proceed with lower overall financial returns. 
   Relationship with TransCanada
 TransCanada is the indirect parent of our General Partner and at December 31, 2018, owns, through its subsidiaries, approximately 24 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our IDRs and has a two percent general partner interest in us. TransCanada is a major energy infrastructure company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE, with more than 65 years of experience in the responsible development and reliable operation of energy infrastructure in North America. TransCanada's business is primarily focused on natural gas and liquids transmission and power generation services. TransCanada consists of investments in 57,500 miles of natural gas 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    23

   pipelines, 3,000 miles of wholly-owned liquids pipelines and 535 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. TransCanada also owns or has interests in over 6,600 megawatts of power generation. TransCanada operates most of our pipeline systems and, in some cases, contracts for pipeline capacity. 
 See also Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence" for more information on our relationship with TransCanada. 
   Government Regulation
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
 All of our pipeline systems are regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gives FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of our business, including: 
  
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce; 

rates and charges; 

terms of service and service contracts with customers, including counterparty credit support requirements; 

certification and construction of new facilities; 

extension or abandonment of service and facilities; 

accounts and records; 

depreciation and amortization policies; 

acquisition and disposition of facilities; 

initiation and discontinuation of services; and 

standards of conduct for business relations with certain affiliates. 

 Our pipeline systems' operating revenues are determined based on rate options stated in our tariffs which are approved by FERC. Tariffs specify the general terms and conditions for pipeline transportation service including the rates that may be charged. FERC, either through hearing a rate case or as a result of approving a negotiated rate settlement, approves the maximum rates permissible for transportation service on a pipeline system which are designed to recover the pipeline's cost-based investment, operating expenses and a reasonable return for its investors. Once maximum rates are set, a pipeline system is not permitted to adjust the maximum rates to reflect changes in costs or contract demand until new rates are approved by FERC. Pipelines are permitted to charge rates lower than the maximum tariff rates in order to compete. As a result, earnings and cash flows of each pipeline system depend on a number of factors including costs incurred, contracted capacity and transportation path, the volume of natural gas transported and rates charged. 
 Filings required by the Final Rule and Recent Rate Settlements 
 As noted under Recent Business Developments of this section, new rate settlements were entered into by GTN, Tuscarora and Iroquois to address the issues that came out of the 2018 FERC Actions. The terms of the rate settlements are outlined below: 
 GTN
On October 16, 2018, GTN filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the changes proposed by the 2018 FERC Actions on its rates via an amendment to its prior 2015 settlement (2018 GTN Settlement). Among the terms of the 2018 GTN Settlement, GTN agreed to a refund of approximately $10 million in 2018 to its firm customers reflective of reduced rates for the ten months ended October 31, 2018, as well as to reduce its existing maximum system rates by 10 percent effective January 1, 2019 through to December 31, 2019. The existing maximum rates will then decrease by an additional 6.6 percent for the period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. GTN is required to have new rates in effect on January 1, 2022. These reductions will replace the 8.3% percent reduction in GTN's reservation rates in 2020 agreed upon as part of GTN's last settlement in 2015. Furthermore, GTN and its customers have agreed upon a 
 24    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

  moratorium on further rate changes until December 31, 2021. The 2018 GTN Settlement will also reflect an elimination of the tax allowance previously recovered in rates along with ADIT for rate-making purposes. The uncontested settlement, which was approved by FERC on November 30, 2018, relieved GTN of its obligation to file a Form 501-G. 
 Tuscarora
On December 6, 2018, Tuscarora elected to make a limited NGA Section 4 filing to reduce its maximum rates by approximately 1.7 percent and eliminate its deferred income tax balances previously used for rate setting (Option 1). On January 29, 2019, Tuscarora notified FERC that it had reached a settlement-in-principle with its customers to address the changes proposed by the 2018 FERC Actions. Moratorium provisions and other terms such as comeback provisions are still being finalized but Tuscarora agreed to continue reducing its existing maximum system rates by 1.7 percent effective February 1, 2019 as noted in its limited NGA Section 4 filing. 
 Iroquois
On December 6, 2018, Iroquois submitted its FERC Form No. 501-G in response to the FERC Final Rule along with an explanation as to why rate changes were not required. On January 9, 2019, Iroquois notified FERC that it had reached a settlement-in-principle with its customers to address the changes proposed by the 2018 FERC Actions. Iroquois has agreed to reduce its existing maximum system rates by the impact of the 2017 Tax Act changes as shown in Iroquois' Form 501-G filed with FERC. 
 Existing Settlements with subsequent limited section 4 rate reductions 
 Great Lakes  Great Lakes operates under a settlement approved by FERC effective January 1, 2018 (2017 Great Lakes Settlement). The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement did not contain a moratorium and eliminated its revenue sharing mechanism with customers. Great Lakes is required to file new rates effective October 1, 2022. Effective February 1, 2019, FERC approved an additional 2% rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to Great Lakes' limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and mitigated the loss of Great Lakes' tax allowance. 
 Northern Border  Northern Border operates under a settlement approved by FERC effective January 1, 2018 (2017 Northern Border Settlement). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement provided for tiered rate reductions from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 that equates to an overall rate reduction of 12.5% by January 1, 2020 (10.5% by December 31, 2019 and additional 2% by January 1, 2020). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement did not contain a moratorium and Northern Border is required to file new rates effective July 1, 2024. Effective February 1, 2019, FERC approved an additional 2% rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to Northern Border's limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and mitigated the loss of Northern Border's tax allowance. Northern Border is in discussion with customers to extend the additional 2% rate reduction beyond 2019. 
 Bison  Bison operates under the rates approved by FERC in connection with Bison's initial construction and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. 
 North Baja  North Baja operates under the rates approved by FERC in its original certificate proceeding in 2001 and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. Effective December 1, 2019, FERC approved a 10.8% rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to North Baja's limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and partially mitigated the loss of North Baja's tax allowance. 
 PNGTS  PNGTS operates under the rates approved by FERC in PNGTS' most recent rate proceeding, effective December 1, 2010. PNGTS has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. 
 NOI on Certificate Policy Statement 
 FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 ("Certificate Policy Statement NOI"), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    25

  Certificate Policy Statement NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. Any proposed changes to the current policy will be prospective only and it is expected that FERC will take many months to determine whether there will be any changes to proposed natural gas pipeline projects. We do not expect changes in this policy to affect us in a materially different manner than other similarly sized natural gas pipeline companies operating in the United States. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our pipelines are subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including air emissions, biodiversity, wastewater discharges, waste management and water quality. Such laws and regulations generally require natural gas pipelines to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals required for construction and operations. Certain violations of environmental laws can result in the imposition of strict, joint and several liability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action requirements, the occurrence of delays, restrictions, or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects and/or the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting operations in affected areas. 
 The more significant of these existing environmental laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time: 
  
the Clean Air Act (CAA), which regulates air pollution on a national level by restricting the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements, and provides EPA statutory authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; 

the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States; 

the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States; 

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur; 

the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes; 

the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which governs the production, importation, use and disposal of specific chemicals and provides the EPA with authority to require reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical substances and mixtures, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, radon, and lead-based paint; 

the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories; 

the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats by the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; 

the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment; and 

 26    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018

   
the Department of Transportation regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials and emergency response preparedness. 

 Additionally, there exist regional, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. While the legal requirements imposed in state and local jurisdictions may be similar in form to federal laws and regulations, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent conditions or controls that can significantly restrict, delay or cancel the permitting, development, or expansion of a project or substantially increase the cost of doing business. Additionally, our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies. Additionally, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits, which allow private parties, including environmental organizations, to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K for further discussion on environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, including methane and other GHG emissions, ozone standards, site remediation; and other regulations relating to environmental protection. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards or more stringent enforcement programs continue to evolve. 
 We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment and, thus, any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. 
 Pipeline Safety Matters 
 Our gas pipeline systems are subject to federal pipeline safety statutes, such as the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the PSI Act), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, and Enforcement Act of 2006 (the PIPES Act), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), as well as regulations promulgated and administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. The PSI Act established mandatory inspections for all U.S. natural gas transportation pipelines in high consequence areas (HCAs), which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high population areas. The PIPES Act required mandatory inspections for certain natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and required that rulemaking be issued for, among other things, pipeline control room management. PHMSA has established a series of rules requiring pipeline operators, such as our operator, TransCanada, Iroquois and MNOC to develop and implement integrity management programs for natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs that require the performance of frequent inspections and other precautionary measures. PHMSA may assess penalties for violations of these and other requirements imposed by its regulations. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act extended PHMSA's statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, required PHMSA to complete certain outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act. 
 During 2016 PHMSA also proposed new rules and issued a Notice of Public Rule Making for natural gas transmission and gathering lines that would, if adopted, impose more stringent inspection, reporting, and integrity management requirements on operators. In 2018, PHMSA announced that it would divide the proposed new rule into three separate 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2018    27

   rulemakings, focusing on (1) maximum allowable operating pressure, integrity assessments and moderate consequence areas; (2) repair criteria, safety features for pigging, inspections and corrosion control; and (3) gathering lines. PHMSA is expected to publish the three separate rulemakings in 2019. PHMSA continues to engage industry and other stakeholders in development of these rules as well as other provisions. Any implementation of rules or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA, or any other state agencies, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis or result in a temporary or permanent reduction in maximum allowable operating pressure, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Any or all of these actions could result in a significant increase in operating costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 On July 31, 2018, PHMSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) requesting public comment on the additional safety measures pipelines facilities are required to take in response to class location changes due to population growth. The class location concept predates the extension of Integrity Management (IM) principles and it has been argued that public safety can be improved if IM measures are implemented as an alternative to pressure reductions, pipe replacements, or hydrostatic pressure testing. While this rulemaking process is expected to be lengthy, efforts to modernize the existing PHMSA regulations may have a material effect on costs. 
 The ongoing laws could cause our pipeline systems to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure their continued safe and reliable operation and to comply with the federal pipeline safety statutes and regulations. Additional rule makings regarding pipeline safety are likely and, despite compliance with applicable rules and regulations, our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures that could impact the surrounding population and environment. This may result in civil and/or criminal fines and penalties or third-party property damage claims, and could require additional testing or upgrades on the pipeline system unrelated to the incident. It is possible that these costs may not be covered by insurance or recoverable through rate increases. There can be no assurance that future compliance with the requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our pipeline systems and the Partnership's financial position, operational costs, cash flow and our ability to maintain current distribution levels to the extent the increased costs are not recoverable through rates. 
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
 Our pipelines are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The OSHA and analogous state agencies oversee the implementation of these laws and regulations. Additionally, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
 Historically, worker safety and health compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. While pipeline operators may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards, such increases in costs of compliance, and the extent to which they might be recoverable through our pipeline's rates, cannot be estimated at this time. 
 Cyber security 
 We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information pipeline operators use to safely operate our assets. We, our operators and other energy infrastructure companies in jurisdictions where we do business continue to face cyber security risks. Cyber security events could be directed against companies in the energy infrastructure industry. 
 A breach in the security of our information technology could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical information and functions. This could affect our operations, damage our assets and result in

   safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions and potential litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. 
 TransCanada, the indirect parent of our General Partner and the operator of most of our assets, has a cyber security strategy which aligns with industry and recognized standards for cyber security. This strategy includes cyber security risk assessments, preventions, continuous monitoring of networks and other information sources for threats to the organization, comprehensive incident response plans/ processes and a cyber security awareness program for employees. TransCanada also has insurance which may cover losses from physical damage to our facilities as a result of a cyber security event, but insurance does not cover all events in all circumstances. There is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against these threats will be recovered through rates. 
   EMPLOYEES
 We do not have any employees. We are managed and operated by our General Partner. Subsidiaries of TransCanada operate most of our pipelines systems pursuant to operating agreements, with the exception of the Iroquois pipeline system and the PNGTS joint facilities. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The PNGTS joint facilities are operated by MNOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MNE. MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.
