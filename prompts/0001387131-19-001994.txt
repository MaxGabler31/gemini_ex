ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

      Overview
     The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on September 19, 2013 to become a diversified Partnership serving energy companies throughout North America. We completed our initial public offering in January 2014. We currently provide essential midstream services that include independent pipeline inspection and integrity services to producers and pipeline companies and water and environmental services to U.S. onshore oil and natural gas producers and trucking companies.
     Our business is organized into three reportable segments: (1) Pipeline Inspection Services (“Pipeline Inspection”), comprising the TIR Entities’ operations, (2) Pipeline & Process Services (“Pipeline & Process Services”), made up of Brown’s operations and (3) Water and Environmental Services (“Water Services”), constituting saltwater disposal activities in our saltwater disposal entities.  Other potential lines of business outlined in U.S. Treasury Regulations and our Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) private letter ruling (“PLR”) would allow us to further diversify our business activities and lines of business serving the energy industry.
         The Pipeline Inspection segment generates revenue primarily by providing essential inspection and integrity services on a variety of infrastructure assets, including midstream pipelines, gathering systems, and distribution systems. Services include non-destructive examination, mechanical integrity, survey, data gathering, and supervision of third-party contractors. Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number of inspectors that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for those services, which depend on the type, skills, technology, equipment, and number of inspectors used on a particular project, the nature of the project, and the duration of the project. The number of inspectors engaged on projects is driven by the type of project, prevailing market rates, the age and condition of customers’ assets including pipelines, gas plants, compression stations, storage facilities, and gathering and distribution systems, including the legal and regulatory requirements relating to the inspection and maintenance of those assets. Our customers are also billed for per diem charges, mileage, and other reimbursement items. Revenue and costs in this segment may be subject to seasonal variations and interim activity may not be indicative of yearly activity, considering many of our customers develop yearly operating budgets and enter into contracts with us during the winter season for work to be performed during the remainder of the year. Additionally, inspection work throughout the United States during the winter months (especially in the northern states) may be hampered or delayed due to inclement weather, thus affecting our revenue and costs.
     The Pipeline & Process Services segment (formerly our Integrity Services segment) generates revenue primarily by providing essential midstream services including hydrostatic testing services and chemical cleaning related to newly-constructed and existing pipelines and related infrastructure. We generally charge our customers in this segment on a fixed-bid basis, depending on the size and length of the pipeline being tested, the complexity of services provided, and the utilization of our work force and equipment. Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number of field personnel that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for those services, which depend on the type and number of field personnel used on a particular project, the type of equipment used and the fees charged for the utilization of that equipment, and the nature and duration of the project.
     The Water Services segment owns and operates nine (9) Environmental Protection Agency Class II saltwater disposal facilities in the Williston Basin region of North Dakota.  Eight (8) of the facilities are wholly-owned and we have ten (10) pipelines from multiple E&P customers connected to these saltwater disposal facilities, including two (2) that were developed and are owned by the Partnership.  Approximately 94% of our disposal water is produced water that is generated during the production life of an oil and gas well and 45% of our water is delivered via pipeline to our saltwater disposal facilities. We currently serve approximately 86 customers.  Our saltwater disposal facilities provide essential midstream services to oil and natural gas upstream producers and their transportation companies. All of the saltwater disposal facilities utilize specialized equipment and remote monitoring to minimize the facilities’ downtime and increase the facilities’ efficiency for peak utilization. These facilities also utilize oil skimming and recovery processes that remove residual oil from water delivered to our saltwater disposal facilities via pipeline or truck. We sell the oil recovered from these skimming processes, which contributes to our revenues. In addition to these saltwater disposal facilities, we provide management and staffing services to a saltwater disposal facility in which we own a 25% ownership interest.

     Our Relationship with Cypress Energy Holdings, LLC
     All of the equity interests in our general partner are indirectly owned by Holdings and its affiliates. Holdings is owned by Charles C. Stephenson, Jr.; entities related to Mr. Stephenson’s family; Cynthia A. Field; a company controlled by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Peter C. Boylan III; Henry Cornell; and a company controlled by Mr. Cornell.  Holdings’ owners bring substantial industry relationships and specialized, value-creation capabilities that we believe continue to benefit us. Mr. Stephenson has over 50 years of experience as a leader in the oil and natural gas industry. He was the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vintage Petroleum prior to its sale to Occidental Petroleum in 2006 and is also the retired Chairman of Premier Natural Resources, a private oil and natural gas exploration and production company that he co-founded.  Mr. Boylan has extensive executive management experience with public and private companies and also has extensive public company directorship experience. As the owners of our general partner and the direct or indirect owners of 64.1% of our outstanding common units and all of our outstanding preferred units, Holdings and its affiliates have a strong alignment of interests with our minority unitholders to ensure the ongoing successful execution of our business plan.     Business Strategies
     Our principal business objective is to build a diversified partnership serving energy customers that will allow us, over time, to incrementally increase the quarterly cash distributions that we pay to our unitholders. We expect to achieve this objective through the following business strategies:
● | Pipeline Inspection. We believe the pipeline inspection services market offers attractive long-term growth fundamentals; as such, we intend to continue to position ourselves as a trusted provider of high-quality essential inspection services. Over the last few years, new laws have been enacted in the U.S. that, in the future, will require operators to undertake more frequent and more extensive inspections of their pipeline assets. These requirements are not tied to the current state of the oil and gas industry as a whole. Additionally, a significant portion of the pipeline infrastructure in North America was installed decades ago and is therefore more susceptible to material degradation requiring more frequent inspections. We believe that increasingly stringent U.S. federal and state laws and regulations and aging pipeline infrastructures will result in increased need for inspection and integrity services and higher demand for independent, third-party inspectors capable of navigating these complicated requirements. Most of our clients are investment–grade, well-capitalized companies that have long lead time projects that require our services regardless of the state of the current economy. Our clients also require ongoing maintenance and integrity work on their aging pipelines. Our business is not immune to changes in the energy economy; however, we believe that we can continue to grow organically by acquiring new customers and additional work from existing customers. We continue to grow our business development team to pursue these and other opportunities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pipeline & Process Services. We experienced significant improvements in our utilization rates in this segment during 2018, after a difficult two-year period during the industry downturn. Improvements were due, in part, to increasing demand and, in part, to improved business development efforts. During 2018, we opened a new office in Odessa, Texas, to better serve the growing Permian basin market. In addition, we added several industry veterans to our management team in order to further enhance our image and grow the segment. In early 2019, an affiliated entity opened a new location in the Houston market to help us take advantage of the growing work in the industry. This segment had two difficult years during the energy industry downturn, which forced us to implement aggressive measures to manage and reduce its cost structure. We believe these measures were successful, and we plan to continue to focus on the potential synergies that may develop between this segment and our other business segments. We continue to enjoy an excellent reputation in the industry and continue to bid on a substantial amount of new work. 


● | Water Services. We believe that the water and environmental services market will continue to offer long-term growth fundamentals and we intend to maintain our position as a high-quality operator of saltwater disposal facilities. We took aggressive actions in 2016 to adjust our cost structure to compensate for the lower volumes associated with the industry downturn. We continue to look for pipeline opportunities with exploration and production (“E&P”) companies that will secure water for our saltwater disposal facilities. Regulations continue to increase and we have proven to our customers that we are a trusted and dependable service provider. Increasingly, E&P companies are having their central procurement and Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) personnel conduct inspections of saltwater disposal facilities. This trend should benefit us. We remain an approved vendor for many prestigious investment grade E&P companies that demand very high standards from their vendors. Although the oil and gas industry can be cyclical in nature, our current business strategy is to derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue from existing wells. We intend to capitalize on the continued demand for removal, treatment, storage and disposal of flowback and produced water by positioning ourselves as a trusted, dependable provider of safe, high-quality water and environmental services to our energy customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         9 

    
● | Optimize existing saltwater disposal assets. The average age of our saltwater disposal facilities was 6.3 years at the end of 2018. We estimate that we utilized approximately 42% of the aggregate annual capacity (35.3 million barrels per year) of these facilities for the year ended December 31, 2018, evidencing capacity for growth without additional capital expenditures. We are seeking to increase the utilization of our existing saltwater disposal facilities by attracting new volumes from existing customers and by developing new customer relationships, including pipelines. In 2012, only one pipeline was directly connected to our saltwater disposal facilities. We currently have ten pipelines connected to four of our saltwater disposal facilities. Because many of the costs of constructing and operating a saltwater disposal facility are either upfront capital costs or fixed costs, we expect that increased utilization of our existing saltwater disposal facilities will lead to increased operating cash flow in the Water Services segment. The multi-year industry downturn placed significant pressure on both the volumes we processed and the prices we were able to charge for our services, however, the industry began a recovery following OPEC’s decision to reduce production in November 2016. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase the number of pipelines connected to our saltwater disposal facilities. As more oil and natural gas producers focus on improving operational safety and reducing liability, carbon footprint, road damage, and the total transportation cost associated with the trucking of saltwater, we anticipate that natural gas producers will increasingly prefer to utilize pipeline systems to transport their saltwater directly to saltwater disposal facilities. We continue to focus on increasing pipeline water delivered to our facilities. Our 2018 pipeline water volumes increased approximately 0.7 million barrels from piped water volumes in 2017. As a percentage of total water volume, pipeline water was 45%, 46% and 45% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We will continue to focus on potential pipeline opportunities. For example, in January 2018, we completed the construction of two pipelines that transport water from a customer’s producing fields to one of our disposal facilities. 
● | Leverage customer relationships in our business segments. We intend to pursue new strategic development opportunities with oil and natural gas producing customers that increase the utilization of our assets and lead to cross-selling opportunities between our business segments. Many customers of Water Services also own gathering systems, storage facilities, gas plants, compression stations, and other pipeline assets to which we can offer pipeline inspection and integrity services. In addition, we intend to enhance our relationships with our customers in the Pipeline Inspection segment by broadening the services we provide to our customers, including expanding our ultrasonic nondestructive examination services. By cross-selling our service offerings and adding complementary service offerings, we believe that we can further integrate into our customers’ operations and increase our profitability and distributable cash flow. 


● | Pursue strategic, accretive acquisitions. Our sponsor, Holdings, completed two acquisitions in the third quarter of 2018 that we believe will allow us to expand the breadth and depth of the pipeline integrity services we offer to our clients. Both transactions were asset purchases that require some repositioning before bringing them into the Partnership. Holdings made solid progress toward that goal on both acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2018, and intends to offer them to the Partnership once it has accomplished certain developmental goals, most likely in early 2020 (if not sooner). These acquisitions would move us into several new lines of work, including water treatment, in-line inspection (“ILI”) with next-generation high resolution technology for energy companies, equipment rental (which could be converted into a service business before offering this line of business to the Partnership), and other pipeline process services including nitrogen and dehydration. Holdings’ new Lafayette facility will also allow us to expand into the offshore market and positions us to better serve the Southeastern part of the country. The acquired ILI technology is also the first high definition tool capable of serving the municipal water industry’s aging mortar-lined steel pipelines used to transport drinking water that are in need of substantial maintenance, repair, and replacement. The future acquisitions of these businesses, when appropriate, should also position us to eventually resume increasing our distributions.

     Our Business Segments
     Our business operates in three reportable segments: (1) Pipeline Inspection Services (“Pipeline Inspection”), comprising the TIR Entities’ operations, (2) Pipeline & Process Services, made up of Brown’s operations, and (3) Water and Environmental Services (“Water Services”), consisting of saltwater disposal activities. U.S. Treasury Regulations and our IRS private letter ruling (“PLR”) allows for expansion into other lines of business. Our long-term goal continues to be diversifying the Partnership into other attractive lines of business.
        Pipeline Inspection        Overview. The Pipeline Inspection segment is a leading provider of independent inspection services to the pipeline industry. We provide essential services for pipelines, gathering systems, local distribution systems, equipment, and facilities to our well-established customer base. We provide inspection to oil and natural gas producers, public utility companies, and other pipeline operators that are required by law to inspect their gathering systems, storage facilities, infrastructure, distribution systems and pipelines. Our Pipeline Inspection service customers include oil and natural gas producers, pipeline owners and operators, and public utility companies throughout the United States. We also have entered into a joint venture with CF Inspection, a nationally-qualified woman-owned inspection firm affiliated with one of Holdings’ owners. CF Inspection serves energy companies that require the services of an approved Women's Business Enterprise. We own 49% of CF Inspection and Cynthia A. Field, a member of our board of directors and the daughter of Charles C. Stephenson, Jr., another member of our board of directors, owns the remaining 51% of CF Inspection. In 2018, CF Inspection represented approximately 3.4% of our consolidated revenue.
        Pipeline Inspection offers independent inspection services for the following facilities and equipment:
    
● | Transmission pipelines (oil, gas and liquids);
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Oil and natural gas gathering systems;
--+---------------------------------------


● | Natural gas processing plants;
--+-------------------------------


● | Pump, compressor, measurement, and regulation stations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Storage facilities and terminals; and
--+--------------------------------------


● | Gas distribution systems.
--+--------------------------

      Operations. Oil and natural gas producers, public utility companies, and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law and regulation to inspect their pipelines and gathering systems on a regular basis in order to protect the environment and ensure public safety. At the beginning of an engagement, our personnel meet with the customer to determine the scope of the project and determine related staffing needs. We then develop a customized, detailed staffing plan, utilizing our proprietary database of more than 21,000 professionals. Our inspectors have significant industry experience and are certified to meet the qualification requirements of both the customer and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). As the industry continues to adopt new technology, demand has increased for inspectors with greater technical skills and computer proficiencies. Our customers require inspectors to undergo specific training prior to performing inspection work on their projects. We utilize the National Center for Construction Education and Research and Veriforce training curricula to train and evaluate employees, along with other resources. In addition to assignment-specific training, welding inspectors and coating inspectors also must meet special certification requirements. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 we employed an average of 1,214, 1,145 and 1,147 inspectors, respectively, in the U.S. and Canada.
     Our scope of services include the following:
    
● | Project coordination (construction or maintenance coordination for in-line pipeline inspection projects);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         11

      Pipeline & Process Services
     Overview. The Pipeline & Process Services segment provides hydrostatic testing and related services to the pipeline industry, including major natural gas and petroleum companies, as well as pipeline construction companies. We focus on helping our customers meet regulatory pipeline integrity requirements. Our primary emphasis is on hydrostatic testing projects on new and existing pipelines required to maintain compliance with state and federal regulations. We perform all aspects of pipeline hydrostatic testing including filling, pressure testing, and dewatering. Unique test conditions, such as ultra-high pressure tests and pneumatic or nitrogen testing, are performed on a routine basis as well. We provide services on newly-constructed and existing natural gas and crude oil pipelines.
     Operations. Oil and natural gas producers, midstream operators, public utility companies, and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law to perform routine maintenance on their pipelines and gathering systems on a regular basis. In addition, operators and pipeline construction companies are required to integrity-test newly-constructed pipelines prior to placing the pipelines in service. In our Pipeline & Process Services segment, we contract directly with pipeline owners and with pipeline construction companies to provide testing services. We own and operate our own fill and testing equipment, including specially-designed test trailers. We use a range of fill and pressure equipment to accommodate projects of various sizes. The segment averaged 23, 20 and 23 field technicians performing the testing services during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
        12 

     Water Services
     Overview.  The Water Services segment owns and operates nine (9) Environmental Protection Agency Class II saltwater disposal facilities in the Williston Basin region of North Dakota.  Eight (8) of the facilities are wholly-owned and we have ten (10) pipelines from multiple E&P customers connected to these saltwater disposal facilities, including two (2) that were developed and are owned by the Partnership.  Approximately 94% of our disposal water is produced water that is generated during the production life of an oil and gas well and 45% of our water is delivered via pipeline to our saltwater disposal facilities. We currently serve approximately 86 customers. Our saltwater disposal facilities provide essential midstream services to oil and natural gas upstream producers and their transportation companies. All of our saltwater disposal facilities utilize specialized equipment and remote monitoring to minimize the facilities’ downtime and increase the facilities’ efficiency for peak utilization. These facilities also utilize oil skimming and recovery processes that remove residual oil from water delivered to our saltwater disposal facilities via pipeline or truck. We sell the oil recovered from these skimming processes, which contributes to our revenues. In addition to these saltwater disposal facilities, we provide management and staffing services to a saltwater disposal facility in which we own a 25% ownership interest.
     Operations.  Water Services currently generates revenue by providing the following services:
    
● | Flowback water management. We dispose of flowback water produced from hydraulic fracturing operations during the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Fracturing fluids, including a significant amount of water and proppant, are injected into the well during the completion process and are partially recovered as flowback water. E&P companies have significantly increased their volumes of completion barrels of water in various formations in order to get higher production yields when the wells are put into production. When it is removed, this flowback water contains sand, salt, chemicals, and residual oil. The oil and natural gas producer typically either transports the flowback water to one of our saltwater disposal facilities via pipeline or by truck, or contracts with a trucking company for transport. Once the water is received at the saltwater disposal facility, we treat the water through a combination of separation tanks, gun barrels, and chemical processes. The water is then injected into the saltwater disposal well at depths of at least 5,000 feet after recovering the skim oil. We also maintain the ability to store saltwater pending injection. Similar to produced water, we assess the composition of flowback water in our facilities so that we can maximize oil separation and treat the water to maximize the life of our equipment and the wellbore. We believe our approach to scientifically and methodically filtering and treating the flowback water prior to injecting it into our wells helps extend the life of our wells and furthers our reputation as an environmentally-conscious service provider.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Produced water management. We dispose of naturally-occurring water that is extracted during the oil and natural gas production process. This produced water is generated during the entire lifecycle of an oil and natural gas well. While the level of hydrocarbon production declines over the life of a well, the amount of saltwater produced may decline at a slower rate or, in some cases, may even increase. The oil and natural gas producer separates the produced water from the production stream and either transports it to one of our saltwater disposal facilities by truck or pipeline, or contracts with a trucking company to transport it to one of our saltwater disposal facilities. Once we receive the water at one of our saltwater disposal facilities, we filter and treat the water and then inject it into the saltwater disposal well at depths of at least 5,000 feet after recovering any skim oil. We also maintain the ability to store saltwater pending injection. All of our existing facilities were constructed using completion techniques consistent with current industry practices. We periodically sample, test, and assess produced water to determine its chemistry so that we can properly treat the water with the appropriate chemicals that maximize oil separation and the life of our wells. 
● | Byproduct sales. Before we inject flowback and/or produced water into a saltwater disposal well, we separate the residual oil from the saltwater stream. We then store the residual oil in our tanks and sell it to third parties. The residual oil recovery can be significant when substantial drilling and completions occur near our saltwater disposal facilities. 
● | Management of existing saltwater disposal facilities. In addition to the saltwater disposal facilities we own or lease, we own a management and development company that manages an additional saltwater disposal facility in North Dakota. Our responsibilities in managing this saltwater disposal facility typically include operations, billing, collections, insurance, maintenance, repairs and, in some cases, sales and marketing. We are compensated for the management of this facility based on a percentage of the gross revenue of the facility or a minimum monthly fee. 

      The majority of our disposed saltwater volumes are derived from produced water that is generated throughout the life of the oil or natural gas well. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, produced water represented 94%, 93%, and 96%, respectively, of our total barrels of disposed water. This differentiates us from many competitors that focus on flowback water. As a region matures and the predominant activity shifts from drilling and completion of wells to production, our facilities continue to experience demand for ongoing processing of wastewater produced over the life of the wells.
           13 

     Each of our saltwater disposal facilities is open every day of the year, with some being open by appointment only. Some of our locations include onsite offices and sleeping quarters.  We supplement our operations with various automated technologies to improve their efficiency and safety.  We have installed 24-hour digital video monitoring and recording systems at each facility.  These systems allow us to track operations and unloading activities, as well as to identify customers present at our facilities.  We believe that our commitment to operating our facilities with sophisticated technology and automation contributes to our enhanced operating margins and provides our customers with increased safety and regulatory compliance.  Our facilities have been inspected and approved by several of our public E&P customers that have stringent approval standards and field audits performed by their Environmental, Health and Safety groups.
        We have an aggregate maximum daily disposal capacity of 108,800 barrels in the following saltwater disposal facilities, all of which were built using completion techniques consistent with current industry practices and utilizing well depths of at least 5,300 feet to 6,200 feet with injection intervals beginning at least 5,000 feet beneath the surface. Our permitted capacity is much higher.

     Principal Customers
     Pipeline Inspection
     Customers of our Pipeline Inspection segment are principally oil and natural gas producers, pipeline owners and operators, and public utility or local distribution companies with infrastructure in North America. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, this segment had approximately 87, 81, and 81 customers, respectively. The five largest customers in this segment generated 51%, 53%, and 62% of our segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had two, three, and three customers, respectively, that individually accounted for more than 10% of segment revenues.     Pipeline & Process Services 
     Pipeline & Process Services segment customers are primarily pipeline construction companies and, in some instances, the pipeline owners. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, this segment had approximately 49, 51, and 56 customers, respectively. Our ten largest customers generated 78%, 74%, and 71% of our total segment revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We had two customers that each generated more than 10% of the total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.        Water Services
     Water Services segment customers are oil and natural gas E&P companies, including majors and independents, trucking companies and third-party purchasers of residual oil operating in the regions that we serve. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, this segment had approximately 86, 95, and 72 customers, respectively. Our ten largest customers generated 68%, 65%, and 65% of the Water Services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had two, one, and two customers, respectively, that individually accounted for more than 10% of segment revenues.     Competition
     Pipeline Inspection
     The pipeline inspection business is highly competitive. Pipeline Inspection’s competition consists primarily of three types of companies: independent energy inspection firms, engineering and construction firms, and diversified inspection service firms. Diversified inspection firms may inspect, for example, electric and nuclear facilities in addition to pipelines and related facilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include gaining and maintaining customer approval to service their pipelines, facilities and gathering systems, the ability to recruit and retain qualified experienced inspectors with multiple skills and non-destructive examination experience, safety record, insurance, the level of inspector training provided, reputation, dependability of services, customer service, and price.     Pipeline & Process Services
     The pipeline and process services business (hydrotesting) is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business are customer service, safety, and price. Our competition consists primarily of smaller regional integrity firms and pipeline construction companies that pipeline owners allow to test their own construction and repair work.     Water Services
     The water services business is highly competitive with relatively low barriers of entry. During 2014, our competitors opened a number of new locations around our existing facilities based upon anticipated new drilling activity prior to a downturn in the oil and gas industry that began in November 2014. Our competition consists primarily of smaller regional companies that utilize a variety of disposal methods and generally serve specific geographical markets. In addition, we face competition from other large oil field service companies that also own trucking operations and competition from our customers, who may have the option of using internal disposal methods instead of outsourcing to us or to another third-party disposal company. Many E&P companies also own their own saltwater disposal facilities and water gathering systems, and therefore do not send their produced water to third parties for disposal. We believe that the principal competitive differentiating factors in our businesses include gaining and maintaining customer approval of saltwater disposal facilities, location of facilities in relation to customer activity, reputation, safety record, reliability of service, track record of environmental and regulatory compliance, customer service, insurance coverage, and price.
        15 

     Seasonality
     Pipeline Inspection
     Inspection work varies depending upon the geographic location of our customers. The third and beginning of the fourth quarters are historically the most active for our pipeline inspection services in the United States as our customers focus on completing projects by year-end. Business has historically been slower in the period from November through March, due to the holiday season and the budgeting cycles of our customers. We believe our presence across various regions in the U.S. helps mitigate the seasonality of our business. As we expand our relationships with public utility commissions in California and other locations with moderate climates, our inspection and integrity business could become less seasonal.     Pipeline & Process Services
     Since most of the work of the Pipeline & Process Services segment is currently performed in the southern United States, weather does not create significant seasonal variations in revenue. Business has historically been slower in the period from November through March, due to the holiday season and the budgeting cycles of our customers.     Water Services
     The overall operations and financial performance of our North Dakota operations are impacted by seasonality. The volume of saltwater that we handle in the Bakken Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota tends to be lower in the winter, due to heavy snow and cold temperatures, and in the spring, due to heavy rains and muddy conditions, that may lead to road restrictions and weight limits that can impact business. The amount of residual oil is also less prevalent and more difficult to separate from the saltwater during the winter months.
        Regulation of the Industry
     Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
     Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, the discharge of materials, and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits for regulated activities; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with our operations; restrict the way we handle or dispose of wastes; limit or prohibit our or our customers’ activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas, or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our current or former operations; and impose specific standards addressing worker protections. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution.
     We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  However, these rules and regulations are constantly evolving, and amendments thereto could result in a material effect on our operations and financial position.  Further, while we may occasionally receive citations from environmental regulatory agencies for minor violations, such citations occur in the ordinary course of our business and are generally not material to our operations.  However, it is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future.  It is also possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.  Moreover, changes in environmental laws could limit our customers’ businesses or encourage our customers to handle and dispose of oil and natural gas wastes in other ways, which, in either case, could reduce the demand for our services and adversely impact our business.
        The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations and the operations of our customers are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or future cash flows.
     Hazardous substances and wastes. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historical activities or spills). These laws may also require us to conduct natural resource damage assessments and pay penalties for such damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed.
           16 

     Petroleum hydrocarbons and other substances arising from oil and natural gas-related activities have been disposed of or released on or under many of our sites. At some of our facilities, we have conducted and continue to conduct monitoring or remediation of known soil and groundwater contamination. We will continue to perform such monitoring and remediation of known contamination, including any post remediation groundwater monitoring that may be required, until the appropriate regulatory standards have been achieved. These monitoring and remediation efforts are usually overseen by state environmental regulatory agencies. 
     In the future, we may also accept for disposal solids that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource, Conservation, and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Most E&P waste is exempt from stringent regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA. None of our facilities are currently permitted to accept hazardous wastes for disposal, and we take precautions to help ensure that hazardous wastes do not enter or are not disposed of at our facilities. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. For example, in May 2016, a nonprofit environmental group filed suit in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment directing the EPA to review and reconsider the RCRA E&P waste exemption. EPA and the environmental group entered into an agreement that was formalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District court for the District of Columbia in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose a rulemaking for revisions of certain of its regulations pertaining to E&P wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised E&P waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. If the RCRA E&P waste exemption is repealed or modified, we could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
        We are required to obtain permits for the disposal of E&P waste as part of our operations. These regulations vary widely from state to state. State permits can restrict pressure, size, and location of disposal operations, impose limits on the types and amount of waste a facility may receive and the overall capacity of a waste disposal facility. States may add additional restrictions on the operations of a disposal facility when a permit is renewed or amended. As these regulations change, our permit requirements could become more stringent and may require material expenditures at our facilities or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations.
     In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, or NORM.  NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping, and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.  It is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
        Safe Drinking Water Act. Our underground injection operations are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries. In addition, storage of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process prior to sale could impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage and, as necessary, dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws.
     Our customers are subject to these same regulations. While these largely result in their needing our services, some waste regulations could have the opposite effect.  For instance, some states, have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water.  If such laws are passed, our customers may divert some saltwater to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities.
           17 

     Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, as amended, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on owners or operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. We handle oil at many of our facilities, and if a release of oil into the regulated waters occurred at one of our facilities, we could be liable for cleanup costs and damages under the OPA.
     Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act, referred to as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct activities in regulated waters and wetlands. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated waters, and permits or coverage under general permits must also be obtained to authorize discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of industrial facilities, including many of our facilities. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank spill, rupture, or leak. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
     We believe that compliance with existing permits and regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act and state counterparts will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Future changes to permits or regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act, however, could adversely affect our business.
     Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Many states also have analogous laws designed to protect endangered or threatened species.
     For example, the lesser-prairie chicken was listed as threatened in March 2014, although a district court recently vacated this decision. Additionally, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service was required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2017 fiscal year. The Fish and Wildlife Service did not meet that deadline, but continues to consider whether to list additional species under the ESA.
     Although current listings have not had a material impact on our operations, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species under the ESA or similar state laws could limit our ability to expand our operations and facilities or could force us to incur material additional costs. Moreover, listing such species under the ESA or similar state laws could indirectly, but materially, affect our business by imposing constraints on our customers’ operations, including the curtailment of new drilling or a refusal to allow a new pipeline to be constructed.
     Air emissions. Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The Clean Air Act, or CAA, and analogous state laws require permits for and impose other restrictions on facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere above certain specified quantities or in a manner that could adversely affect environmental quality. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil, and even criminal penalties. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to CAA permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities could be subject to state “minor source” air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements for air emissions. Our Pipeline & Process Services segment has certain equipment requirements in various states.
        Our customers’ operations may be subject to existing and future CAA permitting and regulatory requirements that could have a material effect on their operations. The EPA recently approved and proposed new CAA rules requiring additional emissions controls and practices for oil and natural gas production wells, including wells that are the subject of hydraulic fracturing operations. The rules also establish new emission requirements for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing and certain other equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These rules may increase the costs to our customers of developing and producing hydrocarbons, and as a result, may have an indirect and adverse effect on the amount of oilfield waste delivered to our facilities by our customers.
        18 

     Climate change. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, for example, require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was expanded in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.  Most of these cap-and-trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of GHGs.  In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consent to be bound by the agreement. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the agreement on different terms or a separately negotiated agreement. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the agreement. The agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business. The EPA and other federal and state agencies have also acted to address greenhouse gas emissions in other industries, most notably coal-fired power generation, and as a result could attempt in the future to impose additional regulations on the oil and natural gas industry.
        Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where we operate could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations, but effects could be materially adverse.
     Hydraulic fracturing . We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide treatment and disposal services with respect to the fluids used and wastes generated by our customers in such operations, which are often necessary to drill and complete new wells and maintain existing wells.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, or other proppants and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies.  Several states, including North Dakota, where we conduct our Water Services business, have either adopted or proposed laws and/or regulations to require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements.  The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases including fracfocus.org, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations.        At the federal level, the SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program and generally exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection.” The U.S. Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
     Federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process within their jurisdiction. For example, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and proposed effluent limitations for the disposal of wastewater from unconventional resources to publicly owned treatment works. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) published a rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. A U.S. District Court in Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016; that ruling was overturned and the rule instated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. The DOI formally rescinded the rule in December 2017.
     The EPA conducted a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water. The EPA released its final report in December 2016.   The study concluded that under certain limited circumstances, hydraulic fracturing activities and related disposal and fluid management activities, could adversely affect drinking water supplies. This study and other studies that may be undertaken by the EPA or other governmental authorities, depending on their results, could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.  If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing.  Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business.  Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and our cost of doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed.
        Occupational Safety and Health Act.  We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety.  OSHA’s hazard communications standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.  These laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes.  Failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil and/or criminal fines, and changes in the way we operate our facilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
           19 

     Seismic activity.   Several states have acted to address a growing concern that the underground injection of water into disposal wells has triggered seismic activity in certain areas. Any new seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells impose more stringent permitting requirements and would be likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of saltwater and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs. Additional regulatory measures designed to minimize or avoid damage to geologic formations may be imposed to address such concerns.        Employees
     The Partnership does not have any employees. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by affiliates of our general partner, although we sometimes refer to these individuals in this report as our employees.
     We are managed and operated by the directors and officers of our general partner. All of our executive management personnel are employees of CEM LLC or another affiliate of Holdings, and devote the portion of their time to managing our operations. As of December 31, 2018, 10 employees of CEM LLC provided services to us that are charged to us through the quarterly administrative fee that is specified in the omnibus agreement between the Partnership and Holdings.
     As of December 31, 2018, affiliates of Holdings employed 117 people in our corporate office, who provide various services including management, human resources, information technology, safety, and accounting, among others. We directly reimburse Holdings and its affiliates for the cost of these employees.
     Our Pipeline Inspection segment employs a number of inspectors that varies based on client needs (we generally only employ these inspectors when there is a specific client project to deploy them on). As of December 31, 2018, this segment employed approximately 1,453 inspectors. Of these inspectors, 5 were employed in Canada and the remainder were employed in the United States. We directly reimburse Holdings and its affiliates for the cost of these inspectors.
     Our Pipeline & Process Services segment employed approximately 42 people at December 31, 2018. Most of the employees in the Pipeline & Process Services segment are full-time employees who are compensated regardless of whether or not they are deployed on a client project. We directly reimburse Holdings and its affiliates for the cost of these employees.
        Our Water Services segment employed 10 people at December 31, 2018, all of whom work at our North Dakota facilities. We directly reimburse Holdings and its affiliates for the cost of these employees.
        As of December 31, 2018, approximately 125 inspectors of our Pipeline Inspection segment are members of a union and are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. None of our other employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
     Insurance Matters
     Our customers require that we maintain certain minimum levels of insurance and evaluate our insurance coverage as part of the initial and ongoing approval process they require to use our services to treat and dispose of their waste. We also carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations as required by law. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses, and losses not covered by insurance would increase our costs. Also, insurance rates have been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost, or higher deductibles and retentions.
     The saltwater disposal and the pipeline inspection and integrity businesses can be dangerous, involving unforeseen circumstances such as environmental damage from leaks, spills, or vehicle accidents. To address the hazards inherent in Water Services, our insurance coverage includes business, auto liability, commercial general liability, employer’s liability, environmental and pollution, and other coverage. To address the hazards inherent in Pipeline Inspection and Pipeline & Process Services, insurance coverage includes employer’s liability, auto liability, employee benefits liabilities, and contractor’s pollution and other coverage. Coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations and are commonly provided for exclusion on such policies. We do not carry business interruption insurance, given its cost and its coverage limitations.
