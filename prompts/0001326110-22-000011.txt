Our Business
ImmunityBio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that complement, harness, and amplify the immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. We strive to be a vertically-integrated immunotherapy company designing and manufacturing our products so they are more effective, accessible, more conveniently stored, and more easily administered to patients. 
Our broad immunotherapy and cell therapy platforms are designed to attack cancer and infectious pathogens by activating both the innate immune system—natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages—and the adaptive immune system—B cells and T cells—in an orchestrated manner. The goal of this potentially best-in-class approach is to generate immunogenic cell death thereby eliminating rogue cells from the body whether they are cancerous or virally infected. Our ultimate goal is to employ this approach to establish an “immunological memory” that confers long-term benefit for the patient.
Our business is based on the foundation of multiple platforms that collectively act on the entire immune response with the goal of targeted, durable, coordinated, and safe immunity against disease. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to overcome the limitations of the current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases, such as checkpoint inhibitors and antiretroviral therapies. We have established one of the most comprehensive portfolios of immunotherapy and vaccine platforms, which include:
We believe that our innovative approach to orchestrate and combine therapies for optimal immune system response will become a therapeutic foundation across multiple clinical indications. Although such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval, Anktiva, our novel antibody cytokine fusion protein, has received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations in combination with BCG from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS. Based on the reported results of the trial, we have initiated discussions with the FDA to file a BLA for Anktiva (to be branded VesAnktiva™ for intravesical administration) plus BCG for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS. Additionally, we believe data from multiple clinical trials indicates Anktiva has broad potential to enhance the activity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Keytruda®), across a wide range of tumor types. 
Table of Contents

Our platforms, which include 17 first-in-human therapeutic agents, are being studied in 26 actively recruiting clinical trials—17 of which are in Phase 2 or 3 development—across 13 indications in liquid and solid tumors, including bladder, pancreatic and lung cancers. These are among the most frequent and lethal cancer types for which there are high failure rates for existing standards of care or, in some cases, no available effective treatment. In infectious disease, our pipeline currently targets such pathogens as the novel strain of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We believe SARS-CoV-2 currently lacks a vaccine that provides long-term protection against the virus, particularly its variants, while HIV affects tens of millions of people globally and currently has no known cure.
We have established Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell manufacturing expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as well as extensive and seasoned research and development (R&D), clinical trial, and regulatory operations and development teams.
Our Strategy
We seek to become the leading global immunological therapeutics company by creating the next generation of immunotherapies to address serious unmet needs within oncology and infectious diseases. To achieve this goal, the key elements of our strategy include: 
•advancing the approval and commercialization of our lead antibody cytokine fusion protein, Anktiva, as an integral component of immunotherapy combinations, including those with checkpoint inhibitors;
•continuously scrutinizing our clinical pipeline and assessing our strategic priorities to maximize opportunities for regulatory approval and to meet unmet medical needs;
•accelerating our immunotherapy platform and product candidates with registrational intent to address difficult-to-treat oncological and infectious disease indications;
•continuing to prospect, license, and acquire technologies to complement and strengthen our platforms and product candidates, both as single agent and combination therapies, in order to activate and coordinate the innate and adaptive immune system to generate cellular memory against multiple tumor types and infectious diseases;
•optimizing investment in our discovery, development, and manufacturing capabilities for our next-generation targeted antibody cytokine fusion proteins and vaccine candidates, as well as for cell therapies;
•advancing our formulations and delivery mechanisms to make our promising biotechnology product candidates available to the broadest population possible; and
•cultivating new and expanding existing collaborations for our multi-stage pipeline to efficiently scale globally.

Our Next-Generation Platforms
1.Antibody Cytokine Fusion Proteins
Antibody cytokine fusion proteins such as Anktiva are a novel class of biopharmaceuticals that enhance the therapeutic potential of cytokines, and promote lymphocyte infiltration at a site of disease, improving immune response. Anktiva (N-803) is a novel interleukin-15 (IL-15) superagonist fusion protein consisting of high-affinity mutant IL-15N72D fused to the IL-15 receptor α sushi subunit and linked to the Fc portion of IgG1 Fc. The novel antibody cytokine fusion protein specifically increases the activity of two critical aspects of the immune system—NK cells and cytotoxic (tumor cell killing) CD8 T-cells—and exerts its effects via beta gamma, rather than alpha, T-cell receptor binding and avoids regulatory T-cell (T-reg) stimulation that might dampen the pro-immune effect. Anktiva has improved pharmacokinetic properties, longer persistence in lymphoid tissues and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to native, non-complexed IL-15 in vivo. Multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in both liquid and solid tumors have been completed through the date of this Annual Report in over 700 patients. Although such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval, Anktiva has been awarded both Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS as well as Fast Track designation for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC papillary and BCG-naïve NMIBC CIS. Based on patient data that was submitted with our application to obtain the Breakthrough Therapy designation in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS, Anktiva achieved its primary endpoint of a complete response (CR) rate at any time in the ongoing registrational Phase 2/3 trial. We believe that other indications with registration potential include BCG unresponsive papillary bladder cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We have initiated discussions with the FDA to file a BLA for Anktiva (to be branded VesAnktiva for intravesical administration) plus BCG for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS. 
In addition to Anktiva, we are developing bi-specific fusion proteins targeting CD20, PD-L1, IL-12, and TGF-ß to further enhance NK and T-cell activation directed to the infectious disease or tumor microenvironment, and to modulate the systemic and local immune response to accelerate immunogenic cell death. Prioritized product candidates in preclinical development include antibody cytokine fusion proteins N-820 (targeting CD20), N-809 (targeting PD-L1), N-812 (delivering IL-12 to necrotic tumor cells), and N-830 (delivering a TGF-ß Trap to necrotic tumor cells).

2.DNA, RNA, and Recombinant Protein Vaccine Technologies
We have developed and acquired rights to multiple vaccine delivery technologies for infectious diseases to target key viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and for oncology to deliver common tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and neoepitopes (expressed only by cancer cells). These technologies can deliver DNA, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), and subunit proteins to induce B and T cell memory due to the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells along with antibody (humoral) responses. We believe a “mix-and-match” strategy (i.e., a heterologous approach combining different vaccine platforms) could provide maximal immune protection against current and future COVID-19 variants such as Delta and Omicron. Our key vaccine delivery technologies include:
a.Self-amplifying RNA 
Synthetic RNA technology has quickly emerged for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines in part because it allows for rapid, scalable, and cell-free manufacturing as evidenced by the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines. We believe our saRNA technology (licensed from the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) both directly and, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, through our joint venture formed with Amyris, Inc. (Amyris) in December 2021) represents a significant improvement over existing RNA technologies. Our saRNA constructs include a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formulation important for thermal stability and facilitating the substitution of genetic sequences and have demonstrated an ability to vaccinate with multi-valent strains. The self-replicating capability allows for increased potency by maintaining auto-replicative activity derived from the RNA virus vector, while the self-amplifying capability may increase the duration and breadth of immunity. Preclinical studies in small animal and non-human primate (NHP) models have shown that the saRNA delivery vehicle results in potent humoral and cell-based immunogenicity. Phase 1 first-in-human trials of saRNA for COVID-19 are anticipated to begin in the first half of 2022.

b.Second-generation adenovirus hAd5 vector
Adenovirus is a well-established viral vector and can be utilized as a vaccine to stimulate the immune system. Our human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) technology has unique deletions in the early 1, (E1), early 2 (E2b) and early 3 (E3) regions (hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-]), which allows it to be effective in the presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity and lowers the risk of generating de novo vector-directed immunity. We have several hAd5 product candidates, which have been studied in multiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials as potential vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and certain cancers. Importantly, these product candidates have shown an ability to overcome previous adenovirus immunity in cancer patients and in preclinical models. The hAd5 technology has also been used with common TAAs to establish memory T cells in multiple clinical trials. Our SARS-CoV-2 candidate uses a combination of S-Fusion and N-ETSD, our novel constructs of COVID-19 S+N proteins, which has been shown to generate CD4+ and CD8+ T cell mediated immunity and neutralizing antibodies in Phase 1 trials. Our vaccine candidate is currently being studied in our SISONKE Boost Trial (COVID 4.010) in South Africa now in Phase 3.
c.Recombinant subunit proteins
Our yeast vaccine platforms have been studied in both oncology and infectious disease. The Tarmogen platform (licensed from our subsidiary GlobeImmune, Inc. (GlobeImmune)) has been administered to over 400 patients with cancer or infectious diseases in FDA-regulated clinical trials. This platform technology consists of a heat-killed, recombinant S cerevisiae yeast-based vaccine engineered to express immunogens such as TAAs, pathogen antigens, and tumor-specific neoepitopes. Immunization with this platform elicits CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses capable of eliminating tumor cells or pathogen-infected cells. Our recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) pichia-based antigen (licensed from the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), which was developed at the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development) with 3M-052/Alum adjuvants and related technology (licensed from IDRI and 3M Company (3M) and affiliates) has been shown to provide protection against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 (and variants of concern), and animal coronaviruses. Phase 1 clinical trials of this subunit protein and 3M-052 adjuvants are anticipated to begin in the first half of 2022.
d.Bacterial-based endosomal delivery vectors
EDVs are a first-in-class, cyto-immunotherapy platform that utilizes antibody-targeted, bacterially-derived, 400 nm diameter non-living “nanocells” to release high concentrations of super-cytotoxic drugs, molecularly-targeted drugs, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)/microRNAs (miRNAs) and can be engineered to activate iNKT cells (see below—Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT)). We signed a binding term sheet with EnGeneIC Pty Limited (EnGeneIC) to integrate their patented EDV to explore clinical development in the treatment of COVID-19 and pancreatic cancer. 
3.Toll-Like Receptor Activating Adjuvants
Adjuvants are either synthetic or naturally occurring molecules that activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) thereby enhancing the humoral and cell-mediated immune response of vaccines. There are 10 human TLRs expressed either on the inside or outside of the immune cell and their function is to recognize foreign substances expressed by pathogens. Once activated, these TLRs stimulate danger signals to the immune cells initiating an immune response. We have licensed adjuvants and related technology from IDRI and 3M Company and its affiliates to incorporate with the vaccine delivery platforms described above and have access to multiple toll receptor activators, including TLR 4, TLR 7, and TLR 8. The 3M-052/Alum adjuvant formulation is in Phase 1 trials in the U.S. with an HIV antigen and has been well-tolerated and highly immunogenic. A Phase 1 clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 of this 3M-052 adjuvant in combination with a subunit protein is anticipated to begin in the first half of 2022. We also plan to use these adjuvants in vaccines for the treatment of tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and influenza.

4.NK Cell Therapy
ImmunityBio has one of the most comprehensive clinical-stage natural killer cell platforms, which has demonstrated the ability to induce cell death in cancers and virally-infected cells through a variety of concurrent mechanisms including innate killing, antibody-mediated killing, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-directed killing, and a combination of both antibody-mediated and CAR-directed killing. 
a.Off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cells
Natural killer cells (NK cells) are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. NK cells show spontaneous cytolytic activity against cells under stress such as tumor cells and virally-infected cells. After activation, NK cells also secrete several cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and chemokines that can modulate the function of other innate and adaptive immune cells. Cytotoxic cell lines (including our NK-92) have been established from patients with clonal NK-cell lymphoma. Those cells can be expanded in culture in the presence of cytokines (IL-2, IL-15). Our “off-the-shelf” NK cell platform has been molecularly engineered in a variety of ways to boost its killing capabilities against cancers and virally-infected cells. Unlike normal natural killer cells, our aNK cells do not express the key inhibitory receptors that diseased cells often exploit to turn off the killing function of NK cells and escape elimination. We have genetically engineered our aNK cell platform to overexpress high-affinity CD16 receptors that bind to antibodies. These antibody-targeted haNK cells are designed to directly bind to IgG1-type antibodies, such as avelumab, trastuzumab, cetuximab, and rituximab, with the intention of enhancing the cancer-killing efficacy of these antibodies by boosting the population of competent natural killer cells that can kill cancer cells through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
Our most advanced line of off-the-shelf product candidates is an innovative, bioengineered combination that incorporates all the features of our haNK platform together with a CAR (t-haNK). Product candidates under this platform have three modes of killing: innate, antibody-mediated, and CAR-directed killing. These product candidates also include one or more additional expression elements such as functional cytokines, chemokines and trafficking factors. These product candidates are intended to be combined with commercially available therapeutic antibodies to effectively target either two different epitopes of the same cancer-specific protein or two entirely different cancer specific proteins. Key trials studying our t-haNK product candidates have been initiated—PD-L1 t-haNK in Phase 1/2 trials in TNBC, and Phase 2 trials in pancreatic and GBM—and CD19 t-haNK has been cleared to commence Phase 1 testing in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. We believe we have a pipeline of other prominent CARs for t-haNK, including HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which are advancing through clinical-enabling studies, among others, which will enable us to potentially address an even broader range of cancers as part of a chemotherapy-free combination regimen. In March 2021, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), our PD-L1 t-haNK was reported to be a potent cell therapy agent against myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and overcome T cell escape in multiple types of resistant tumors (Fabian et al 2020). In January 2022, we reported on the results of our metastatic pancreatic cancer trial using PD-L1 t-haNK in combination with Anktiva. These findings, which were reported at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Conference in January 2022, showed a median overall survival of 6.3 months in patients who had progressed after two prior lines of therapy, more than doubling historical survival. We plan to meet with the FDA in 2022 to discuss a potential path for the approval of combination therapies for pancreatic cancer.

b.Autologous and allogenic memory-like cytokine-enhanced NK cells (M-ceNK)
Memory-like cytokine-enhanced NK cells are a unique set of lymphocytes that differentiate after a brief pre-activation with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15 and IL-18 and exhibit enhanced responses to cytokine re-stimulation that include enhanced IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity against leukemic cell lines. These cells have been isolated and characterized by their unique cell-surface marker profile and their highly desirable feature of immune-memory, marked by their pronounced anti-cancer activity for weeks to months in duration, which has made these cells a research focus for more than a decade. We have developed a unique ability to generate a portfolio of distinct M-ceNK cell products through the application of our proprietary GMP-in-a-Box bioreactors and cytokines and our proprietary methods and overall expertise in scale manufacturing of NK cell-based products. In May 2021, the FDA authorized the company to conduct a first-in-human trial to study the M-ceNK platform in solid tumors (QUILT 3.076). An initial clinical trial showed that healthy and patient-derived M-ceNK killed NK-resistant tumor cells.
c.Invariant natural killer T cells
iNKT cells are unique T cells that express an invariant aβ T-cell receptor (TCR) and a number of cell surface molecules in common with NK cells. Although they comprise less than 1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), they are important immunoregulatory cells that can quickly produce large amounts of cytokines. iNKT cell-derived cytokines and chemokines recruit and activate dendritic cells and can modulate several other cell types, including B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, macrophages and neutrophils. iNKT cells recognize glycolipid antigens presented by the non-polymorphic major histocompatability complex (MHC) Class I-like molecule, CD1d in contrast to conventional T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by MHC molecules. We entered into a binding term sheet with EnGeneIC to license EDV, which can be engineered to activate iNKT cells, to explore clinical development in the treatment of COVID-19 and pancreatic cancer. We plan on developing iNKT-cell vaccines, including for the prevention of COVID-19. EDV is now in Phase 3 clinical trials in Australia. Through the date of this Annual Report, the initial 2x109 EDV IM dose has shown little to no adverse events (AEs) with what we believe is promising antibody, memory B cell and T cell activity. In addition to expanding this trial in Australia and the U.S., we are exploring using the EDV technology in combination with our other vaccine constructs for select future trials.
5.Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns Inducers
DAMPs are released in response to cell stress and death, and elicit potent sterile inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that DAMPs may also have a key role in the development of cancer as well as in the host response to cytotoxic anti-tumor therapy. DAMPs may play a protective role by alerting the immune system to the existence of dying tumor cells, thereby triggering immunogenic tumor cell death. Albumin bound chemo modulators and tumor associated antigen regulators target delivery of the chemotherapy agent to the tumor microenvironment, activate tumor killing macrophages and/or enable a tumor suppressive microenvironment.
a.Aldoxorubicin
Aldoxorubicin is an albumin-associated anthracycline chemo modulator designed to target immune evasion in cancer. Aldoxorubicin has the same cytotoxic mechanism of action as doxorubicin, which is currently approved for use in 14 indications, including breast cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but also has unique pharmacological properties resulting in lower cardiotoxicity as shown in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for soft tissue sarcoma previously conducted by CytRx Corporation (CytRx). CytRx out-licensed global development, manufacturing, and commercialization rights for aldoxorubicin to us in 2017. The investigative therapeutic is currently in a Phase 2 trial in pancreatic cancer in combination with Anktiva and PD-L1 t-haNK, and we plan to include it in a new randomized, multi-center, Phase 2 GBM trial (QUILT 3.078) currently being developed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combinations of Anktiva, aldoxorubicin, PD-L1 t-haNK, and bevacizumab.

b.Nanatinostat
VRx-3996 (nanatinostat), an orally available histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, is being developed by Viracta. Nanatinostat is selective for specific isoforms of Class I HDACs, which is key to inducing viral genes that are epigenetically silenced in EBV-associated malignancies. In preclinical studies, nanatinostat has been shown to reactivate silenced transgenes in tumor cells thereby turning them into preferential targets for NK cell killing, while also serving to broadly stimulate a patient’s immune system, offering the potential for improved clinical responses in cancer patients. The activity of HDAC inhibitors are believed to be based on the upregulation of natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression on cancer cells, which serve as “eat-me” signals for NK cells and can drive NK proliferation, activation and cancer cell killing. We entered into an agreement with Viracta under which we were granted exclusive worldwide rights in patents and know-how related to nanatinostat for use in combination with our platform of NK cell therapies.
Our Pipeline
Our platforms, which include 17 first-in-human therapeutic agents, are being studied in 26 actively recruiting clinical trials—17 of which are in Phase 2 or 3 development—across 13 indications in liquid and solid tumors, including bladder, pancreatic and lung cancers. In infectious diseases, our pipeline currently targets such pathogens as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Through the date of this Annual Report, our product candidates have been tested in various Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials that have enrolled over 2,400 patients.

1.Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (QUILT 3.032) (QUILT 2.005)
In the U.S., bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly-diagnosed solid malignancy in men and twelfth in women. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 81,180 new cases and 17,100 deaths from bladder cancer in 2022. There is an urgent, unmet need to treat NMIBC and avoid radical cystectomy of the bladder in an attempt to control the disease. Although such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval, Anktiva has been awarded both Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS as well as Fast Track designation for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC papillary and BCG-naïve NMIBC CIS. In our QUILT 3.032 trial, the company reported that the primary end points were met for both BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS and papillary in October 2021 with a complete remission rate of 72% and a 12-month disease-free rate of 57%, respectively. Seminal patents covering intravesical administration of BCG and Anktiva were issued (US 11,173,191 B2 and US 9,925,247 B2) providing term coverage until 2035.
BCG-Unresponsive CIS (QUILT 3.032)
In our Phase 2/3 open-label multi-center trial of BCG-unresponsive high grade NMIBC CIS patients, the patients are receiving BCG plus Anktiva weekly for six consecutive weeks during induction. The patients also receive additional treatment including three weekly maintenance instillations every three months for up to 12 months and then at month 18. Patients with no disease or low-grade Ta disease at months 24, 30, and 36 are eligible for continued BCG plus Anktiva (Cohort A) or Anktiva alone (Cohort C) treatment (3 weekly instillations), at the principal investigators’ discretion. The primary endpoint of the BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS trial is a CR rate at any time equal to or greater than 30% and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval must be greater than or equal to 20% for success. Complete response, or the disappearance of measurable disease in response to treatment, is evaluated at three months or six months following initial administration of Anktiva plus BCG (and every three months thereafter until 24 months). This endpoint would be achieved once at least 24 of the 80 patients in the trial achieve complete response. 
All patients enrolled in Cohort A have been treated with the recommended number of full-strength doses of BCG on study during our trial. We have enrolled patients who have received a lower dosage of BCG therapy before enrollment in our trial as a result of BCG shortages. The mean and median number of prior BCG doses in Cohort A is 16.6 and 12.0, respectively, which are consistent with the FDA definition of BCG-unresponsive CIS. The FDA allowed our modification of the study design to allow enrollment of such patients, and definition of these patients may require further discussions with the FDA upon review. A published meta-analysis (Zeng 2015) of six relevant randomized controlled trials and two quasi-randomized controlled trials in NMIBC concluded that low-dose BCG instillation significantly reduces the incidence of overall side effects, especially severe and systemic symptoms in patients with NMIBC, while the oncological control efficacy of low-dose BCG is not inferior to standard-dose BCG. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with this conclusion. 
A data cutoff occurred in January 2022, which provided a median follow-up in Cohort A in excess of 24 months. Data presented at the ASCO® Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2022 showed a complete response in 59 of 83 patients 71% CR rate (95% CI: 60.1, 80.5) and a median duration of CR of 24.1 months. In those patients who responded to the investigational therapeutic, the probability of avoiding both progression of bladder cancer and cystectomy at 24 months exceeded 90%. The combination of Anktiva and BCG had a well-tolerated profile with 0% treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs), 0% immune-related AEs, and 100% bladder cancer-specific overall survival at 24 months. Low-grade treatment related AEs include dysuria, hematuria, and pollakiuria (all 16%), urgency (14%), and bladder spasm (8%), all other AEs were seen at 6% or less. No immune-related SAEs have been observed. We continue to engage in discussions with the FDA, and we anticipate filing a BLA for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS in the first quarter of 2022.

BCG-Unresponsive Papillary (QUILT 3.032)
In our Phase 2, open-label multi-center trial of BCG-unresponsive high grade NMIBC papillary patients (Cohort B), the patients are receiving BCG plus Anktiva weekly for six consecutive weeks during induction. The patients also receive additional treatment including three weekly maintenance instillations every three months for up to 12 months and then every nine months for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint of the trial is a 12-month disease free rate greater than or equal to 30% and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval must be greater than or equal to 20% for success. To meet the primary endpoint, 24 out of 80 patients must be disease free at 12 months. 
Data presented at the ASCO® Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2022 showed a 12-month disease-free rate of 57% (95% CI: 44, 68) in the papillary Cohort B, in which 73 of 77 patients (95%) have not progressed to radical cystectomy after a median duration of follow-up of 20.7 months, and a 99% bladder cancer-specific survival through the January 2022 data cutoff.
BCG-Naïve (QUILT 2.005)
As discussed above, Anktiva has been awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-naïve NMIBC CIS. We are currently enrolling patients in our Phase 2b blinded, randomized, two-cohort, open-label, multi-center trial of intravesical Anktiva plus BCG versus BCG alone, in BCG naïve patients with high-grade NMIBC CIS (Cohort A) and NMIBC papillary (Cohort B). Planned enrollment for Cohort A (CIS) and Cohort B (papillary) is 366 patients and 230 patients, respectively.
2.Lung Cancer (Lung-MAP) (QUILT 2.023) 
According to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S. In 2022, it is estimated that 236,740 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. and 130,180 deaths will be attributed to the disease. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers diagnoses and there are very few successful treatment options for these patients once the cancer spreads beyond the lungs. The development of checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been revolutionary, doubling the median overall survival in some settings; however, patient response may be short lived, due to late response and/or progression after achieving an initial response. As with bladder cancer, Anktiva enhances the proliferation and activation of NK and T cells critical for targeting and killing lung cancer cells. There is therefore a strong rationale to evaluate Anktiva in addition to an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor for patients with NSCLC who have relapsed after achieving an initial response to PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
Analysis of the pooled data from a Phase 1/2 trial conducted from January 2016 to June 2017 in 23 patients, and a subsequent investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial conducted by the Medical University of South Carolina, yielded confirmation of activity of the combination of checkpoint inhibitors and Anktiva in relapsed NSCLC. In 15 patients with PD-L1 greater than 50%, the overall response rate was 38% and the median overall survival rate was 17.1 months. These preliminary findings were favorable relative to the historical response rate seen in this patient population in the first-line setting with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
Table of Contents

On the basis of these findings, we initiated a single-arm Phase 2b multi-cohort basket trial (QUILT 3.055) of Anktiva and checkpoint inhibitor combinations in patients who have previously received treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors per an FDA-approved indication. Patients enrolled in this trial were eligible if actively progressing on checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Upon enrollment, patients continued on the same checkpoint inhibitor but with the addition of Anktiva. Despite progressing on checkpoint inhibitor therapy upon entry into the trial, the majority of patients reverted to stable disease and demonstrated durability of stable disease, some extending as long as nine months. Data presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in 2021 showed that despite the patients’ prior progression on checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone, upon entry into the trial the majority of patients experienced clinical benefit either as stable disease (49%) or a partial response (9%). Among 133 cancer patients enrolled in QUILT 3.055, the common Anktiva attributed grade 1 and 2 AEs included: injection site reaction (71%), chills (34%), fatigue (27%), pyrexia (24%), flu-like illness (13%), and decreased appetite (10%). A total of 18 grade 3 and 4 AEs attributed to Anktiva have been reported among 16 patients (12%) in the trial as of February 2021. All reported grade 3 and 4 AEs occurred at a frequency of 5% or less; two patients reported increased alanine amino transferase, increased aspartate amino transferase or increased blood alkaline phosphatase, anemia, injection-site reaction or injection-site pain. All other occurrences of grade 3 or 4 AEs that the clinical trial site investigators reported as suspected as being due to Anktiva include: decreased lymphocyte count; weight loss; influenza-like illness; injection site pruritus; cellulitis; injection-site cellulitis; sepsis; deep vein thrombosis; hypovolemic shock; colitis; diarrhea; delirium; respiratory failure; and maculopapular rash.
In October 2021, we announced that Anktiva had been chosen by Lung Cancer Master Protocol (Lung-MAP), a public-private partnership—which includes the NCI, the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Cooperative Groups (SWOG, ECOG-ACRIN, Alliance, and NRG), Friends of Cancer Research, and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH)—to study Anktiva in the Lung-MAP trial. The trial with Anktiva in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) will include up to 478 second-line patients with tumors that are not targetable with a drug, which accounts for the majority of NSCLC cases. In the fourth quarter of 2021, approval was received from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the Lung-MAP study to proceed with the trial—one of the NCI’s largest lung cancer clinical trials with more than 700 sites. Enrollment has begun for this trial.
We are enrolling patients in a randomized Phase 3 trial (QUILT 2.023) to evaluate Anktiva plus checkpoint inhibitor combinations versus other checkpoint inhibitor combinations in the first line setting for NSCLC. Patients will be treated as described below:
•Immunotherapy for either squamous or non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS >1% (Cohort A). Combination of Anktiva with Keytruda® versus Keytruda as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Chemoimmunotherapy for squamous NSCLC (Cohort B). Combination of Anktiva with Carboplatin, Abraxane® and Keytruda versus Carboplatin, Abraxane / paclitaxel and Keytruda as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Chemoimmunotherapy for non-squamous NSCLC (Cohort C). Combination of Anktiva with Cisplatin / Carboplatin, Keytruda and Pemetrexed versus Cisplatin / Carboplatin, Keytruda and Pemetrexed as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.

3.Pancreatic Cancer (QUILT 88)
According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in the U.S. pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women and has one of the highest mortality rates of all major cancers, taking nearly 50,000 lives every year, with a five-year survival rate for late-stage cases of only 3%. Exploratory Phase 1b/2 trials in patients with second-line or greater metastatic pancreatic cancer in which Anktiva and aldoxorubicin were combined with off-the-shelf NK (haNK) cells, other agents, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) showed encouraging results in patients with advanced disease. The primary endpoints of the Phase 1b and 2 portions of the trial were safety and objective response rate, respectively. In aggregate, 82% of patients (14/17) with advanced pancreatic cancer achieved disease control following combination therapy including Anktiva and aldoxorubicin. There were no Anktiva-related grade 3 or 4 AEs reported. 
On the basis of these exploratory trials, together with the preclinical findings that PD-L1 t-haNK is as active as haNK + anti-PD-L1 mAbs, we initiated a first- through third-line pancreatic cancer clinical trial (QUILT 88) that uses PD-L1 t-haNK as described below.
•First-line advanced pancreatic cancer (Cohort A). Combination of Anktiva with aldoxorubicin and low-dose chemotherapy plus SBRT with or without PD-L1 t-haNK versus gemcitabine/Abraxane® as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Second-line advanced pancreatic cancer (Cohort B). Combination of Anktiva with aldoxorubicin and low-dose chemotherapy plus SBRT + PD-L1 t-haNK versus 5FU/Onivyde® as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Third-line and beyond (Cohort C). Combination of Anktiva with aldoxorubicin and low-dose chemotherapy plus SBRT + PD-L1 t-haNK in a single arm cohort of this trial with a primary endpoint of overall survival. 
On October 13, 2021, we announced that the trial’s Cohort C was fully enrolled. In January 2022 at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium, we reported that 27% of third-line or greater patients (17/63) remain on study and that the median overall survival in this highly advanced group of patients (who failed two to six prior lines of treatment) is 5.8 months (95% CI: 3.9, 6.9 months) exceeding the approximately three-month historical median overall survival. Of the 63 patients, 30 (48%) had progressed after two prior lines of therapy. Median overall survival in this group was 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.0, 9.8 months), more than doubling the historical overall survival. (Survival of three months as reported by Manax et al ASCO GI 2019). In Cohort C, four patients (7%) experienced treatment-related SAEs that included peripheral edema, pyrexia, anemia and atrial flutter. No treatment-related deaths were reported.
Based on the strength of earlier data and the significant unmet medical need, we submitted an amendment to the FDA to increase enrollment in Cohort C and plan to meet with the FDA in 2022 to discuss a potential path for the approval of combination therapies for pancreatic cancer.
4.Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (QUILT 3.058)
According to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, globally more than 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 and 685,000 died from it. Triple-negative breast cancer is especially aggressive and accounts for 10-15% of breast cancers according to the American Cancer Society. In a prior exploratory Phase 1b/2 trial (QUILT 3.067), which included nine heavily pre-treated metastatic TNBC patients, we treated them with a combination immunotherapy that included Anktiva and aldoxorubicin, haNK cell therapy, along with several other immunotherapy agents. The primary endpoints of the Phase 1b and 2 portions of the trial were safety and objective response rate, respectively. The exploratory Phase 1b/2 trial in nine patients with advanced TNBC showed a disease control rate of 89% with a complete or partial response of 67% (6/9), including two patients (22%) with a complete response to the combination therapy. The median progression-free survival was 14.3 months with median overall survival of 20.2 months as of December 2020. Eight of the nine patients had primarily chemotherapy-related neutropenia or anemia, but all cases were low grade. A total of 27 grade 3 AEs were reported by 9 patients (100%) and included disease progression, pyrexia, mastitis, pneumonia, nausea, cholecystitis, and pain in extremity. However, none of these SEAs were attributed to Anktiva. There were three grade 3 haNK-related AEs with fever and fatigue, but no patient withdrew due to an SAE or experienced cytokine release syndrome.

Based on this encouraging data, in June 2021 we announced we had received FDA authorization to conduct a Phase 1b/2 open-label study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Anktiva and PD-L1 t-haNK cells in combination with standard chemotherapy and Trodelvy® (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) in patients with advanced TNBC. The study consists of two phases and will enroll up to 79 patients. The Phase 1b portion of the study has 2 parts: Part 1 involves dose escalation using a 3+3 design, and Part 2 involves the expansion of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy plus chemoimmunotherapy. The Phase 2 portion of the study is based on a Simon’s two-stage optimal design. In Phases 1b and 2, all patients receive sacituzumab govitecan-hziy plus chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy: cyclophosphamide, Anktiva, and PD-L1 t-haNK on a 3-week schedule. The dose of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is dependent on dose level cohort for Phase 1b and will be set at the RP2D for Phase 2. The doses of cyclophosphamide, Anktiva, and PD‑L1 t-haNK will remain the same in all dose level cohorts and phases. This trial is open and currently enrolling patients.
5.Glioblastoma Mulitforme (QUILT 3.078)
According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, GBM is the most common malignant brain and other tumors accounting for approximately 48% of all primary brain tumors with a low survival rate of approximately 40% in the first year after diagnosis and only 17% in the second year. A single arm Phase 2 trial was completed in 2016 that assessed the preliminary efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin administered to recurrent GBM patients who progressed after first-line therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was objective response rate. Out of 28 patients, investigator assessment of best overall tumor response reported three patients with a partial response, seven patients with progressive disease, and 11 patients with stable disease. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AEs included: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, and lymphopenia. 
A new randomized, multi-center, Phase 2 trial is currently being developed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combinations of Anktiva, aldoxorubicin, PD-L1 t-haNK and bevacizumab in this indication. A pilot phase will evaluate different combinations of triplets and the quadruplet, and a winner will be selected for the randomized portion versus bevacizumab monotherapy as the current standard of care for relapsed/refractory (r/r) GBM. We plan to begin enrollment of this trial in 2022.
6.Human Papillomavirus-Associated Tumors (Cervical and Head & Neck)
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every year about 19,400 women and 12,100 men experience cancers caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. According to the NCI, head and neck cancers account for nearly 4% of all cancers in the U.S. It was estimated that more than 68,000 men and women in the U.S. would be diagnosed with head and neck cancers in 2021. IBRX-042 leverages our hAd5-based vaccine platform to target tumors caused by HPV infection, which includes most types of cervical cancer and some types of head/neck cancers. Our second-generation hAd5 vector includes enhancements with the E1, E2b, E3 regions of the hAd5 deleted (E1-, E2b-, E3-), decreasing the risk for vector-directed immune responses that may reduce efficacy, while maintaining high target antigen production. The platform has previously been used to generate vaccines against tumor-associated antigens such as MUC1 and Brachyury. In IBRX-042, hAd5 encodes HPV-16 E6 and E7 tumor-associated proteins (oncotarget antigens). E6 and E7 play a role in early infection and, importantly, transformation of cells into rapidly-dividing tumor cells. Specifically, E6 promotes degradation of p53—a factor that typically prevents excess cell division—indirectly activates telomerase, and disrupts the function of the cellular phosphatase tumor suppressor PTPN13. E7 inactivates pRb (which plays a role similar to the p53) and activates Mi2b and is also implicated in transformation. Together, these oncogenic alterations drive rapid cellular proliferation, suppress or downregulate key tumor suppressor proteins, and lead to cellular immortality. In addition, E6 and E7 expression is required to maintain a malignant transformed phenotype. IBRX-042 has demonstrated the ability to induce immune responses against HPV16 antigens that induced significant anti-tumor effects in vivo in HPV+ mouse models. To support clinical studies, we have successfully completed the GMP production of GMP IBRX-042.
We are planning a Phase 1/2 open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) IBRX-042 vaccination combined with Anktiva (to enhance immune responses) and PD-L1 t-haNK cells in patients with HPV-associated tumors. We intend to add Anktiva to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination followed by PD-L1 t-haNK. We plan to begin enrollment of this trial in 2022.

7.Solid Tumor (QUILT 3.076)
An initial clinical trial showed that healthy and patient-derived M-ceNK cells killed NK-resistant tumor cells. We initiated a Phase 1 study of cryopreserved M-ceNK cells in combination with Anktiva to evaluate safety in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will compare the quantity and quality of the M-ceNK cells collected and manufactured from newly diagnosed patients who have not received prior treatment to the M-ceNK cells collected and manufactured from patients who have received at least two prior treatments for their cancer. The study consists of two cohorts and there will be 10 participants in each cohort. Cohort 1 includes participants with newly diagnosed high-risk solid tumors who have not received prior treatment; and Cohort 2 includes participants with r/r solid tumors who have progressive disease after receiving at least two prior therapies. Participants will be enrolled in the two cohorts simultaneously. Participants in Cohort 1 will participate in apheresis collection of lymphocytes (part A) and will not receive any investigational therapy in this study. Participants in Cohort 2 will undergo an apheresis collection of lymphocytes (part A) prior to receiving approximately four weeks of disease-specific therapy per their oncologists’ recommendations.
8.Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
According to the American Cancer Society, in 2022 it is estimated that 80,470 new cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) will be diagnosed in the U.S., and 20,250 deaths will be attributed to the disease. A Phase 1 trial evaluating Anktiva in combination with rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb therapy, in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL), who had relapsed or were refractory after two lines of therapy, was published in the American Association for Cancer Research journal, Clinical Cancer Research, in 2021. The combination regimen of Anktiva and Rituxan® was well tolerated with a single reported grade 4 AE and no reported grade 5 AEs. For patients with anti-CD20 mAb sensitive disease, the ORR in the SQ cohort was 78% (7 of 9) with 7 of 7 (100%) responses in the SQ cohorts were complete remissions (CRs).
Most B-cell malignancies express high levels of CD19, including the majority of NHLs, such as diffuse large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma. In addition, many leukemias express high levels of CD19, including B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and hairy cell leukemia. As such, two CD19‑directed CAR-T cell therapeutics are FDA-approved for use in a variety of indications including NHL and ALL. Like T cells, NK cells can be genetically modified to express CARs that recognize tumor‑associated cell-surface antigens and mediate specific recognition and lysis of cancer cells. A number of aNK cell lines that express CARs have been developed and importantly, aNK cells engineered with CARs targeting CD19 and CD20 have shown to be effective against in vitro/in vivo models of lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (Boissel 2013, Muller 2008, Romanski 2016). Derived from aNK, the haNK cell line is engineered to express the high-affinity variant of the Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIIa/CD16a 158V) as well as endoplasmic reticulum-retained IL-2, and has demonstrated enhanced ADCC-mediated antitumor activity (Jochems 2016). The CD19 t-haNK cell line combines the engineered enhancements of haNK cells with the expression of a CAR targeting CD19, and thus has potential to demonstrate robust ADCC antitumor activity against cancerous B cells and provide clinical benefit to patients with r/r NHL. We are currently developing an open-label, Phase 1 trial of CD19 t-haNK as a single agent and in combination with Anktiva and rituximab in patients with r/r NHL.
In addition to the studies listed above, we are pursuing several other both company-sponsored and investigator-initiated studies of our product candidates including in colon cancer (hAd5 CEA), Kaposi’s sarcoma (aldoxorubicin), and head and neck cancer (Anktiva, hAd5 CEA, MUC1, and Brachyury) among others.

Infectious Diseases
COVID-19 Programs
In order to address the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic, several key findings have emerged through intense research activity since the virus was first identified. We believe these findings include the need for second-generation COVID-19 vaccines with cross-reactive memory B and T cells in the face of antigenic drift and a heterologous prime/boost approach without cold chain limitations. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were developed with exceptional speed and initially showed a high degree of efficacy against the wild-type virus, with RNA vaccines showing the highest degree of efficacy and a sound safety profile. However, in the time since their authorization, we believe that a number of important limitations have been recognized. First, these vaccines have required boosting for increased efficacy. Second, their availability in the low income global community has been limited. Third, they have shown reduced efficacy against emergent variants of concern (VOC). Fourth, they exhibit heat-sensitivity and require a cold chain that may be infeasible in many low-resource settings. Researchers aim to address these limitations and have recently made several relevant advances. For example, second-generation COVID-19 vaccines with DNA and RNA delivery platforms that are heat-stable, potent and broadly protective against multiple VOC have been developed and are in clinical trials. Additionally, vaccines which stimulate the innate immune system through the TLR system invoke strong and broad humoral and cellular responses. We believe that T cell immunity plays a central role in the control of SARS-CoV-2 and its importance may have been relatively underestimated thus far. Our COVID-19 vaccine product candidates are designed to provide second-generation T cell as well as antibody-based protection.
a.Spike in Combination with Nucleocapsid
Since the inception of the pandemic, we have hypothesized that antibody-based vaccines, specifically those that target the S protein alone, would prove insufficient over an extended time period to prevent transmission and infectivity due to their inability to overcome viral evolution in the face of a rapidly mutating S protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In fact, what has been observed over the past year is that anti-S antibody levels and immune protection against COVID-19 subsides following vaccination with currently available S targeting vaccines, requiring booster shots at approximately six months. Compounding the limitations of an S-only approach is the spike protein is under intense immune pressure from vaccine-induced antibodies, which drives the evolution of vaccine escape variants. Internal proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as the N protein, are more highly conserved and less subject to mutation and thus may be more appropriate targets to maintain vaccine efficacy in the face of this viral evolution. 
Table of Contents

From the onset, we believed strongly that an immune response generating a combination of antibodies, T cells, and memory B cells is critical to prevent infection, reduce viral load, prevent transmission, provide durable protection and ultimately overcome this pandemic. Therefore, we focused our efforts on developing vaccine candidates with an S-Fusion + N-ETSD that express both an optimized viral spike (S) protein (S-Fusion) and a nucleocapsid protein with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) that directs N to the endo/lysosomal subcellular compartment to enhance MHC Class II responses. In order to reduce viral load, T cells are necessary to kill virally-infected cells in the nasal and lung passages and thereby prevent transmission even from highly transmissible variants. We performed a non-human primate COVID virus challenge study in September 2020 (supported by BARDA and published in September 2021 in Frontiers in Immunology entitled, “Dual-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccine Subcutaneous Prime Delivery with Oral Boosts Protects NHP Against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge”) confirming that our second-generation adenovirus hAd5 S+N vaccine accomplished the goal of reducing viral load to non-detectable levels following a COVID-19 virus challenge. 
On the basis of these findings, a program was designed to pursue this strategy of driving T cell and antibody protection, and to develop a second-generation vaccine with broad depth of antigenic coverage. The initial study, which began in March 2020, showed that hAd5 S+N vaccination as a single prime alone induced a 10-fold increase in mean T cell responses in Phase 1 participants that were sustained against spike variants.
b.Heterologous Prime Boost
Moreover, since initiating the initial homologous prime boost trial in the U.S., it has become apparent that a “mix-and-match” strategy (i.e., a heterologous approach combining different vaccine platforms) could potentially provide maximal immune protection against current and future variants such as Delta and Omicron. For example a “Prime” with an RNA vaccine leads to strong antibody response while a “Boost” with a DNA or an EDV/adjuvant vaccine could convey strong cellular immune responses. On this basis we have acquired the rights to multiple platforms and initiated a consortium that includes 3M, Amyris, BCM, EnGeneIC and IDRI to develop, manufacture and scale second-generation vaccines that combine different advanced DNA, RNA, protein constructs, and adjuvants. We have adopted a long-term approach to addressing COVID-19 and future pandemics and believe these mix-and-match components are critical to providing accessible, broad, and durable protection. Importantly we believe that the technologies behind these heterologous approaches are not burdened by the limitations of first-generation RNA cold-chain requirements.
1.hAd5 S+N Platform Prime & Boost—U.S. (COVID 4.001 and 4.005) and South Africa COVID (4.007) 
In October 2020, the FDA authorized a Phase 1 trial of our dual construct Spike+Nucleocapsid (hAd5 S+N) COVID-19 vaccine, designed to drive both T cell and antibody immunity. We undertook a rigorous development strategy to explore multiple methods of administration (oral, intranasal, subcutaneous, and combinations of each) to determine the best site of delivery to achieve maximum antibody, T cell and mucosal immunity. In February 2021, this trial was expanded to South Africa (the ProVIVA-SA1 Trial). Through the date of this Annual Report, 114 participants have enrolled in the U.S. and South African Phase 1 trials. Data acquisition and analysis from both trials is ongoing. Preliminary analysis has shown that subcutaneous dosing of hAd5 S+N provides strong T-cell responses to both Spike and Nucleocapsid antigens with no SAEs reported through the date of this Annual Report. These trials formed the basis of the Universal T Cell Boost Trial (SISONKE Boost Trial) activated in South Africa in July 2021. 
2.SISONKE Boost Trial—South Africa (COVID 4.010)
In July 2021 we announced authorization from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) to proceed with our SISONKE T-Cell Universal Boost trial in South Africa. This Phase 1/2/3 trial was the first DNA/DNA heterologous mix-and-match trial of Ad26 and hAd5 and was designed to study the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of ImmunityBio’s T-Cell COVID-19 vaccine as a boost in participants who had already received a spike-only antibody-based vaccine. The trial is designed to explore whether the T cell-based vaccine could prevent breakthrough infections from the Delta variant in health care workers who are already vaccinated. The goal of the hAd5 S+N vaccine is to potentially provide increased protection and long-term immunity against the multiple variants and multiple waves affecting South Africa and other countries. The SISONKE Universal Boost Phase 2 trial is fully enrolled with 60 participants with no SAEs reported through the date of this report. The Phase 3 trial is now open and enrollment began in January 2022.

3.THEMBA saRNA Vaccine Boost—South Africa (COVID 4.015) and U.S. (COVID 4.016) 
The THEMBA trials are the first studies of our saRNA with next-generation NLCs. In South Africa, we initiated the filing of a Phase 1/2 trial assessing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of saRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 as boost vaccines in participants that have been previously vaccinated against or previously infected with COVID-19, which is under regulatory review at the SAHPRA awaiting authorization to begin. In the U.S., we submitted a similar Phase 1/2 trial design for FDA review in the first quarter of 2022. The Phase 1 trial, for up to 60 previously vaccinated/infected participants will be enrolled as 6 separate cohorts to receive a single vaccine boost consisting of different doses of either saRNA encoding the Spike protein (AAHI-SC2 vaccine) or saRNA encoding the Spike and nucleocapsid proteins (AAHI-SC3 vaccine) delivered by NLC. The Phase 2 trial, of up to 120 previously vaccinated/infected additional participants, will be enrolled with a randomized 1:1:1:1 design to receive Janssen, Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (control arm), the AAHI-SC2 vaccine (experimental arm 1), or the AHHI-SC3 (experimental arms 2 and 3).
4.PULA Trial RBD Subunit Protein with TLR Adjuvant Boost—Botswana (COVID 4.014)
We plan on submitting a Phase 1/2/3 trial assessing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a yeast-based COVID-19 vaccine with a TLR activating adjuvant to the Botswana Medical Research Authority (BOMRA) to be called PULA. In November 2021, we announced we had licensed a recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine (RBD Subunit) candidate from BCM. Protein-based vaccines have long been used to confer immunity against hepatitis B and HPV, as immune responses often target proteins that are part of viruses and bacteria. This recombinant protein vaccine technology is proven and well-established. Production of these vaccines can be easily scaled up in low-resource countries. We are combining this subunit protein with a 3M-052/Alum adjuvant and related technology licensed from IDRI and 3M Company and its affiliates in this PULA trial.
HIV
In June 2021, we announced the opening of a Phase 1 “HIV Cure Study” in patients on therapy and a Phase 2 study in acutely infected patients. Both studies have opened and are actively enrolling participants.
1.HIV Cure Study
Sponsored by the NIAID and AIDS Clinical Trials Group, the “HIV Cure Study” will evaluate whether Anktiva alone or together with broadly neutralizing antibodies can control HIV following interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The Phase 1 open-label, randomized trial will enroll 46 people living with HIV whose virus has been suppressed by ART for approximately two years, including at least 30% cisgender women or transgender men. 
2.Thai Red Cross and the US Military HIV Research Program
An additional Phase 2 trial, enrolling 15 patients, has been initiated with the Thai Red Cross and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program. The trial is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunostimulatory effects of administering Anktiva during acute HIV infection. Anktiva will be administered subcutaneously at weeks zero, three and six (for a total of three doses) and will be initiated together with antiretroviral therapy in order to determine if the immunostimulatory effects of Anktiva will reduce the amount of HIV present during acute infection. The trial duration for individual participants will be approximately 12 weeks. It is hypothesized that Anktiva initiated with anti-retroviral therapy during acute HIV infection will not result in complications or additional toxicities compared with anti-retroviral therapy alone, and may result in a reduced viral load in these patients by inhibiting early establishment of HIV reservoirs in infected individuals. 
3.NIAID University of Minnesota Trial
An ongoing Phase 1b, non-randomized, open label clinical trial sponsored by the University of Minnesota in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is investigating the effect of Anktiva on B cell follicles in antiretroviral treated HIV disease. This trial includes 10 HIV-infected adults on effective antiretroviral therapy who will receive Anktiva to intensively investigate the immunological effects of treatment. The hypothesis is that in HIV infected humans treated with Anktiva, CD8 T cells will migrate to and increase in number in B cell follicles that will result in a reduction in the frequency of cells with an inducible HIV provirus. The trial is fully enrolled, and there are currently 2 active patients on study as of this date of this report.

Our Large-Scale GMP Biologic Manufacturing Capabilities
ImmunityBio has adopted a strategic position to be vertically integrated and develop its products according to the FDA’s GMP standards for large-scale manufacturing, even during Phase 2 clinical trial development. Biological upstream and downstream manufacturing capabilities, with its attendant know-how and regulatory compliance for approval, have long lead times. We have adopted an approach for preparedness to provide our vaccine, immunotherapy and cell therapy products at a global scale. As such, we have established our own plants and have access to facilities on a global basis. 
Our ability to create an efficient manufacturing process and supply chain will be important in enabling us to develop novel therapies. Our strategy is to anticipate the needs of our early-stage research and development initiatives for preclinical and eventual clinical product candidates with a focus on rapid capability to produce at scale fusion proteins, hAd5, saRNA, subunit protein, EDV, and NK cell products. In addition, our pipeline for development of synthetic small molecules and immunomodulatory peptides uses innovative technology to derive new therapies. We believe members of our management team, many of whom have experience in both nanoparticle commercialization and large-scale injectable drug production, are capable of constructing the processes and commissioning the facilities necessary to meet our development and commercialization goals. For well-known processes, we currently work, and plan to continue working, with established contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to produce drug substance and drug products. In addition, we plan to further enhance our in-house manufacturing capabilities for drug substances, drug products, and labeling and packaging. 
Overview of our Manufacturing Model 
Our manufacturing capabilities include advanced technology facilities to produce and test various drug substances and drug products. Our experienced operations and quality team focuses on internal manufacturing and testing with a constant endeavor to create robust, high quality, efficient and consistent supply that meets target product profiles. Our Phase 1 manufacturing process is designed to seamlessly scale-up through all phases of clinical development to commercial manufacturing to drive successful commercialization.
Commercial cGMP Production
For our Anktiva product candidate, we have contracted with a multi-national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia for our current clinical trials and future commercial sales, if approved. The facilities have robust process development and validation and quality oversight with high-capacity production suites operating multiple 2,000-20,000L production bioreactors. 
Clinical Trial GMP Antibody and Fusion Protein Production 
We are establishing a cGMP-compliant multi-platform facility in California, which includes a large space for the production of antibodies and fusion proteins (including Anktiva) to treat cancers and infectious diseases. This facility will include fully integrated biologic upstream and downstream production suites and a quality assurance/quality control release laboratory for high-capacity antibody and fusion protein production.
Table of Contents

Clinical Trial GMP saRNA, Adenovirus, and Yeast Production
We have established other cGMP-compliant facilities for saRNA, adenovirus, and yeast production in multiple sites in California and a site in Colorado for oncology and infectious diseases. One of our sites in California is dedicated to adenovirus product candidates for the production of vaccine candidates to treat infectious diseases. These facilities generally have fully-integrated biologic upstream and downstream production suites and quality assurance/quality control release laboratories for high capacity, continuous, or personalized just-in-time vaccine production.
Clinical Trial GMP NK Cell Therapy Production
We have established other cGMP-compliant facilities for NK cell therapy product production in multiple sites in California for oncology. One of our sites in California is dedicated to our off-the-shelf product candidates (including PD-L1 t‑haNK), while another is primarily focused on our M-ceNK product candidates, including a training lab for our second-generation offerings.
cGMP ISO Class 5 Manufacturing Facility
On February 14, 2022, we acquired a leasehold interest in approximately 409,000 rentable square feet of cGMP ISO Class 5 pharmaceutical manufacturing space in western New York (the Dunkirk Facility). This facility provides us with a state-of-the-art biotech production center that substantially expands and diversifies our existing manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and will be used across all of our key platforms. See Note 13, Subsequent Events, of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” that appears in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for additional information.
Manufacture of Platform Product Candidates
ImmunityBio’s diverse product candidate portfolio and pipeline requires a broad knowledge of various manufacturing and quality assurance methods. We have invested heavily in the processes, systems and technology to build an extensive range of manufacturing programs spanning various levels of development from IND-enablement through BLA preparation of our first commercial product.
We believe our plan to selectively use CMOs for certain of our assets at various stages, coupled with internal development, will give us assurance that any products will have backup manufacturing options.

Competition
We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, convenience, cost, market access, level of promotional activity devoted to them, competitive intensity, and intellectual property protection.
We have focused our efforts on oncological and infectious disease indications that are difficult to treat and with large unmet needs, and we believe our platform will be broadly applicable across multiple tumor types and infections. Based on the breadth and depth of our platforms, we believe our competitors will range from large pharmaceutical companies to emerging novel biotechnology companies.

In the HIV space, we have product candidates that use Anktiva that will likely compete with companies who have approved therapeutics for HIV, including Abbott Laboratories Inc., BMS, Gilead, and GSK. 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer therapeutics and immunotherapy. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available, as well as on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed, acquired, and in-licensed patents and patent applications across platforms as previously described for: (1) activated NK and T cells; (2) memory T cell activation; and (3) activated tumoricidal macrophages. With respect to activated NK and T cells, we have developed Anktiva, an N72D variant IL-15 complexed to a dimeric IL-15Ra/Fc fusion protein; with respect to memory T cell activation, we have developed adenoviral and yeast immunotherapies expressing tumor antigens such as CEA, MUC1, and Brachyury, and in-licensed saRNA technologies; and with respect to activated tumoricidal macrophages, we have in-licensed intellectual property licensed to aldoxorubicin, a tumor-targeted doxorubicin conjugate, from CytRx.

Table of Contents

The term of individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or successful appeals against USPTO actions. There is no statutory limit on this patent term adjustment, which is generally the length of any such delays caused by the USPTO. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. While we plan to seek such patent term adjustments and extensions where applicable, there is no guarantee that the USPTO and/or FDA will agree with our assessment of whether such adjustments or extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such adjustments or extensions. The duration of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the U.S. The patent situation outside of the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the U.S. and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any current pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed in the future, nor can we be sure that any existing patents or any patents that may be granted in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and the methods used to manufacture those product candidates. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product candidate, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
Our registered trademark portfolio currently contains approximately 9 registered trademarks in the U.S., approximately 25 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, approximately 7 pending trademark applications in the U.S., and approximately 11 pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions. We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, see Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property” and Item 3., “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report.

In 2020, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with GlobeImmune, a consolidated entity of the company, pursuant to which we obtained worldwide, exclusive licenses under certain patents, know-how, and other intellectual property to use, research, develop and commercialize products with GlobeImmune’s COVID-19 vaccine program, other Tarmogen-based programs, and neoepitopes programs in exchange for a license fee for the first two years of the agreement totaling $1.2 million, up to $345.0 million in milestone payments related to the successful completion of clinical and regulatory milestones and up to $240.0 million in total milestone payments based on licensed product net sales milestones, and a royalty on net sales of licensed products, on a product-by-product basis ranging in percentage from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens. We may terminate this agreement, in whole or on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product and/or country-by-country basis, at any time upon sixty (60) days written notice to GlobeImmune. 
Infectious Disease Research Institute 
In May 2021, we entered into two license agreements with the IDRI pursuant to which we received a license to certain patents and know-how relating to IDRI’s (i) adjuvant formulations for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (the IDRI Adjuvant Formulation License Agreement) and (ii) RNA vaccine platform as further described below (the IDRI RNA License Agreement). Under both agreements, we were obligated to pay one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable upfront cash payments totaling $2.0 million. In addition, under the IDRI Adjuvant Formulation License Agreement we owe IDRI milestone payments to a total of up to $2.5 million based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for the first licensed product and royalties on annual net sales of licensed products on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis of a low-single digit percentage, subject to certain royalty-reduction provisions. 
In September 2021, we amended and restated the IDRI RNA License Agreement, pursuant to which IDRI granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to IDRI’s rights to an RNA vaccine platform for the development and commercialization of certain therapeutic, diagnostic or prophylactic products for the prevention, treatment or diagnosis of any indication, other than those subject to pre-existing third-party license grants, including, without limitation, SARS-CoV-2. Pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated IDRI RNA License Agreement, we were required to make an additional one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable, upfront payment to IDRI of $1.5 million. The company is also required to pay license maintenance fees to IDRI as follows: $3.0 million in 2022 and $5.5 million annually from 2023 through 2030. The company may terminate the restated agreement without cause by paying IDRI a $10.0 million one-time early termination fee. In addition, the milestone payments to IDRI based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for the first licensed product were amended to a total of up to $4.0 million. We are required to pay royalties on annual net sales of licensed products on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis of a low- to mid-single digit percentage. 
In connection with the license agreements, in May 2021 we also entered into a sponsored research agreement (SRA) with IDRI pursuant to which we will fund continued research of at least $2.0 million per year, payable in four equal quarterly installments each year until May 2024, or such year of earlier termination.

Altor has the first right to enforce the patents licensed pursuant to the agreement, subject to Beike’s ability to exercise such right if Altor fails to do so. Altor and Beike each have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party. 
Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.
In 2015, we and Sorrento established NANTibody as a stand-alone biotechnology company with $100.0 million in initial joint funding. We own 60% of the equity interests and Sorrento owns 40% of the equity interests in NANTibody, which focuses on accelerating the development of multiple therapeutic product candidates that are being developed as standalone treatments as well as in combination with other therapies as part of an immune-oncology treatment regimen.
In 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sorrento pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license under certain patent rights and antibody materials, including antibody sequences and complementary DNA (cDNA) and clones and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, in each case to use, research and develop certain antibodies and anti-body drug conjugates (ADCs) including for neoepitopes, which are epitopes resulting from mutations specific to an individual’s cancer cells, and to commercialize the resulting licensed products, in exchange for consideration that included an upfront cash payment of $10 million, equity consideration with a valuation of $100 million, and mid-single digit percentage royalties on net sales of the resulting licensed products. Our obligation to pay royalties continues, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the date on which such licensed product is no longer covered by a valid claim of a patent licensed pursuant to the agreement in such country and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In addition, the agreement provides us with the right to negotiate an exclusive license from Sorrento for two CAR-T/NK cell products to be mutually determined on terms substantially similar to the terms of the license agreement.

In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party.
In 2019, we filed cross-claims against Sorrento in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, alleging that Sorrento breached the exclusive license agreement with us; these claims are now being pursued in arbitration. In January 2020 and April 2020, Sorrento sent letters purporting to terminate the exclusive license agreement with us and the exclusive license agreement with NANTibody. We believe we have cured any perceived breaches during the 90-day contractual cure period provided under the agreements. Sorrento filed counterclaims against the company and NANTibody in the arbitration and requested leave to file a dispositive motion. The hearings in the NANTibody arbitration commenced in April 2021 and concluded in early August 2021. After post-hearing briefing was concluded, the parties were notified on November 30, 2021 that the arbitrator in the NANTibody arbitration had passed away. A substitute arbitrator was appointed on February 25, 2022, and the parties will work with the substitute arbitrator to conclude the proceedings.

Government Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates biopharmaceuticals under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Biopharmaceuticals also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Any of these actions or events could have a material impact on the availability of our product candidates.
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee for each clinical site before the clinical trial is begun;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA, after completion of all required clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA/NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidates’ continued safety, quality, purity and potency or efficacy, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; 
•FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S.; and 
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Table of Contents

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an IND product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
When a clinical trial using genetically engineered cells is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for wild-type DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving wild-type DNA, and many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety, or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. If the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirement, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
Table of Contents

For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2. The investigational product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy or potency of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy or potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
•Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the trial, and any disruption of the trial as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a list of all subjects affected by the COVID-19-pandemic related study disruption by unique subject identifier and by investigational site and a description of how the individual’s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the trial. In June 2020, FDA also published a guidance on Good Manufacturing Practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in drug and biological products manufacturing. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.
BLA/NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA for a biologic product candidate or an NDA for a small molecule product candidate requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA/NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA/NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA/NDA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees typically increase annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
Table of Contents

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA/NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA/NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA/NDA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA/NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective, or safe, pure and potent for the proposed indication(s) and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency or efficacy. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA/NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. If applicable, FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products with the FDA and to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA/NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. After the FDA evaluates a BLA/NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA/NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA/NDA with a REMS plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other restrictions to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA/NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A Fast Track-designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Table of Contents

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA/NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the product’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA) established Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a Breakthrough Therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the product candidate to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough Therapy designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA/NDA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a Breakthrough Therapy for some or all of our product candidates.
Breakthrough Therapy and/or Fast Track designations and priority review do not change the standards for approval. The receipt of such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval. 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for certain drugs and biological products, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs/BLAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the U.S. will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
Table of Contents

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA or NDA, to market the same biologic or drug product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Emergency Use Authorization
Operation Warp Speed (OWS) aimed to deliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine for COVID-19 by January 2021, and was part of a broader government strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. OWS was a partnership among components of HHS, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA, the NIH, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Department of Defense; engaged with private firms and other federal agencies; and coordinated existing HHS-wide efforts, including the NIH’s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines partnership, NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, and work by BARDA. A COVID-19 vaccine product may be approved initially under an emergency use authorization (EUA) followed by a full BLA approval when more data are available and submitted to FDA for approval.
On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of HHS determined that the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens. On the basis of such determination, on March 27, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 outbreak, pursuant to Section 564 of the FDCA, which permits the FDA Commissioner to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in the COVID-19 public health emergency. FDA has created the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, a new program designed to expedite the development of potential COVID-19 therapies by using every tool at the agency’s disposal to determine if the therapies are safe and effective for their intended uses. In issuing an emergency use authorization, FDA will consider the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA regarding safety, efficacy and known and potential risks of such products and availability of alternatives to the emergency use products, among others. Emergency Use Authorizations issued by FDA will specify the scope authorization and conditions of authorization, including limitations on distribution and conditions related to product advertising and promotion. Once granted, an EUA is effective will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated under Section 564(b)(2) of the FDCA or the EUA is revoked under Section 564(g) of the FDCA, after which the product must be approved by FDA under a traditional pathway in order to remain on the market or to continue commercialization of the product.

Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us, and any third-party manufacturers, that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA or NDA.
Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics or drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion from participation in governmental health programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements for Medical Devices
Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt (PMA) from the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a PMA is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class 1 devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FDCA, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class 1 devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FDCA, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class 2 devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class 2 devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class 3. A Class 3 device cannot be marketed in the U.S. unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class 3 devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in orders to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class 3.
There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special; and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification needs a new 510(k) but does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class 1, 2 or 3 are automatically classified into Class 3 regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class 3 due to the absence of a predicate device, called the Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class 3 Designation (or the De Novo Classification Process).
Table of Contents

This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class 3 to request down-classification of its medical device into Class 1 or Class 2 on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class 2, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Pre-market Approval Pathway
A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA for Class 3 devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) pre-market notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device.
After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.
Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA application which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA application is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii)issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
Table of Contents

Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the U.S., for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified trial sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and trial protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trial sites. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product.
Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinical trials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration.
Ongoing Medical Device Regulation by the FDA
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing;
•the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
•post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class 2 or 3 devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacture’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.
Table of Contents

Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA application often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, some states require us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and similar state agencies may inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that the manufacturer maintain proper documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, the FDA requires medical device manufacturers to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our medical device product candidates;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
•withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and
•criminal prosecution.
The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require medical device manufacturers to provide information to the FDA when they receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our medical device product candidates under development. Medical device manufacturers are also subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, CMS, other divisions of HHS and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the AKS, the FCA, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
Table of Contents

The AKS prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated. The government has enforced the AKS to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs, as well as private payors.
Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the FCA, imposes liability on persons or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General, or as a qui tam action by a private individual, in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the AKS, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product candidates, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Table of Contents

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals. The ACA, among other things, under the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, imposed reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to certain covered recipients, including physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, for data reported to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2022, these reporting obligations with respect to covered recipients have been extended to include payments and transfers of value made to non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses, or collectively, covered entities, and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” which includes independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other providers, independent contractors, or entities with whom we do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment, which could affect our ability to operate our business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payors. Third-party payors include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our revenues and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical trials to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, as each payor will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payor’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payor will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
Table of Contents

•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, followed by a 1% payment adjustment from April 1 to June 30, 2022 and a 2% payment adjustment beginning July 1, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the ARTA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at increasing competition for prescription drugs. Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 
Since the enactment of the ACA, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, or healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in material adverse effect on our business.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. These measures could reduce the demand for our products, if approved, or impose additional pricing pressures on how much we can charge for our products if approved.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress may continue to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as a whole is currently unknown. However, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. may have on our business.

Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to develop or sell any product candidates outside of the U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Human Capital
Our Human Capital Talent Strategy relies on attracting, retaining and developing top talent that align with our culture and mission to “outsmart your disease”. We promote a culture that is focused on delivering treatments utilizing natural immunities, and we seek to harness our science first focus to deliver solutions to patients and families. As of December 31, 2021, we had 587 employees located in our offices in Southern California, Washington, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Italy. Among our employees, 23% are focused on research and development, 13% on clinical development and regulatory, 45% on manufacturing and quality, and 19% on general and administrative functions. We have not been subject to labor action or union activities, and our management considers its relationships with employees to be good.
We believe that fostering a workplace that celebrates differences and strengths creates an environment that supports the inclusion and value of diverse thoughts, backgrounds and perspectives. A well rounded culture allows for ongoing dialogue and discussions that challenge the status quo and create a learning environment that supports diversity, equity and inclusion. As part of our commitment we continue to encourage a culture where employees can freely ask questions and raise concerns. Our annual performance review process helps support our commitment to develop and retain top talent by providing an opportunity to have open dialogue, establish goals, discuss milestones and continue to engage in opportunities to develop and cultivate the talent. Additionally, our management team makes themselves available to all employees including 1:1s, Department Meetings and Town Hall events.
Our ongoing success will continue to depend on our ability to attract, engage and retain top talent in an ever growing competitive market. We offer a competitive compensation package to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include annual bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, an employee assistance program, among others. We work to ensure pay equity by assessing our compensation practices and working with external benchmarks and compensation consultants to design and benchmark our programs.
Our ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which complies with government orders in all the states and counties where we operate, focuses on employee health and wellness. We implemented a number of health-related measures over the past two years. We continue to support a general work from home policy and restrict on-site access to essential employees such as laboratory personnel, increasing hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures at our office and laboratory facilities, requiring face masks be worn while on company premises, and implementing temperature checks and COVID-19 testing requirements in order to enter company facilities.
Organization and Development of ImmunityBio, Inc.
ImmunityBio, Inc. was established following a series of mergers and name changes. We were incorporated in Illinois on October 7, 2002 under the name ZelleRx Corporation. Our name was later changed to Conkwest, Inc., and we were reincorporated in the state of Delaware in March 2014. On July 10, 2015, we changed our name to NantKwest, Inc. 
NantCell, LLC was originally organized as a Delaware limited liability company in November 2014. In April 2015, it was converted to a Delaware corporation, NantCell, Inc., and in May 2019 changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc. (a private company).

On December 21, 2020, NantKwest, Inc. and ImmunityBio, Inc. entered into a merger agreement (the Merger Agreement) providing for the combination of the two companies (the Merger), with NantKwest, Inc. being the surviving company which then changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc. (and ImmunityBio, Inc., a private company, changed its name back to NantCell, Inc. and is now our wholly owned subsidiary). At the time, NantKwest, Inc. was an innovative, clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system to treat cancer and infectious diseases, and ImmunityBio, Inc. was a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing next-generation therapies that drive immunogenic mechanisms for defeating cancer and infectious diseases, with an immunotherapy platform designed to activate both the innate and adaptive immune systems to create long-term “immunological memory.” We believe that the Merger, which closed on March 9, 2021 as described below, combined two companies to create a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that complement, harness, and amplify the immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. 
ImmunityBio is incorporated in Delaware and its principal executive offices are located in San Diego, California.
