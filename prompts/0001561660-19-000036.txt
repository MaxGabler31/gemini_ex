Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are a vertically integrated renewable energy company with a mission to transform the world to renewable energy. Our business consists of (i) an operating business segment which is comprised of a portfolio of high-quality renewable energy power projects located in many attractive markets that produces long-term stable cash flows and (ii) ownership interests in an upstream development platform aligned with our operating business which provides us access to a pipeline of projects and potential for higher returns through project development.
Through our operating business segment, we hold ownership interests in 24 renewable energy projects with an operating capacity that totals approximately 4 gigawatts (GW) which are located in the United States, Canada and Japan. Our projects use proven, best-in-class technology and have contracted to sell all or a majority of their output pursuant to long-term, fixed-price PSAs. Approximately 92% of the electricity expected to be generated by our projects in which we have an owned interest will be sold under PSAs that have a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years as of December 31, 2018. 
We own an approximate 29% interest in Pattern Development which engages in the development of projects around the world primarily in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. Pattern Development seeks to promote environmental stewardship and works closely with communities to create renewable energy projects. Our arrangements with Pattern Development include rights of first offer, shared services, and overlap of executive officers. We have sought to align our interests to provide us access to a pipeline of development projects that we have an ability to acquire to grow our business, or (through our approximate 29% interest) to share in returns realized by Pattern Development when it sells projects to third parties. Pattern Development has more than a 10 GW pipeline of development projects.
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in October 2012 and conducted an initial public offering in October 2013.
Our Core Values and Financial Objectives
We intend to maximize long-term value for our stockholders in an environmentally responsible manner and with respect for the communities in which we operate. Our business is built around three core values of creative energy and spirit, pride of ownership, and a team-first attitude, which guide us in: 

• | creating a safe and high-integrity work environment for our employees;


• | applying rigorous analysis to all aspects of our business in a timely, disciplined and functionally integrated manner to understand patterns in wind and solar regimes, technology developments, market trends and regulatory, financial and legal constraints; and


• | working proactively with our stakeholders to address environmental and community concerns, which we believe is a socially responsible approach that also benefits our business by reducing operating risks at our projects.

Our financial objectives, which we believe will maximize long-term value for our stockholders, are to: 

• | produce stable and sustainable cash available for distribution;


• | selectively grow our project portfolio and our dividend per Class A share of common stock; and


• | maintain a strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure.

We accomplish our core values and financial objectives through delivering top-tier operating fleet performance, maintaining growth through acquisitions and development from Pattern Development Companies, continuing improvements in business strategy, and maintaining a prudent capital structure and financial flexibility, as discussed further below in "-Our Business Strategy."

Structure of Our Company
Our Operating Business Segment 
Overview
We hold interests in 24 renewable energy projects and operate, on behalf of ourselves and others, an aggregate renewable energy portfolio of approximately 4 GW in the United States, Canada and Japan. Each of such projects use best-in-class equipment from top-tier suppliers and has contracted to sell all or a majority of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed-price PSAs. As a portfolio, as of December 31, 2018, our assets are characterized by: 

• | an approximate 13 year weighted average remaining contract life under our PSAs;


• | 92% of electricity to be generated by our projects will be sold under PSAs;


• | an ‘A-’ weighted average off-taker credit rating; and


• | 4.9-year average age of fleet, primarily using GE and Siemens turbines.

We seek to own high quality projects that have gone through a rigorous review prior to construction. As a result, and in order to meet our own investment targets and our lenders' financing criteria, our projects generally have the following characteristics:

• | multiple years of on-site wind and solar data tied to one or more long-term wind and solar energy reference sources;


• | long-term contractually secured real estate property and easement rights;


• | right to firm interconnection to the electricity grid;


• | all requisite construction and operating permits and regulatory approvals;

8


• | fixed-price turbine supply and construction contracts with guaranteed completion dates;


• | an operations and maintenance service program based on on-site personnel and central operations management. See “- Management, Operations, Maintenance and Administration of Projects in which We Have an Owned Interest” below; and


• | safety, environmental and community programs that support the project.

(7) | Projects that are maintained through self-performance of maintenance and service activities.

Management, Operations, Maintenance and Administration of Operating Projects in which We Have an Owned Interest
For each of our projects in the United States and Canada, we provide management, operations and administrative services. This includes management from our 24/7 operations center located in Houston, Texas, and on-site personnel at all facility sites. For our projects in Japan, management, operations and administrative services are provided by an affiliate of GPI, an entity owned by Pattern Development.
Our projects are maintained through:

• | service arrangements with reputable external third-parties;


• | our self-performance of maintenance and service activities; or


• | a combination of both of the above.

At certain projects, as noted above, where we self-perform maintenance and service activities, we maintain long-term turbine manufacturer service arrangements pursuant to which the turbine manufacturer continues to provide routine and corrective maintenance service, but we are responsible for a portion of the maintenance and repairs, including on major component parts. Over time, we expect to increase our operational responsibility, including self-performing maintenance and service work with our own technicians instead of utilizing service providers, which we believe will continue to help us reduce our costs. As service arrangements expire at the facilities where we utilize external third-parties, we intend to determine on a case-by-case basis the most appropriate approach of either entering into new service arrangements with the same or a different external third-party or transitioning to self-performance of maintenance and service activities. 
Our Interest in Pattern Development
Overview
As of December 31, 2018, we own an approximate 29% interest in Pattern Development, a leading developer of renewable energy projects focusing on wind, solar, storage, and transmission with core markets in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Mexico. As discussed below, we have sought to align Pattern Development with our interests to provide us access to a pipeline of projects we have an opportunity to acquire and the benefits of potential higher returns in the upstream business of project development. 
Pattern Development’s Project Development Process
Pattern Development has a development pipeline of more than 10 GW of projects. Pattern Development’s project development business involves the execution of a process which involves a combination of working with financing parties to obtain access to capital, managing capital obtained in a disciplined manner, and applying development experience and expertise to develop a renewable energy opportunity to create value. Pattern Development believes a focus on executing complex projects provides it a competitive advantage. 
Patten Development has established and seeks to maintain relationships with financial institutions to help provide sources of capital. 
Key elements of Pattern Development’s efforts to manage capital obtained in a disciplined manner include: 

• | Selecting good opportunities in which to invest;


• | Minimizing the capital at risk during the early development stages;


• | De-risking projects through long-term offtake contracts and other arrangements so that, during the construction phase, projects have the potential to be sold (if needed) for good development returns; and

11


• | Minimizing the duration of the relatively higher capital outlays that are required once a project has achieved an advanced stage.

Pattern Development has experience and expertise in each of the following areas which it applies as part of its process: origination, negotiation, political and community engagement, permitting, scientific and strategic analysis capabilities, and risk management. Pattern Development also has established and seeks to maintain relationships with key contractors and offtake counterparties. 
Alignment between Us and Pattern Development
We have sought to align Pattern Development’s interests and our interests, including through each of the following arrangements:

• | Our investment in Pattern Development. We have the right, but not the obligation, to make capital commitments of up to $300 million to Pattern Development as a part of an approximately $1 billion of capital commitments which Pattern Development has secured from long-term focused investors. Through February 28, 2019, we have invested a total of $183 million into Pattern Development, representing an approximate 29% ownership interest.

However, as a part of our arrangements with Pattern Development, while we have the right to participate in all future capital calls by Pattern Development, we are not obligated to participate, and while our interest in Pattern Development would be diluted on a proportional basis if we chose not to participate in a capital call, other negative consequences (such as application of a punitive discount to our investment) would not apply. 

• | Project Purchase Rights. Pursuant to contractual arrangements we have with Pattern Development, we have (among other things) a right of first offer with respect to power projects that Pattern Development decides to sell. See also “- Identified ROFO Projects” below.

In the event Pattern Development does not accept the proposal we make under our rights of first offer, Pattern Development is (with limited exceptions) not permitted to sell such project to a third-party unless the price is at least 110% of the offer price we made, and in the event Pattern Development is unable to enter into an agreement to sell such project to a third-party at such clearing price, Pattern Development is obligated to sell such project to us at 96% of our original offer price.

• | Our Executive Officers Oversee the Business Operations of Pattern Development. Under the shared service arrangements discussed further below, our executive officers provide executive management services to Pattern Development. Such executive officers, who are employed and compensated by us, devote such of their time that is prudent to carry out those executive responsibilities.


• | Shared Services Arrangements. Under the MSA, we have shared services arrangements with each of Pattern Development and Pattern Energy Group LP. Such arrangements are intended to allow each of us, Pattern Development, and Pattern Energy Group LP to make their respective personnel available to others in the group to provide certain shared services. Under these arrangements, Pattern Development makes available its personnel to assist us in managing, operating, maintaining, and administering our projects in Japan.

Most of the employees engaged in project development are currently employed by Pattern Energy Group LP; however, under the MSA, each of Pattern Development and us have the right to require such employees to become their or our employees, respectively, who could then continue to provide shared services. Furthermore, even if Pattern Development exercised such right to cause the employees of Pattern Energy Group LP to become its employees, under the MSA, we have the right to cause such employees at Pattern Development to become our employees.
We seek to manage conflicts of interest which arise through these arrangements. Material transactions between us and Pattern Development are subject to our corporate governance guidelines which require prior approval of any such material transaction by the conflicts committee, which is comprised solely of independent members of our board of directors. The conflicts committee retains independent advisors to assist it in consideration of such transactions which may include a financial advisor and outside counsel. Those of our executive officers who have economic interests in Pattern Development do not participate in the negotiation of such transactions.

Our Business Strategy
To achieve our financial objectives while adhering to our core values, we intend to execute the following business strategies:
Deliver Top-Tier Operating Fleet Performance
We intend to efficiently and safely operate our projects to meet projected revenue and cash available for distribution. We expect to maximize the long-term value of our projects by focusing on value-oriented project availability (by ensuring our projects are operational when the wind is strong and PSA prices are at their highest) and by regularly scheduled and preventative maintenance. We believe that good operating performance begins with a long-term maintenance program for our equipment. We also seek to improve performance and lower operating costs by working closely with our equipment vendors and considering contracting with third parties for maintenance, when appropriate. We believe it is important to employ our own personnel in aspects of our business that we deem critical to the value of our projects. We have achieved a historical operating performance track record of more than 97% turbine availability.
Maintain Growth Through Acquisitions and Development
Our strategy for growth is focused on our core markets of the U.S., Canada and Japan. We intend to grow primarily through the acquisition of operational and construction-ready power projects from Pattern Development and three Identified ROFO Projects held by Pattern Energy Group LP. While we intend to prioritize high-quality assets developed by Pattern Development for acquisition, from time-to-time we will consider acquisitions from third parties if they meet our return thresholds and complement our existing portfolio. We believe, however, our ability to have insight into the fundamentals of projects developed by Pattern Development, together with our alignment due to our ownership interest in Pattern Development, would generally make their projects more attractive and less risky to pursue. We expect that projects we may acquire in the future will represent a logical extension of our existing business, and that incremental assumptions of risk in what we pursue will require commensurate expectations of higher returns. As a result, our near-term growth strategy will remain focused on largely contracted cash flows with creditworthy counterparties and operating or in-construction projects.
We expect that our ownership interest in, and aligned interests with, Pattern Development will provide us with the opportunity to acquire projects that Pattern Development develops. However, through our ownership interest in Pattern Development, we can also achieve growth from Pattern Development’s sale of assets to third parties, particularly where our available liquidity is committed to other 
14

acquisitions or investments or where projects are developed outside of our core markets. We believe our ownership interest in Pattern Development provides us greater flexibility to achieve returns while continuing to support Pattern Development in the execution of its business plan. 
From time to time, we may also consider the disposal of a project, particularly if we believe we can utilize funds realized from such a disposal in a more productive manner or generate a higher return on investment.
Continuous Improvements
As part of our continuous business improvement strategy, we look to create an efficient and scalable corporate organization capable of growth. 

• | Efficiency. We seek to improve our margins through the expansion of our self-perform maintenance initiative as service agreements expire at projects, applying technological advances which emerge to deliver incremental efficiencies for turbines or projects such as the retrofit of hardware onto turbines (for example, dinotails), and upgrading software to more efficiently manage high-speed flow through, each at a cost that delivers positive returns over the length of the project.


• | Scale. We also intend to improve our existing assets and business processes to reduce the marginal cost of overhead. We can achieve this through areas such as system enhancements and increased automation. We have implemented new systems as a result of this review which we expect will deliver incremental efficiencies and margin expansion from overhead savings and improved workflow. We intend to continue to manage overhead costs though additional back office optimization.

Maintain a Prudent Capital Structure and Financial Flexibility
We intend to maintain a conservative approach to our capital structure to protect our ability to meet our financial obligations, pay our regular dividends and to fund investments for future growth. Power projects by their nature require significant capital investment, and as a result, we seek to protect our business through careful management of our capital structure.
The foundation of our capital structure is built on project finance arrangements intended to ensure risk segmentation across our large project portfolio, and our practice has been to structure our project finance arrangements comprised of a mix of debt, tax equity and equity to conform to investment grade-like credit standards. Specifically, we seek to structure our project finance arrangements to:

• | match assets with liabilities based on a project’s off-take tenor and currency denomination;


• | fix or hedge project debt on a long-term basis;


• | amortize our third-party project finance capital within the tenor of the off-take arrangement; and


• | apply conservative debt service coverage or tax equity structuring standards.

Our project capital structure is supplemented with a corporate capital layer that primarily relies on equity capital. Our corporate indebtedness is modest, and intended to ensure broad capital access. In addition, our strategic partnership with PSP Investments is intended to expand capital access and improve flexibility in managing capital requirements. See “- Other Key Relationships - PSP Investments” below.
We seek to ensure financial flexibility and stability through our corporate revolving credit facility, maturity staging, minimization of interest rate exposure, and maintenance of our credit ratings. We intend to use our available liquidity strategically, with a priority placed on our available liquidity for committed project acquisitions or investment commitments. Our foreign currency denominated project dividends are further managed through a short-to-long term foreign exchange program. We believe this approach, together with a strategic consideration of project-level financial restructuring and recapitalization opportunities, will contribute to our ability to maintain and, over time, increase our cash available for distribution.    
Work Closely with Our Stakeholders
We believe that close working relationships with our various stakeholders, including suppliers, PSA counterparties, regulators, the local communities where we are located, environmental organizations, as well as with each of the Pattern Development Companies and other developers, allow us to better support our existing projects and will help us access future renewable energy project opportunities.

Industry 
Wind and solar energy are the two fastest growing sources of electricity generation in North America and globally over the past decade, and projections by the International Energy Agency indicate renewable energy will continue to grow at a faster rate than fossil fuels over the next two decades. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, bringing the global total to 540 GW. In 2018, approximately 107 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity was installed worldwide, a 7.5% increase compared to 2017.
The 12th annual report by Lazard on the levelized cost of energy for electricity generating technologies shows a continued decline in the cost of utility-scale wind and solar energy, with unsubsidized costs at or below the marginal costs of conventional generation under certain circumstances. Growth in the industry is largely attributable to the increasing cost competitiveness of renewable energy relative to other power generation technologies and public support for renewable energy driven by energy security and environmental concerns. Falling technology costs and strong public support for renewable energy contributes to the trend of increasing demand from corporate purchasers and state renewable energy programs. Given increased demand, falling costs, and the inherent stability of the cost of renewable energy sources, we believe that our markets present substantial growth opportunities. We require a relatively small share of a large market to meet our growth objectives, and we believe we can achieve growth through the acquisition of operational and construction-ready projects from the Pattern Development Companies and other third parties.
Government Incentives and Tax Credits
Renewable energy sources in the United States have benefited from various federal and state governmental incentives, such as PTCs and ITCs. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, federal PTCs and ITCs for wind energy were extended with a five-year phase down for wind projects commencing construction after December 31, 2014 and before December 31, 2019. Notwithstanding the benefits of the tax incentives, the continued reduction in levelized cost of energy provides an environment in which renewables are expected to be highly competitive relative to conventional generation resources. We expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on these forms of government support.
Our Markets
The United States of America
The United States remains a strong growth market for renewable energy and is the second largest growth market for solar PV in the world, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports generation from wind and solar power plants grew to 9% of total electricity generation in 2018, up from 8% in 2017. The EIA further reports electricity generation supplied by natural gas increased an estimated 3% in 2018, while coal-fired generation declined by 3%. In 2019, the EIA expects approximately 24 GW of new capacity additions and approximately 8 GW of capacity retirements in the electric power sector, with utility-scale capacity additions consisting primarily of wind (46%), natural gas (34%) and solar photovoltaics (18%), and the remaining primarily other renewables and battery storage capacity.
The falling costs of wind and solar technology have contributed to accelerating demand from corporate purchasers. Bloomberg New Energy Finance finds onshore wind to have the lowest levelized cost of electricity range in the U.S. with PV solar not far behind. In 2018, more than 75 corporate renewable energy deals secured more than 6 GW of capacity. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies and 63% of Fortune 100 companies have at least one climate or clean energy target, and at least 22 Fortune 500 companies have committed to meet 100% of their electricity demand with renewable energy purchases. As part of a global initiative, 160 companies have made a commitment to go ‘100% renewable.’
State RPSs continue to drive demand for utility-scale renewable energy. Roughly a 50% increase in renewable energy generation is needed by 2030 to meet state RPS demand, averaging approximately 5 GW of additions per year. More than half of all RPS states have raised their overall RPS targets or carve-outs since initial RPS adoption. In 2018, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey increased their RPS targets, while New York established an offshore wind procurement target and Massachusetts created a clean peak standard that can help incentivize energy storage deployments.
Japan 
The Japanese market is one of the world’s largest electricity markets, with the country ranking fourth in the world for the most clean energy transactions in 2017 and fifth in the world for new renewable capacity installed the same year. Out of a total 254 GW capacity installed at the end of 2017, generating 1,077,421 GWh, onshore wind and utility PV solar accounted for 16% of installed capacity and only 7% of energy generation, representing a large opportunity for deployment of wind and solar. The Japanese government has placed a greater emphasis on the development of renewable resources following the nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011.
16

The Japanese government set a target in 2015 to have 22% to 24% of its generation come from renewable energy by 2030. In 2018, the Japanese government released its Fifth Strategic Energy Plan that unites the 2030 energy targets and a 2050 energy scenario aimed at decarbonization. The plan designates renewable energy as a core foundation of the energy generation mix by 2050. The FIT program established in 2012 that offered fixed-term, fixed-price contracts for up to 20 years to renewable power projects remains in place. While the predetermined fixed-price for large solar projects has been replaced with a reverse auction system, the tariff price for onshore wind power remains predetermined at JPY20 per kWh for this FY2019 but will reduce annually by JPY1 per kWh until FY2020 (ending March 2021), after which it is expected to also be replaced with a reverse auction system. 
In November 2018, the Japanese government passed a new law allowing offshore wind projects to be developed in the open sea outside of port areas. The precise rules and regulations are expected to be finalized by mid-2019. Like solar, the tariff price will be determined through a reverse auction mechanism. Previously awarded offshore projects in port areas will continue to be eligible for the fixed rate of JPY36 per kWh. As such, there remains a strong incentive for continued investment in the Japanese renewables market, particularly for onshore projects and now additionally with offshore projects due to the passage of the new open sea offshore wind law.
Canada and Other
Canadian clean energy policy arises mostly at the provincial level. Ontario remains Canada’s leading market for wind energy with 5,076 MW of installed wind energy generating capacity as of December 2018, accounting for nearly 40% of the country’s total installed capacity. We own 292 MW of installed wind capacity in Ontario and 594 MW in Canada. We are the largest operator of installed wind capacity in the country with 1,529 MW in operational contracts. Growth opportunities exist through provincial renewable energy targets, including Alberta’s new Renewable Electricity Program that is expected to drive development of at least 4 GW of new wind energy capacity by 2030, and Saskatchewan aims to have wind energy meet 30% of its electricity generating capacity by 2030, adding approximately 2 GW of new wind capacity.
While we currently believe we are unlikely to seek to acquire projects in Mexico pursuant to our Project Purchase Rights, Pattern Development continues to develop renewable energy projects in Mexico. In the event of third-party sales, we may realize benefits due to our ownership interest in Pattern Development. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
We are committed to protecting our workforce and the public, to respecting the communities and cultures where we develop and operate projects, and to minimizing our environmental impacts. We have three value statements to emphasize these commitments and each one has an underlying management system - the Safety Management System, the Community Management System, and the Environmental Management System - that provides a programmatic foundation to meeting these commitments. Our sustainability website is located at www.patternenergy.com/invest/sustainability and details more of our environmental, social and governance values and achievements.
Other Key Relationships
Pattern Energy Group LP
Pattern Energy Group LP is a legacy entity that was involved in the original formation of our company. It was also the sponsor entity at the time of our initial public offering and, until 2018, owned an equity interest in our company. We have Project Purchase Rights with Pattern Energy Group LP that are similar to our Project Purchase Rights with Pattern Development, and there are three Pattern Energy Group LP projects that are Identified ROFO Projects. See “- Identified ROFO Projects” above. In addition, together with us and Pattern Development, Pattern Energy Group LP is a party to the MSA. See “- Our Interest in Pattern Development - Alignment of Interest between Us and Pattern Development - Shared Services Arrangements” above. Pattern Energy Group LP has notified us of its intention to wind down operations in an orderly manner after their disposal of the Identified ROFO Projects. While at the beginning of 2018, Pattern Energy Group LP owned approximately 7.5% of our outstanding Class A common stock, Pattern Energy Group LP disposed of such interest in 2018.

PSP Investments
In June 2017, we entered into a strategic joint venture agreement with PSP Investments. The joint venture agreement provides that PSP Investments has the right to co-invest alongside us, up to an aggregate amount of approximately $500 million, in energy projects we may acquire from the Pattern Development Companies, cooperate with us to complete third-party acquisitions (including possibly arranging for or providing bridge loans and construction financing), and we may add a person that has been designated by PSP Investments to our board of directors. This relationship provides us the ability to increase our portfolio with limited capital investment. In 2018, together with PSP Investments, we acquired each of Mont Sainte-Marguerite (MSM) and Stillwater from Pattern Energy Group LP and Pattern Development, respectively. PSP Investments is also an indirect investor in Pattern Development. PSP Investments does not hold voting rights in Pattern Development. Additionally, as of February 22, 2019, PSP Investments holds approximately 9.5% of our outstanding Class A common stock.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we compete with other industry participants by having a high quality portfolio of projects which are positioned to generate stable long-term cash flows with access to low-cost project-level debt and strong stakeholder relationships. Further, we believe our investment in Pattern Development provides us with a source of attractive investment returns, as well as access to a pipeline of acquisition opportunities that because of our Project Purchase Rights are generally not otherwise available to the broader market, unless the project is not attractive to us.
Our business benefits from high quality assets that are broadly diversified across markets, regulatory regimes and counterparties, making it less dependent on performance of single assets or areas. Our operating platform and associated management team provide us with a world class operations platform with experience in how to efficiently run and continuously optimize our operating business. This experience and knowledge in turn is used to facilitate enhanced pricing and improved costing on new assets that are being developed by Pattern Development, thereby creating a continuous cycle of knowledge transfer.
Our management team is highly experienced in renewables development with a good reputation in the industry that has helped to produce many successes in deal execution, financing and development and construction management. 
We compete with other wind and solar power, infrastructure funds and renewable energy companies, as well as conventional power companies, to acquire profitable construction-ready and operating projects. In addition, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state, provincial and local legislatures and administrative agencies.
Customers
We sell our electricity and RECs primarily to local utilities under long-term, fixed-price PPAs or, in limited instances, local liquid ISO markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison Company were our only significant customers representing 12% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue.
Suppliers
There are a limited number of turbine equipment suppliers, including General Electric, Vestas and Siemens-Gamesa; however, we believe that current manufacturing quality and competitive dynamics are strong and that parts and supply capacity is adequate. Our equipment supply strategy is largely based on maintaining strong relationships with leading equipment suppliers to secure our supply needs.
Other important suppliers include global and regional engineering, procurement (EPC) and construction contractors with whom we contract to perform civil engineering, electrical work and other infrastructure construction for our projects.
While we do self-perform some turbine service and maintenance activities, a significant amount of our service work is currently performed by the original equipment manufacturers, primarily Siemens-Gamesa and General Electric, as well as other qualified independent service providers. All our service providers are generally well recognized in the renewable service business. While we expect over time to increase self-perform activities, we do expect to continue to utilize both original equipment manufacturers and qualified independent service companies for a substantial amount of our service and maintenance needs. See “- Our Operating Projects - Management, Operations, Maintenance and Administration of Our Operating Projects” above.

Regulatory Matters 
Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:
U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
Our current projects in operation in the United States are operating as Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended, (PUHCA) and therefore are exempt from certain regulation under PUHCA. Certain of our operating projects in the United States are, however, public utilities under the Federal Power Act subject to rate regulation by FERC. Future projects in the United States will also likely be subject to such rate regulation once they are placed into service. Our projects in the United States that are subject to FERC rate regulation are required to obtain acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of energy (i.e., not retail sales to consumers), capacity and ancillary services, including their ability to charge “market-based rates.”
Independent System Operators (ISOs)
Most of our North American projects are located in regions in which the wholesale electric markets are administered by ISOs and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). 
North American Electric Reliability Corporation
All of our current operating projects located in North America are also subject to the reliability standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). If we fail to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. 
Regulatory Matters - Canada
All of our current operating projects in Canada are subject to exclusive provincial regulatory authority with respect to the generation and production of electricity, which varies across provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are mostly regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilities must be licensed by the Ontario Energy Board and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.
Regulatory Matters - Japan
All of our current operating projects in Japan are governed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). METI has administrative jurisdiction and is the authority that grants licenses to transmission and distribution operators, administers the registration of retailers, and the filings of power generators. The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission was established by the METI to conduct monitoring of the electricity market and enforces strict regulations to ensure neutrality of the electricity market. The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, a part of the METI, is responsible for Japan's policies regarding energy and natural resources.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are required to comply with various environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These existing and future laws and regulations may impact existing and new projects, require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and implement environmental programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted energy assets, all of which involve a significant investment of time and resources. Existing initiatives and rules, some of which could potentially have a material effect (either positive or negative) on us, are as follows: 
19

Avian/Bat Regulations and Wind Turbine Siting Guidelines
We are subject to numerous environmental regulations and guidelines related to threatened and endangered species and their habitats, as well as avian and bat species, for the ongoing operations of our facilities. Environmental laws in the U.S., including the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act as well as similar environmental laws in Canada (such as the federal Species at Risk Act and the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007), among others, provide for the protection of migratory birds, eagles and bats and endangered species of birds and bats and their habitats. In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the U.S. while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats.
Regulation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
The U.S. Congress and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as finalizing regulation or setting targets and goals, regarding the reduction of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. 
Environmental Matters— Domestic
We are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals to build and operate our projects, including, but not limited to, those described below from U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities. In addition to being subject to these regulatory requirements, we could experience and have experienced significant opposition from third parties when we initially apply for permits or when there is an appeal proceeding after permits are issued. The delay or denial of a permit or the imposition of conditions that are costly or difficult to comply with can impair or even prevent the development of a project or can increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us.
Federal Clean Water Act
Frequently, our U.S. projects are located near wetlands, and we are required to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams. The Clean Water Act also requires that we mitigate any loss of wetland functions and values that accompanies our activities, obtain permits under the Clean Water Act for water discharges, such as storm water runoff associated with construction activities, and to follow a variety of best management practices to ensure that water quality is protected and impacts are minimized. 
Federal Bureau of Land Management Permits
As some of our U.S. projects are located on lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, we are required to obtain rights-of-way from the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau of Land Management encourages the development of wind power within acceptable areas, consistent with Environmental Policy Act of 2005 and the Bureau of Land Management’s energy and mineral policy. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Our U.S. projects may also be subject to environmental review under the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all "major federal actions" significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a land lease, a federal permit or similar authorization for a major development project, or the interconnection of a significant private project into a federal project generally is considered a "major federal action" that requires review under NEPA. As part of the NEPA review, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife, historical and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics and alternatives to the project. A federal agency may decide to deny a permit based on its environmental review under NEPA, though in most cases a project would be redesigned to reduce impacts or agree to provide some form of mitigation to offset impacts before a denial is issued.
National Historic Preservation Act
U.S. federal agencies consider a project’s impact on historical or archeological resources under the U.S. National Historic Preservation Act and may require us to conduct archeological surveys or take other measures to protect these resources. The National Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies to evaluate the impact of all federally funded or permitted projects on historic properties (buildings, archaeological sites, etc.)
20

Other State and Local Programs
In addition to federal requirements, our U.S. projects, and any future U.S. projects we may acquire, are subject to a variety of state environmental review and permitting requirements. Many states where our projects are located, or may in the future be located, have laws that require state agencies to evaluate a broad array of environmental impacts before granting state permits. The state environmental review process often resembles the federal NEPA process and may be more stringent than the federal review. Our projects also often require state law based permits in addition to federal permits. 
Our projects also are subject to local environmental and regulatory requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling and measurement of permissible sound levels in connection with the permitting and approval of our projects. Local or state agencies also may require us to develop decommissioning plans for dismantling the project at the end of its functional life and establish financial assurances for carrying out the decommissioning plan.
Environmental Matters—Canada
We are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals to build and operate our Canadian projects, including, but not limited to, those described below from applicable Canadian federal, provincial, First Nations and municipal governmental authorities. In addition to being subject to these regulatory requirements, we could experience opposition from third parties, including, but not limited to, environmental non-governmental organizations, neighborhood groups, municipalities and First Nations when the permits were initially applied for or when there is an appeal proceeding after permits are issued. The delay or denial of a permit or the imposition of conditions that are costly or difficult to comply with can impair or even prevent the development of a project or can increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us.
Ontario Renewable Energy Approvals
Projects in Ontario are generally subject to Ontario’s Environmental Protection Act, which requires proponents of significant renewable energy projects to obtain a Renewable Energy Approval (REA). The REA application requires a variety of studies on environmental, archeological and heritage issues. Significant public consultation, as well as consultation with indigenous communities, is also required. Before issuing a REA, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MOECP) evaluates a broad range of potential impacts, including on wildlife, wetlands and water resources, communities, scenic areas, species and heritage resources, as well as impacts on people. This review can be time consuming and expensive, and an approval can be rejected or approved with conditions that are costly or difficult to comply with. REAs are also subject to appeal by third parties and can result and have resulted in lengthy appeal tribunal hearings. An exception to the requirement to obtain a REA permit as described above exists where the proposed project is being developed, constructed, and operated on federal reserve lands under the jurisdiction of a First Nation. In this circumstance, the First Nation may impose an environmental protection regime which would closely mirror the REA process, but it would be administered and monitored for compliance by the First Nation as opposed to MOECP.
Quebec Environmental Impact Assessment
Quebec`s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a required permit for wind energy projects with a nameplate capacity above 10 MW. The EIA requires a variety of studies related to environmental, archeological and heritage issues. Significant public consultation, as well as consultation with indigenous communities, is also required. The culmination of this permitting process is the issuing of a project specific decree by the provincial council of ministers which may include conditions related to the construction and operation of a project that may be costly or difficult to comply with. Before issuing the decree, the Quebec Ministry of Environment evaluates a broad range of potential impacts, including on wildlife, wetlands and water resources, communities, scenic areas, species and heritage resources, as well as impacts on people. 
Quebec Commission for the Protection of Agricultural Land
In addition to the EIA process, the other major permit in Quebec is granted by the Quebec Commission for the Protection of Agricultural Land. This permit is only required on land that is zoned agricultural. This permitting body may impose conditions on proponents to minimize footprints during both the construction phase and the operations phase. 
Manitoba Environment Act
The Manitoba Environment Act requires proponents of significant projects to submit a proposal with the Manitoba Conservation Environmental Assessment & Licensing Branch, and to comply with Manitoba’s environmental assessment process under the Environment 
21

Act. This process will consider a similar range of impacts on the environment, the heritage and scenic values of an area and on people, communities and wildlife as the Ontario process, and brings with it similar risks.
British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act
When a major project is proposed in British Columbia, it must undergo an environmental assessment (EA) process. This process ensures that any potential environmental, economic, social, heritage and health effects that may occur during the lifetime of a major project are thoroughly assessed. The EA process is managed by the Environmental Assessment Office (EAO), a regulatory agency within the provincial government that works with and seeks input from environmental scientists, indigenous groups, proponents, the public, local governments, and federal and provincial agencies to ensure adverse effects are considered.
The EAO follows a defined process in the Environmental Assessment Act to conduct the assessment of a major project. The outcome of the process is the preparation of a detailed Assessment Report which is reviewed by the province for a determination as to whether the proposed project should proceed.
Endangered Species Legislation
Our Canadian renewable energy projects may be subject to endangered species legislation, either federally or provincially, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for harming endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Our projects may also be subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, which protects the habitat of migratory species, and which may also trigger federal "Species at Risk" requirements. Because the operation of wind turbines may result in injury or fatalities to birds and bats, avian and bat risk assessments are generally required both prior to permits being issued for projects and after commercial operations. Permits, authorizations or agreements may also be required under federal or provincial endangered species legislation if any species that are listed as endangered or threatened, or their habitats, are affected.
Other Approvals
Our Canadian projects, and any future projects we may acquire, are subject to a variety of other federal, provincial and municipal permitting and zoning requirements. Most provinces where our projects are located or may be located have laws that require provincial agencies to evaluate a broad array of environmental impacts before granting permits and approvals. These agencies evaluate similar issues as the permitting regimes above, including impact on wildlife, historic sites, aesthetics, wetlands and water resources, scenic areas, endangered and threatened species and communities. In addition, federal government approvals dealing with, among other things, aeronautics, fisheries, navigation or species protection may be required and could in some cases trigger additional environmental assessment requirements. Additional requirements related to the permitting of transmission lands may be applicable in some cases. Our projects are also subject to certain municipal requirements, including land use and zoning requirements, as well as requirements for building permits and other municipal approvals that can be difficult or costly to comply with and impair or prevent the development of a project.
Environmental Matters - Japan 
We are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals from various governmental agencies in Japan, including at the prefectural and municipal level, to develop, construct and operate our projects, including, but not limited to, the items described below. 
Ministry of the Environment
The Ministry of the Environment is a Cabinet-level ministry within the government of Japan that is responsible for domestic and global environmental conservation, pollution control and nature conservation. 
Environmental Impact Assessment Law
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law is applied to wind power projects that may significantly impact the environment. Depending on the size of the project, an environmental impact assessment would be required by the project owner prior to development with the intent of incorporating environmental considerations into the project design. 
22

Management, Disposal and Remediation of Hazardous Substances
We own and lease real property and may be subject to requirements regarding the storage, use and disposal of petroleum products and hazardous substances, including spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements. If our owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to our ownership or operation, we could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. That responsibility may arise even if we were not at fault and did not cause or were not aware of the contamination. In addition, waste we generate is at times sent to third-party disposal facilities. If those facilities become contaminated, we and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims for damage to third parties, their property or natural resources.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 209 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
