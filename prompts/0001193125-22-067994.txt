Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 1, 2021 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies, as more fully described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 
Initial Public Offering and Private Placement 
 On March 8, 2021, our sponsor was issued 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate price of $25,000. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 750,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to forfeiture by our sponsor to the extent that the over-allotment option held by the underwriter of our initial public offering was not exercised in full or in part, so that our sponsor would own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering (excluding the private placement shares (as defined below) and assuming our sponsor did not purchase any public shares in our initial public offering, which it did not). The underwriter fully exercised the over-allotment option on May 28, 2021; thus, these 750,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. 
 On May 28, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 23,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, including 3,000,000 shares of Class A common stock that were issued pursuant to the underwriter’s exercise, in full, of its over-allotment option, at $10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 715,500 shares of Class A common stock (the “private placement shares”) at a price of $10.00 per share in a private placement to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $7,155,000. 
 Business Combination Agreement – Proposed Business Combination with Senti Biosciences, Inc. 
 On December 19, 2021, we entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Explore Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and Senti Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Senti”). The Business Combination Agreement provides, among other things, that on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Senti, with Senti surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). Upon the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), the Company will change its name to “Senti Biosciences, Inc.” and its ticker symbol on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) is expected to change to “SNTI.” The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the “Closing Date.” The proposed business combination with Senti was announced in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2021. 
 The Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company and Senti. We intend to effectuate our proposed initial business combination with Senti using a combination of cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (and the concurrent private placement of the private placement shares), the proceeds of the sale of our shares to private investors in connection with our initial business combination and shares issued to the owners of Senti, as described below. 
 Under the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Senti in exchange for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), based on an implied equity value for Senti of $240,000,000, to be paid to Senti stockholders and option holders at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”). In addition, Senti stockholders will have the right to receive (i) an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock if, after Closing, the volume weighted average price of the Class A

  PART I 
 
Common Stock on the Nasdaq, or any other national securities exchange on which the shares of Class A Common Stock are then traded (“VWAP”), is greater than or equal to $15.00 over any 20 trading days within any consecutive 30 trading day period, in the period that ends on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock if, after Closing, the VWAP is greater than or equal to $20.00 over any 20 trading days within any consecutive 30 trading day period, in the period that ends on the third anniversary of the Closing Date. 
 Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the Effective Time, each option exercisable for Senti equity that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent the right to purchase Senti equity and shall be converted into an option to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as applied to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to adjustments to exercise price and number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise, changes for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the related transaction documents and immaterial administrative changes as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors. 
 The parties to the Business Combination Agreement have agreed to customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. In addition, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement agreed to be bound by certain customary covenants for transactions of this type, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of Senti, the Company and their respective subsidiaries during the period between execution of the Business Combination Agreement and Closing. The representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the parties set forth in the Business Combination Agreement will terminate at Closing, except for those covenants and agreements that, by their terms, contemplate performance after Closing, and certain representations and warranties, as noted in the Business Combination Agreement. Each of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary to consummate and expeditiously implement the Merger. 
 Under the Business Combination Agreement, the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, without limitation: (i) the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders and Senti’s stockholders; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the absence of a continuing Company Material Adverse Effect or DYNS Material Adverse Effect (each as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) since the date of the Business Combination Agreement; (iv) after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the Company would have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of the Merger; (v) the Company’s initial listing application with Nasdaq in connection with the Merger has been approved and, immediately following the Effective Time, the Company is able to satisfy the applicable initial and continuing listing requirements of Nasdaq and the shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock have been approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject only to official notice of the issuance thereof; and (vi) the registration statement filed by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and as required by, the Business Combination Agreement, the first draft of which was filed with the SEC on Form S-4 on February 14, 2022 (the “Registration Statement”), has become effective, no stop order has been issued by the SEC and remains in effect with respect to the Registration Statement, and no proceeding seeking such a stop order has been threatened or initiated by the SEC and remains pending. In addition, Senti’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to the condition that the Available Closing Cash (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) shall be greater than or equal to $150,000,000. Because the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of these (and other) conditions, there is no guarantee that the Merger will be consummated. 
 On February 12, 2022, the Business Combination Agreement was amended by the parties thereto (the “Business Combination Agreement Amendment”) to reflect, among other things, (i) a correction to section 5.7 of the Business Combination Agreement, and (ii) changes to the options Senti granted to certain persons at the time the Business Combination Agreement was signed.

 Business Strategy 
 We believe that the life sciences subsector is undergoing a dramatic transformation due to broad-scale availability of disruptive foundational technologies which enable significant improvements in diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and prediction of health and disease, at an accelerated pace. The pace of innovation is unprecedented throughout history, and we do not see the pace of this innovation subsiding. As a result, the ability to better understand biology – and harness it to diagnose and treat disease – is driving the creation of new markets and the disruption of existing markets throughout the life sciences field. Our focus is on opportunities across the emerging healthcare value chains being created by disruptive technologies, including life sciences tools, enabling-software, synthetic biology and novel drug discovery and development platforms that enable applications in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and advanced bio-materials. We aim to find a disruptive target company and help accelerate value faster than otherwise achievable as a stand-alone company pursuing a traditional IPO path. 
 We believe that certain life sciences companies will see material benefits from being publicly traded, including greater access to capital and attracting and retaining talent. Based on our management team’s experience as active participants in private financings and subsequent IPOs, we believe we can provide an acquisition target with a more efficient path to going public with a known investor syndicate and an acquisition price negotiated upfront. 
 Our collective network of contacts and deep relationships across industry, academia and the investment community is unique. Value inflection and acceleration of technological development is, of course, not simply about capital, but connectivity and collective wisdom. We intend to contribute to a target company so that it realizes more value, including by potentially helping such company achieve collaborations, gain new strategic guidance, extend its platform into new end markets, and/or expand the quality of its investor syndicate. 
 Our Founders 
 Our sponsor team has a long history of working together with combined decades of experience across multiple complementary areas: (1) innovating, founding, building and scaling world-class organizations as executives and directors of public and private companies, creating billions of dollars in shareholder value; (2) identifying, vetting, investing in, incubating and positioning novel scientific breakthroughs and partnering with management teams to help them execute on their visions; (3) maintaining a deep understanding of the market and having the vision and foresight to develop new end markets based on disruptive products across the life sciences subsector; and (4) raising capital for emerging companies with transformative life sciences technologies. 
 Our management team and board of directors consist of our Executive Chair, Omid Farokhzad, MD, who is currently Founder, CEO, and Chair of Seer, Inc. (Nasdaq: SEER); our Chief Executive Officer, Mostafa Ronaghi, PhD, who was most recently Chief Technology Officer of Illumina (Nasdaq: ILMN); our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Afrasiabi, CFA, most recently Senior Partner at Silver Rock Financial, L.P.; our Chief Business Officer, Rowan Chapman, PhD, a seasoned venture capital investor across the life sciences subsector; our independent director Jay Flatley, who served as CEO of Illumina from June 1999 to March 2016 and Chairman until March 2021; our independent director David

  PART I 
 
Epstein, formerly CEO of Novartis Pharmaceuticals; and our independent director Deep Nishar, currently Managing Director at General Catalyst. We also have a Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Robert Langer, who is currently one of twelve Institute Professors at MIT. We believe that the strong scientific, entrepreneurial, investment and management backgrounds of our management, directors and advisor—coupled with a deep network across industry, academia and the investment community—will enable us to identify a disruptive acquisition target that can thrive as a public company. 
 For further information on our management team and board of directors, please refer to “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” of this Annual Report. 
 Competitive Advantages 
 Technological innovation is disrupting many markets across the life sciences subsector from basic discovery and translational research to novel diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics and advanced bio-materials. We believe our management team is well positioned to identify opportunities for the reasons outlined below: 
 

• | Track record of success: Members of our management team have established long-term track records as operating executives, scientists, company founders, and investment professionals in the life sciences subsector, and have founded and/or invested in numerous successful, innovative biotechnology and life sciences tools companies. Executive Chair, Dr. Omid Farokhzad, M.D., is founder, CEO and Chair of transformative proteomics platform, Seer, which he led to a successful IPO in December 2020. He previously co-founded BIND Therapeutics (acquired by Pfizer), Selecta Biosciences (Nasdaq: SELB) and Tarveda Therapeutics. CEO and Director, Mostafa Ronaghi, PhD, was most recently Chief Technology Officer, Senior Vice President and member of the Executive Leadership Team at Illumina (Nasdaq: ILMN) from 2008-2021. While at Illumina, in 2016, Dr. Ronaghi also co-founded GRAIL, a next-gen liquid biopsy platform for cancer detection.

• | Deep relationships across the life sciences and pharmaceutical ecosystem: Our management team, directors and advisors maintain extensive relationships with senior business development and R&D leadership executives across the life sciences and pharmaceutical ecosystem, as well as with leading academics and major investment funds focused on the life sciences. We believe that our team has developed a reputation for being trusted advisors to entrepreneurs and companies across the life sciences value chain, which we believe will facilitate investment opportunities in these companies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proactive and proprietary transaction sourcing: We believe our management team has access to high-quality deal flow, due in large part to their broad range of industry contacts and the reputation of our management team, directors and scientific advisor. We expect our team’s reputation for having deep industry expertise will also attract referrals from industry colleagues. Many of these companies may be less well-known and may represent a landscape of investment opportunities uniquely accessible to our team.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant value-add capability: We believe that our team’s blend of operating and investment experience can help companies maximize their potential value. We aim to find a target that we believe would achieve more value from partnering with us than by pursuing the traditional IPO path, by leveraging the collective business, scientific, financial, intellectual property, recruiting and deal-making advice of our team. Our management team, board of directors and scientific advisor collectively have decades of experience founding, and then growing and managing, companies and taking them from private markets to the public market. The team also has experience crafting strategic partnerships with industry-leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies. Our team is also interested in potential opportunities with which one or more members of our team or directors could take a board seat in the company following the initial business combination, if feasible and mutually beneficial to our team and the target.

  PART I 
 

• | Broad vision, exceptional network and deep domain expertise to facilitate the identification and diligence of opportunities: We believe our management team and directors possess a unique combination of attributes, from having a broad view of key trends in life sciences technological developments and the emerging healthcare value-chain, to a deep understanding of key technological and scientific nuances, which should allow us to better vet technology platforms, identify appropriate expertise and achieve a thorough level of diligence of a target company. Due to our broad industry and academic networks, we may see opportunities and synergies even before the target company’s management or board does.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad experience across private and public markets: Our team has experience leading large, publicly traded corporations at the board and executive levels, which could open the door to many companies not yet envisioning an IPO. The team’s collective experience could assist in transitioning a high-quality, privately-held company to the public market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Criteria and Acquisition Process 
 Consistent with our business strategy discussed above and the expertise of our team, we have identified the following general criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses, although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet all of these criteria: 

• | compelling risk/reward proposition;
--+------------------------------------


• | grounded in breakthrough science (i.e., first-in-class or best-in-class competitive positioning);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential market leading product(s);
--+-------------------------------------


• | addressing an unmet medical need;
--+----------------------------------


• | providing significant benefits to patients;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | multiple assets with the ability to diversify risk and successfully navigate an economic downturn, changes in the industry landscape, social sustainability trends and the evolving regulatory environment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IPO-ready management team; and
--+-------------------------------


• | experienced investor base: companies that have been funded by experienced life sciences investors including venture capitalists, private equity investors, healthcare companies and other institutional investors who have also provided strategic input to the company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our acquisition and diligence process for each potential target will include: 
 

• | scientific and technological analysis, with assessment of product development, commercial, clinical, regulatory and reimbursement success factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of market factors such as size, growth opportunity, competition, and development trends;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | full review of proprietary technology content and intellectual property;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commercial review, including interviews with key opinion leaders, customers, competitors and industry experts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | financial evaluation, including analysis of historical results and modeling of various scenarios; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review and evaluation of operations including R&D, manufacturing, sales, and distribution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



10 

  PART I 
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination, including our proposed initial business combination with Senti, may be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or scientific advisor (although Senti is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or scientific advisor). In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or scientific advisor, we, or a committee of independent directors, to the extent required by applicable law or based upon the direction of our board of directors or a committee thereof, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or scientific advisor may directly or indirectly own our common stock and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officer or director is made a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, or may in the future have, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. Our officers and directors would continue to be subject to all other fiduciary duties owed to us and our stockholders and no other waivers of their respective fiduciary obligations have been provided. We do not have any plan for any waiver of the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors post-business combination. 
 Our officers, directors, scientific advisor and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, and, in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various sources, including our global networks, as well as other sources such as investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis. Our sponsor, officers and directors and their respective affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have. 
 
11 

  PART I 
 
While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the Company prior to, or in connection with, any services rendered in order to effectuate the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is, including the proposed initial business combination with Senti, which is described elsewhere in this Report). 
 Although none of our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination (including the proposed initial business combination with Senti). The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 
 As noted above, we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors (although Senti is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors). In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, to the extent required by applicable law or based upon the direction of our board of directors or a committee thereof, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 As also noted above, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 
 Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using a combination of cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering, the proceeds of the placement of the private placement shares, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target and debt issued to banks or other lenders or the owners of the target. Our intended funding sources for our proposed initial business combination with Senti are described above. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 
12 

  PART I 
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity (as is the case with the proposed initial business combination with Senti) or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination (if any), to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (as is the case with the proposed initial business combination with Senti), and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement shares and may, as a result, be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination (as is the case with the proposed initial business combination with Senti, whereby private investors will subscribe for shares of our Class A Common Stock concurrently with the Merger). Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination (including the Registration Statement) will disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we will seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets, including in respect of our proposed initial business combination with Senti. 
 The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction (including the Registration Statement) will provide public stockholders with confirmation of our board of directors’ satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test, or, if our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) (and in the case of the proposed initial business combination with Senti, we will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Senti). If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. 
 

13 

  PART I 
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating any prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and key employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information made available to us. 
 Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business (including Senti) with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination (including our proposed initial business combination with Senti), the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business which may operate or exist only in a single industry. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to acquire multiple businesses. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity (which potentially operates or exists only in a single industry), our lack of diversification may subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments post-transaction, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry or industries in which we operate after our initial business combination and cause us to depend on the development, marketing and sale of a limited number of products or services. 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rules, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their respective affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We do not currently 
 
14 

  PART I 
 
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination (as is the case for our proposed initial business combination with Senti), where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination, which may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A Common Stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom they may pursue privately negotiated purchases (if any) by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase public shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination or Certain Stockholder Votes to Amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock upon (i) the completion of our initial business combination, or (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. Such redemptions, if any, will be made at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, in the case of such redemptions), including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise 
 
15 

  PART I 
 
and income taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting fees we will pay to the underwriter of our initial public offering. The redemption rights include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its public shares. Our sponsor and each of our officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares or private placement shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination or a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions in Conjunction With a Stockholder Vote on Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirements. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval (as is the case with our proposed initial business combination with Senti), we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting fees (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
 
16 

  PART I 
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------


In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement they entered into with us, our sponsor and each of our officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, private placement shares and any public shares they hold in favor of our initial business combination (including our proposed initial business combination with Senti). For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, assuming all outstanding shares of common stock are voted, in addition to the Founder Shares and private placement shares, we would need only 8,267,251, or approximately 35.9%, of the 23,000,000 public shares to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have it approved. Assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted, in addition to the Founder Shares and the private placement shares, we would need only 900,876, or approximately 3.9%, of the 23,000,000 public shares to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have it approved.1 These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against our proposed business combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting fees (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption, plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination, exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.

  PART I 
 
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash (as is the case for our proposed initial business combination with Senti). However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initial vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which may include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its public shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have, from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and holders can simply check a box on the proxy card indicating that they wish to exercise their redemption rights. After the initial business combination is approved, the company contacts the holder 
 
18 

  PART I 
 
to arrange for them to deliver their certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder has an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which they can monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rises above the redemption price, they can sell their shares in the open market before actually delivering their shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivers its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem public shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivers its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their public shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their public shares. 
 If a proposed initial business combination (including our proposed initial business combination with Senti) is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such 24 month period we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 Our sponsor and each of our officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any Founder Shares and private placement shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers or directors acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24 month time period. 
 
19 

  PART I 
 
In addition, our sponsor and each of our officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to the letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or (ii) with respect to any material provision relating to public stockholders’ rights unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A Common Stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting fees (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement described above, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement shares, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our public stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
 Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver, or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP (“Marcum”), our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriter of our initial public offering, have not executed agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 
 
20 

  PART I 
 
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share, and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust account assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations. None of our officers, directors or members of our sponsor will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share, or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust account assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors, in exercising their business judgment, may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. As noted above, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price would not be less than $10.00 per public share. 

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. We have access to funds outside the trust account of approximately $889,323 as at December 31, 2021 with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, public stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors; however, such liability would not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such public stockholder. 
   
21 

  PART I 
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 As noted above, if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention, if we have not completed our initial business combination, to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the aforementioned procedures under the DGCL. As such, our public stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them from the trust account (but no more) and any liability of our public stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of our dissolution. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time, that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations have been and will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor is liable to indemnify us to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share, or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust account assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and without being liable in respect of any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed trust account waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of such waiver for such third-party claims. 
 If the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then, pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution instead of three years in the case of a liquidating distribution.

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our public stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by public stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our public stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to public stockholders’ rights or pre- initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of 65% of our common stock. Our initial stockholders (including our sponsor), who collectively beneficially own approximately 21.9% of our common stock, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

• | if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public

stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law;

• | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account, or (ii) vote on our initial business combination or any pre- initial business combination activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | although we do not intend to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors (and the target for our proposed initial business combination, Senti, is not affiliated with such persons), we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will, to the extent required by applicable law or based upon the direction of our board of directors or a committee thereof, obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view;

• | if a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rules and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; whether or not we maintain our registration under the our Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above;

• | our initial business combination must occur with one or more businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on income earned in the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination;

In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting commissions.

  PART I 
 
Competition 
 If we do not consummate our proposed initial business combination with Senti, in identifying, evaluating and selecting another target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation may give others with greater resources an advantage in pursuing a business combination with a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us to complete our initial business combination (including the proposed business combination with Senti) and may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating another initial business combination, should the proposed initial business combination with Senti not be consummated. 
Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination (including the proposed initial business combination with Senti). The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any other full- or part-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

These financial statements will be prepared in accordance with GAAP and audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
