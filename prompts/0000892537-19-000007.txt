Our Employees
Our customer's success is the end result of the hard work of our talented and dedicated employees.  At year end, our workforce consisted of approximately 7,800 employees, 69% of whom hold security clearances and approximately 47% of whom are veterans.  
Our Customers
We derive the vast majority of our revenues from U.S. government customers. We have successful, long-standing relationships with these customers, having supported many of them for almost half a century. For each of the last three years we have derived 98% of our annual revenues from our U.S. government customers, with at least 73% of our revenues each such year from intelligence 
6

and defense customers. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2018, our backlog was $8.4 billion, of which $1.3 billion was funded backlog. At December 31, 2017, our backlog was $7.1 billion, of which $1.4 billion was funded backlog. We expect that approximately 23% of our total backlog will be recognized as revenue prior to December 31, 2019.
We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contracts. We also include an estimate of revenue for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which there are established patterns of revenues.
We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and allocated to the contract by the purchasing agency or otherwise authorized for payment by the customer upon completion of a specified portion of work. Our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds for a particular program or contract on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance over a much longer period of time.
A variety of circumstances or events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, the extension of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, the early termination of contracts, and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts. Changes in the amount of our funded backlog also are affected by the funding cycles of the government.
Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses
We own a limited number of patents. We also maintain a number of trademarks and service marks to identify and distinguish the goods and services we offer. While we protect our patents, marks, trade secrets and vital confidential information, our business does not depend on the existence or protection of such intellectual property.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal. However, in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before September 30, which is the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year (GFY). Additionally, our quarterly results are impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. There are generally fewer working days for our employees to generate revenues in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. 
Business Environment and Competitive Landscape
Our primary customer is the U.S. government, the largest consumer of services and solutions in the U.S. In U.S. GFY 2018, the U.S. government obligated approximately $333 billion on contracted services, an 8% increase from the prior year. Our principal focus is on the national security and defense of the U.S. homeland. The DoD is the largest purchaser of services and solutions in the U.S. government and with the U.S. GFY 2020 budget request of $701 billion, it accounts for approximately 58% of the total discretionary budget. The DoD has experienced five years of consecutive budget growth. Additionally, Budget Control Act Caps (BCAC) were raised by $80 billion in U.S. GFY 2018 and $85 billion in U.S. GFY 2019 as a result of the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The DoD appropriations for U.S. GFY 2018 and U.S. GFY 2019 resulted in 8% and 3% growth year-over-year, respectively.
We compete in a market shaped by customer requirements and federal budget priorities and constraints. Our key competitors currently include divisions of large defense contractors, as well as a number of large and mid-size U.S. government contractors with specialized capabilities. Because of the diverse requirements of U.S. government customers and the highly competitive nature of large procurements, we frequently collaborate with these and other companies to compete for large contracts and we bid against these companies in other situations. 
The budget environment continued to improve and grow in 2018, following several years of budget constraints and uncertain funding levels. Congressional actions have alleviated much of the potential impact of sequestration historically but BCAC remain longer term. The majority of our customers are fully funded for the fiscal year, however a handful are currently operating under a Continuing Resolution as Congress works to finalize the details of a bipartisan budget comprise, which would provide visibility 
7

into funding and spending levels for the U.S. GFY 2020 and U.S. GFY 2021 substantially above the BCAC. The improved budget clarity resulted in our customers making more award decisions and procuring services to meet mission needs on a more regular and predictable basis. We also believe that our customers' use of lowest price/technically acceptable procurements, which contributed to pricing pressures and lower margins in prior years, has leveled off or been reduced by some customers. Under the current Administration, we believe the defense budget outlook has improved meaningfully and we expect defense spending increases relative to prior years.
The Administration has cited significant global threats, readiness and force structure needs within the military, diplomatic, homeland and border security, and cyber aggressions by both state and non-state actors, as priorities in establishing federal policy and budgets. Although the Administration's priorities will be subject to Congressional debate, we believe that the U.S. government's spending will remain robust in key areas that we are well positioned to serve, including national and homeland security programs, cyber security, sophisticated intelligence gathering and information sharing activities.
