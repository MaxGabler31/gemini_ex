ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Stem, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a large, digitally connected, intelligent energy storage network provider, providing our customers (i) with an energy storage system, sourced from leading, global battery original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), that we deliver through our partners, including solar project developers and engineering, procurement and construction firms and (ii) through our Athena® artificial intelligence (“AI”) platform (“Athena”), with ongoing software-enabled services to operate the energy storage systems for up to 20 years. In addition, in all the markets where we operate our customers’ systems, we have agreements to manage the energy storage systems using our Athena platform to participate in energy markets and to share the revenue from such market participation. 
We deliver our battery hardware and software-enabled services to our customers through our Athena platform. Our hardware and recurring software-enabled services mitigate customer energy costs through time-of-use and demand charge management innovations and a network of virtual power plants. The resulting network created by our growing customer base is designed to increase grid resilience and reliability through the real-time processing of market-based demand cycles, energy prices and other factors in connection with the deployment of renewable energy resources to such customers. Additionally, our energy storage solutions support renewable energy generation by alleviating grid intermittency issues and thereby reducing customer dependence on traditional, fossil fuel resources. As of December 31, 2021, Athena had accumulated more than 25.9 million runtime hours, which is equivalent to more than 2,900 years of operational experience, across hundreds of sites and customers in several utility territories across the U.S., Canada and Chile. 
We believe that energy storage, which can instantly provide grid power 24x7, is a critical component of the global transition to renewable energy and a distributed energy infrastructure. As a result, there is rising demand for clean electric power solutions that can provide electric power with lower carbon emissions and high availability. One such solution is distributed, renewable generation, which is supplementing and replacing conventional generation sources, given its increasingly compelling economics. According to a September 23, 2020 report from Wood Mackenzie Energy Storage Service (“Wood Mackenzie”), since 2019, 90% of the new interconnection requests in the U.S. electrical markets were for installations of renewable energy assets. However, one of the principal challenges affecting the increased development of renewable energy assets is the intermittent capacity that solar and wind generation exhibit when integrating into electrical power networks. Energy storage helps mitigate intermittency by acting as an energy reserve in times when wind and solar generation is reduced, unavailable or offline, which is why as of November 21, 2021 Bloomberg New Energy Finance (“BNEF”) forecasted energy storage solutions and services to represent a $1.2 trillion revenue opportunity on a cumulative basis through 2050. 
The transition to renewable energy and a distributed energy infrastructure has resulted in an increase in the complexity and variability of end-customer electricity demand influenced by onsite generation and flexible sources of load. Accordingly, it has become nearly impossible to efficiently manage and operate businesses and the grid using a schedule based, human operated approach. Instead, the utilization of intelligent, responsive energy storage throughout the grid is required to provide the real-time balance necessary to support more distributed renewable assets, and we believe that Athena fulfills this vital need of a modern energy infrastructure. Athena unlocks the value of battery storage by providing energy forecasting, real-time energy 
optimization and automated controls for our customers leveraging over 10 years of operational data and experience. By dispatching electricity to our Commercial & Industrial (“C&I”) customers through our energy storage network during periods of peak power demand, we are able to reduce our customers’ electricity expenses, improve the value of their energy usage and diminish their environmental impact. In addition, our energy storage network enables grid operators to decrease their reliance on conventional generation sources, thereby improving the resiliency of the electrical grid and enabling lower carbon emissions through the increased adoption of renewable generation sources. 
We operate in two key areas within the energy storage landscape: Behind-the-Meter (“BTM”) and Front-of-the-Meter (“FTM”). An energy system’s position in relation to a customer’s electric meter determines whether it is designated a BTM or FTM system. BTM systems installed at C&I customer locations generate energy that can be used on-site without interacting with the electric grid and passing through an electric meter. Our BTM systems are designed to reduce C&I customer energy bills and help our customers achieve their corporate environmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”) objectives. FTM, grid-connected systems deliver power into the grid, which is often sold to off-site customers and must pass through an electric meter prior to reaching an end-user. Our FTM systems are designed to decrease risk for project developers, asset owners, independent power producers and investors by adapting to dynamic energy market conditions in connection with the deployment of electricity and improving the combined value of the solar renewable resource and energy storage over the course of their FTM system’s useful life. As an early participant in the BTM market, we developed operational focus and technical capabilities that position us to have multiple product offerings and services in the evolving market for FTM energy storage services. We believe that Athena’s ability to optimize operations in both the BTM and FTM markets is unique in the industry and provides us with a competitive advantage. 
History 
We were originally known as Star Peak Energy Transition Corp. (“STPK”), which was a special purpose acquisition company that completed its public offering on August 20, 2020. On April 28, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated a business combination (the “Merger”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among STPK, STPK Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of STPK (“Merger Sub”), and Stem, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Stem”). The Merger was effected on the Closing Date through the merger of the Merger Sub with and into Legacy Stem, with Legacy Stem surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Legacy Stem was a private company and is considered the Company’s accounting predecessor. 
On June 30, 2021, we issued 4,683,349 shares of common stock (the “Exchange Shares”) to Star Peak Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“STPK Sponsor”), and Star Peak Sponsor Warrantco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with STPK Sponsor, the “Sellers”). The issuance was pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated as of June 25, 2021 by and among us and the Sellers (the “Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and in consideration of the issuance to the Sellers of the Exchange Shares, the Sellers exchanged 7,181,134 warrants originally issued to STPK Sponsor in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the STPK initial public offering. The Exchange Shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
On August 20, 2021, we issued an irrevocable notice for the redemption of all 12,786,129 of our outstanding public warrants at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on September 20, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”). Pursuant to the notice of redemption, holders of public warrants exercised 12,638,723 public warrants for proceeds to us of $145.3 million, and we redeemed all remaining outstanding public warrants that had not been exercised as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Redemption Date. The public warrants have been delisted from the NYSE, and there are no public warrants left outstanding. 
On November 22, 2021, we sold to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc, as initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers”), and the Initial Purchasers purchased from us, $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Convertible Notes”), pursuant to a purchase agreement dated as of November 17, 2021, by and between us and the Initial Purchasers. The Notes were offered in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act to the Initial Purchasers for initial resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act. On November 17, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the Notes, and on November 19, 2021, in connection with the exercise in full by the Initial Purchasers of their option to purchase additional Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain of the Initial Purchasers of the Notes. The Company’s net proceeds from this offering were approximately $445.7 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. We used approximately $66.7 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions.
On February 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of AlsoEnergy Holdings, Inc. (“AlsoEnergy”) for an aggregate purchase price of $695.0 million, consisting of approximately 75% in cash and approximately 
25% in shares of the Company’s common stock. The acquisition was structured on a cash-free, debt-free basis and subject to other customary adjustments as set forth in the purchase agreement.
The transaction combines our storage optimization capabilities with AlsoEnergy’s solar asset performance monitoring and control software. We will complete our initial accounting for the acquisition during the first quarter of 2022.
Competitive Strengths 
Our competitive strengths include the following: 
•Significant Benefits from Scale & Network Effects: We believe we are the largest in global distributed energy storage megawatts under management, with more than 1.5 GWh operating or contracted across more than 1,000 sites. This generates a significant amount of operational data leading to enhanced software performance through machine-learning and improving customer economics. 
•Advanced Technology Platform: We developed one of the first AI platforms for energy storage and virtual power plants, automating storage participation in electricity markets, performing monitoring and management of customer loads, solar generation and energy prices with real-time, complex decision- making algorithms. The platform is able to co-optimize multiple energy market revenue streams across a diverse fleet of hardware throughout multiple geographies and energy markets. 
•Compelling Business Model & Customer Solutions: We provide a seamless customer experience from commercial proposal to installation. We pioneered a project financed offering for C&I energy storage, providing customers immediate significant savings without capital expenditure. C&I customers are aggressively procuring renewable energy to meet ESG targets and save money on electricity, our solution enables these objectives with no impact to customer operations. Customers sign long-term contracts, typically between 10 and 20 years in duration, while providing us the flexibility to control their energy storage system to earn market participation revenue, lower their energy costs and meet their decarbonization goals. 
•Leading Strategic Partnerships: We have numerous partnerships with a diverse set of industry leaders to reduce execution risk and increase speed to market in certain geographies. In Massachusetts, we have a partnership with Constellation Energy to pair our energy storage systems with retail energy offerings for C&I customers. Internationally, we have partnerships with leading regional industrial equipment and energy firms such as Copec in South America, each focused on leveraging the partner’s local market knowledge and reputation with leading corporates, utilities and grid operators. 
•Exceptional AI and Energy Storage Expertise: We have a seasoned leadership team with a demonstrated track record of execution and more than 150 years of accumulated experience in energy storage, software and distributed energy expertise focused on artificial intelligence and technology development, new market commercialization, renewable project development and utility / grid program operations.

Our Strategy 
Our mission is to build and operate the largest, digitally connected, intelligent energy storage network for our customers. In order to fulfill our mission, (i) we provide our customers, which include commercial and industrial (“C&I”) enterprises as well as independent power producers, renewable project developers, utilities and grid operators, with an energy storage system, sourced from leading, global battery original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), that we deliver through our partners, including solar project developers and engineering, procurement and construction firms and (ii) through our Athena artificial intelligence (“AI”) platform (“Athena”), we provide our customers with on-going software-enabled services to operate the energy storage systems for 10 to 20 years. In addition, in all the markets where we operate our customers’ systems, we have agreements to manage the energy storage systems using the Athena platform to participate in energy markets and to share the revenue from such market participation.
We operate in two key areas within the energy storage landscape: Behind-the-Meter (“BTM”) and Front-of-the-Meter (“FTM”). An energy system’s position in relation to a customer’s electric meter determines whether it is designated a BTM or FTM system. BTM systems provide power that can be used on-site without interacting with the electric grid and passing through an electric meter. Our BTM systems reduce C&I customer energy bills and help our customers facilitate the achievement of their corporate environmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”) objectives. FTM, grid-connected systems provide power to off-site locations and must pass through an electric meter prior to reaching an end-user. Our FTM systems decrease risk for project developers, lead asset professionals, independent power producers and investors by adapting 
to dynamic energy market conditions in connection with the deployment of electricity and improving the value of energy storage over the course of their FTM system’s lifetime.
Our Customers 
We operate in two key markets within the energy storage landscape: BTM and FTM. BTM systems installed at C&I customer locations provide power that can be used on-site without interacting with the electric grid and generally without generating energy that passes through a utility electric meter. FTM grid-connected systems deliver power into the grid which is often sold to off-site customers and transported by the grid prior to reaching an end-user. For BTM customers, we seek to maximize value by providing AI-powered storage services that reduce spending on utility bills, enhance the economics of solar and provide backup power. Additionally, we help BTM customers achieve renewable energy targets as part of their ESG commitments. For FTM customers, we provide software-enabled services to capture revenue from energy market participation, including the sale of capacity, energy and ancillary services into regional electricity markets helping these customers enhance renewable project returns while improving grid resiliency and reliability for utilities and grid operators. These services that we provide are all at the direction of our customers, and we do not independently participate in the wholesale electricity market. 
We believe that Athena’s ability to optimize the operations in both the BTM and FTM markets is unique in the industry and provides a competitive differentiation. As an early participant in the BTM market, we developed operational focus and technical capabilities that position us to have multiple product offerings and services in the evolving market for FTM energy storage services. In particular, we believe recent regulatory actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) and by global utilities and grid operators will enable distributed energy storage systems to participate in energy markets and receive equivalent compensation and market access to the same extent as conventional generation assets. Such regulatory actions are expected to provide new economic opportunities for software-enabled services offerings in the energy storage and broader distributed energy resource markets.
Research and Development 
We have invested significant amounts of time and expense in the development of our Athena platform. The ability to maintain our leadership position depends in part on our ongoing research and development activities. Our software development team of 50 employees is responsible for the design, development, integration and testing of the Athena platform. In addition, we augment our internal team with 15 off-shore contractors for flexible development capacity. We focus our efforts on developing Athena to continuously improve our algorithms, augment value with new revenue streams and localize based on geography and regulatory considerations. 
Our research and development is principally conducted by our teams in the Silicon Valley and Seattle. As of December 31, 2021, we had 66 full-time employees engaged in research and development activities. 
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property is a key differentiator for our business, and we seek protection whenever possible for the intellectual property that we own and control, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information, trade secrets and software tools and applications. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
We have developed a significant patent portfolio to protect elements of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2021, we had 27 issued patents and 4 patent applications pending in the U.S. 
Our intellectual property encompasses a diverse mix of patents with respect to our proprietary systems and software. These patents relate to the following broad categories: 
•power electronics, including the basic interaction of batteries with the power grid where such electronics convert direct current (DC) battery power to alternating current (AC) compatible grid power; 
•analytics and control, including use cases and decisions into the operation of an energy storage system and the coordination of providing economic or operational value to a customer; and 
•networked operations and grid services that involve the aggregation and operation of a group of energy storage systems to provide value to a utility or grid operator. 
Our registered trademarks for goods and services include “Stem,” “Powerscope,” “Athena” and “Energy Superintelligence.” The goods and services relating to these trademarks include, but are not limited to, energy optimization services, software as a service for energy optimization services and energy storage charge and discharge. 
We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the U.S. In an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2021, we had four registered trademarks in the U.S. 
We have no pending claims of infringement or similar claims with third parties with respect to our intellectual property.
Competition 
The energy storage industry is highly competitive, and new regulatory requirements for carbon emissions, technological advances, the lower cost of renewable energy, the decrease in battery costs, improving battery technology and shifting customer demands are causing the industry to evolve and expand. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the energy storage market include, but are not limited to: 
•safety, reliability and quality; 
•product performance and uptime; 
•historical track record and references for customer satisfaction; 
•experience in utilizing the energy storage system for multiple stakeholders; 
•technological innovation; 
•comprehensive solution from a single provider; 
•ease of integration; and 
•seamless hardware and software-enabled service offerings. 
There is rising demand for clean electric power solutions that can provide electric power with lower carbon emissions with high availability. Additionally, the transition to renewable energy sources and distributed energy infrastructure has increased the complexity and variability of end-customer electricity demand. This industry transformation has created an opportunity for an increased role for energy storage solutions like ours. We believe as one of the largest in this industry we have a significant head start against our competition in this rapidly evolving environment. We believe the global push for lower carbon emissions combined with vast technological improvements in lithium-ion battery-powered technologies will drive commercial and industrial customers, utilities, independent power producers and project developers to grow their use of and investment in energy storage systems. 
Our key competitors include energy storage system OEMs, hardware integration providers, renewable project developers and engineering, procurement and construction firms. Our industry peers are typically focused on the development and marketing of single-purpose built solutions with captive hardware offerings, while our AI-powered platform is capable of delivering a multitude of software-enabled services operating an extensive and diverse network of energy storage systems across multiple geographies, utility and grid operator service areas. 
We believe that one of the key advantages driving sustainable differentiation for our company includes the focus and capabilities built in our pioneering history in the BTM segment of the energy storage industry. This experience required an emphasis on AI-driven co-optimization of energy storage operations and the build out of significant operational infrastructure to execute economic considerations for enterprise customers, utilities and grid operators. We believe that the distributed asset management capability from this experience positions us well to compete in the evolving FTM segment of the energy storage industry as recent regulatory actions include the liberalization and formalization of rules for compensation of market participation for distributed energy resources. We believe the legacy single-purpose market for FTM solutions will be driven by greater demand for flexible solutions that can access multiple market opportunities. Our solutions have been designed to mitigate the challenges of today’s enterprise customers, independent power producers, utilities, renewable asset owners and the modern electrical grid at scale with continuous improvements to artificial intelligence optimization strategies informed by operational data from one of the industry’s largest network of digitally-connected energy storage systems. 
We believe we are well-positioned to compete successfully in the market for energy storage hardware and software-enabled services. Despite our limited operating history, we are among the leaders in global distributed energy storage under management, supported by our Athena platform, compelling customer services, strategic partnerships and seasoned leadership team with a proven track record of success. 
Government Regulation and Compliance 
There are varying policy frameworks across the U.S. and abroad designed to support and accelerate customer adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed generation technologies. These policy initiatives come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives and/or electric tariffs. 
Our AI-powered platform manages energy storage systems currently installed in California, Massachusetts, New York, Hawaii and Texas, each of which has its own enabling policy framework. Some states have utility procurement programs and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. These energy storage systems currently qualify for tax exemptions, incentives or other customer incentives in many states, including the states of California, Massachusetts and New York. These policy provisions are subject to change. 
Although we are not regulated as a utility, federal, state and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the U.S., governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative effect on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity. 
Several states have an energy storage mandate or policies designed to encourage the adoption of storage. For example, California offers a cash rebate for storage installations through the Self Generation Incentive Program and Massachusetts and New York offer performance-based financial incentives for storage. Storage installations also are supported in certain states by state public utility commission policies that require utilities to consider alternatives such as storage before they can build new generation. In February 2018, the FERC issued Order 841 directing regional transmission operators and independent system operators to remove barriers to the participation of storage in wholesale electricity markets and to establish rules to help ensure storage resources are compensated for the services they provide. An appeal of Order 841 filed by utility trade associations and other parties challenging the extent of the FERC’s jurisdiction over storage resources connected to distribution systems (among other issues) is currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In September 2020, the FERC issued Order 2222, opening up U.S. wholesale energy markets to aggregations of distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, BTM batteries and electric vehicles. 
Energy storage systems require interconnection agreements from the applicable local electricity utilities in order to operate. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required once interconnection agreements are signed. 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. 
There are government regulations pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our suppliers, as applicable, are required to comply with these regulations in order to sell our batteries into the market. The license and sale of our batteries and technology abroad is likely to be subject to export controls in the future. 
Each of our installations or customer installations must be designed, constructed and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies and laws. To install and operate energy storage systems on our platform, we, our customers or our partners, as applicable, are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from local authorities having jurisdiction to install energy storage systems and to interconnect the systems with the local electrical utility. 
Human Capital Resources
Our mission is to build and operate the largest digitally connected energy storage network for our customers, and we are also committed to creating a world-class workforce. We aim to foster and maintain a workplace that values the unique talents and contributions of every individual. We believe it is the diversity of our people, with varied skills and backgrounds, that shape our success and innovation. Our people-focused culture is driven by collaboration and global cross-functional connections. We recognize the success of Stem is dependent on our talent and the satisfaction of our global workforce, and we are greatly invested in the ability of our people to succeed and thrive. The following discussions provide a description of our employees, and outline how we manage our human capital resources and how we invest in our employees’ success.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 213 employees, of whom 195 were based in the United States and 18 in Canada. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 28% of the global team was female and 72% was male.
We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and consider relations with our employees to be good. Specifically, in response to local government and health guidelines around the COVID-19 pandemic we shifted almost all of our employees to remote work and began offering tools and services for optimizing remote work. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified employees in any operating environment.
Recruiting
We believe in investing for the future, including the future of our workforce, and have several talent programs to recruit exceptional individuals who share our values. Our recruiting team and hiring managers begin with the creation of detailed job descriptions, which clearly outline the skills and experience necessary for success in each role. We believe these steps are essential to effectively interview for identifiable skillsets and not just “personality fits.” We strive to build our workforce from within whenever possible; however, if the best candidate for an available position is not identified from within our existing talent pool, we will look externally for the best talent. Our recruitment strategy is to initially search for candidates directly through our professional networks, university and mentorship programs, and through advertising with certain partners. We also occasionally use recruitment consultants and search firms.
Professional Development
We are committed to helping people realize their highest potential and fostering a culture that supports personal development for individuals, leaders and teams across the organization. Our employees enjoy ample opportunity to learn new skills to develop and advance their career, and we provide opportunities for all our employees to receive ongoing formal training to help foster their professional development. We also encourage continuing education programs through approved institutions and online learning such as Udemy and Stem University.
Employee Feedback
We value the feedback we receive from our employees. Our annual employee engagement survey asks all of our employees for their input on a variety of matters. The results of the employee survey are disseminated to all employees, and the results are used to design action plans to assist managers with actively responding to employees’ sentiments. The employee survey is an important tool that allows us to continuously improve, innovate and evolve through ongoing engagement and measurement.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to building an inclusive culture and team environment that supports current and future diversity in our industry and our talent. In the spirit of Stem’s core values we are One Team and succeed through collaboration when we respect, acknowledge and celebrate each other’s differences. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment that promotes equality, cultural awareness and respect by implementing policies, benefits, training, recruiting and recognition practices to support our colleagues. We believe that diversity and inclusion is about valuing our differences and continually identifying ways to improve our cultural intelligence which ultimately leads to better decision-making and a more tailored client experience. To help us achieve and maintain a diverse workforce, we globally monitor certain employee demographic data such as gender, ethnicity, tenure and age.
Employee Compensation, Benefits & Wellbeing
We strive to enrich and elevate the lives of our employees through a robust compensation and benefits package that is flexible to meet both individual and family needs, including but not limited to:
•Market competitive compensation packages;
•Robust health and well-being benefits, including a variety of medical, dental, and vision benefit offerings, and physical and mental health programs;
•Paid maternity/paternity leave;
•Snacks and beverages in the office;
•Competitive paid time off and paid holidays;
•Retirement plan alternatives and education offerings; and
