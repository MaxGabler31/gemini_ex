Index

Research Publishing & Platforms revenue by product type includes Research Publishing and Research Platforms. The graphs below present revenue by product type for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021:

Key growth strategies for the Research Publishing & Platforms segment include evolving and developing new licensing models for our institutional customers (“pay to read and publish”), developing new open access journals and revenue streams (“pay to publish”), focusing resources on high-growth and emerging markets, and developing new digital products, services, and workflow solutions to meet the needs of researchers, authors, societies, and corporate customers.

Research Publishing

Research Publishing generates the majority of its revenue from contracts with its customers in the following revenue streams:
  
• | Journal Subscriptions (“pay to read”), Open Access (“pay to publish”), and Transformational Models (“pay to read and publish”); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other.
--+-------------------------------------------

Journal Subscriptions, Open Access, and Transformational Models

As of April 30, 2022, we publish over 1,900 academic research journals. We sell journal subscriptions directly to thousands of Research institutions worldwide through our sales representatives, indirectly through independent subscription agents, through promotional campaigns, and through memberships in professional societies for those journals that are sponsored by societies. Journal subscriptions are primarily licensed through contracts for digital content available online through our Wiley Online Library platform. Contracts are negotiated by us directly with customers or their subscription agents. Subscription periods typically cover calendar years. Print journals are generally mailed to subscribers directly from independent printers. We do not own or manage printing facilities. Subscription revenue is generally collected in advance.

Approximately 53% of Journal Subscription revenue is derived from publishing rights owned by Wiley. Publishing alliances also play a major role in Research Publishing’s success. Approximately 47% of Journal Subscription revenue is derived from publication rights that are owned by professional societies and published by us pursuant to long-term contracts or owned jointly with professional societies. These society alliances bring mutual benefit: The societies gain Wiley’s publishing, marketing, sales, and distribution expertise, while Wiley benefits from being affiliated with prestigious societies and their members. Societies that sponsor or own such journals generally receive a royalty and/or other financial consideration. We may procure editorial services from such societies on a prenegotiated fee basis. We also enter into agreements with outside independent editors of journals that define their editorial duties and the fees and expenses for their services. Contributors of articles to our journal portfolio transfer publication rights to us or a professional society, as applicable. We publish the journals of many prestigious societies, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the European Molecular Biology Organization, the American Anthropological Association, the American Geophysical Union, and the German Chemical Society.

Wiley Online Library, which is delivered through our Literatum platform, provides the user with intuitive navigation, enhanced discoverability, expanded functionality, and a range of personalization options. Access to abstracts is free and full content is accessible through licensing agreements or as individual article purchases. Large portions of the content are provided free or at nominal cost to nations in the developing world through partnerships with certain nonprofit organizations. Our online publishing platforms provide revenue growth opportunities through new applications and business models, online advertising, deeper market penetration, and individual sales and pay-per-view options.

Wiley’s performance in the 2020 release of Clarivate Analytics’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) remains strong, maintaining its top 3 position in terms of the number of titles indexed, articles published, and citations received. Wiley has 10% of titles, 11% of articles, and 11% of citations.
  
Index

A total of 1,281 Wiley journals were included in the reports. Wiley journals ranked #1 in 20 categories across 17 titles and achieved 219 top-10 category rankings.

The annual JCR are one of the most widely used sources of citation metrics used to analyze the performance of peer-reviewed journals. The most famous of these metrics, the Impact Factor, is based on the frequency with which an average article is cited in the JCR report year. Alongside other metrics, this makes it an important tool for evaluating a journal’s impact on ongoing research.

Under the Open Access business model, accepted research articles are published subject to payment of Article Publication Charges (APCs) and then all open articles are immediately free to access online. Contributors of open access articles retain many rights and typically license their work under terms that permit reuse.

Open Access offers authors choices in how to share and disseminate their work, and it serves the needs of researchers who may be required by their research funder to make articles freely accessible without embargo. APCs are typically paid by the individual author or by the author’s funder, and payments are often mediated by the author’s institution. We provide specific workflows and infrastructure to authors, funders, and institutions to support the requirements of Open Access.

We offer two Open Access publishing models. The first of these is Hybrid Open Access where authors publishing in the majority of our paid subscription journals, after article acceptance, are offered the opportunity to make their individual research article openly available online.

The second offering of the Open Access model is a growing portfolio of fully open access journals, also known as Gold Open Access Journals. All Open Access articles are subject to the same rigorous peer-review process applied to our subscription-based journals. As with our subscription portfolio, a number of the Gold Open Access Journals are published under contract for, or in partnership with, prestigious societies, including the American Geophysical Union, the American Heart Association, the European Molecular Biology Organization, and the British Ecological Society. The Open Access portfolio spans life, physical, medical, and social sciences and includes a choice of high impact journals and broad-scope titles that offer a responsive, author-centered service.

Transformational agreements (“read and publish”), are an innovative model that blends Journal Subscription and Open Access offerings. Essentially, for a single fee, a national or regional consortium of libraries pays for and receives full read access to our journal portfolio and the ability to publish under an open access arrangement. Like subscriptions, transformational agreements involve recurring revenue under multiyear contracts. Transformational models accelerate the transition to open access while maintaining subscription access.

Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other
 Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other includes advertising, backfile sales, the licensing of publishing rights, journal and article reprints, and individual article sales. We generate advertising revenue from print and online journal subscription products, our online publishing platform, Literatum, online events such as webinars and virtual conferences, community interest websites such as spectroscopyNOW.com, and other websites. A backfile license provides access to a historical collection of Wiley journals, generally for a one-time fee. We also engage with international publishers and receive licensing revenue from reproductions, translations, and other digital uses of our content. Journal and article reprints are primarily used by pharmaceutical companies and other industries for marketing and promotional purposes. Through the Article Select and PayPerView programs, we provide fee-based access to nonsubscribed journal articles, content, book chapters, and major reference work articles. The Research Publishing business is also a provider of content and services in evidence-based medicine (EBM). Through our alliance with The Cochrane Collaboration, we publish The Cochrane Library, a premier source of high-quality independent evidence to inform healthcare decision-making. EBM facilitates the effective management of patients through clinical expertise informed by best practice evidence that is derived from medical literature.
Research Platforms

Research Platforms is principally comprised of Atypon, a publishing software and service provider that enables scholarly and professional societies and publishers to deliver, host, enhance, market, and manage their content on the web through the Literatum platform. 

Literatum, our online publishing platform for societies and other research publishers, delivers integrated access to more than 10 million articles from approximately 2,800 journals, as well as 26,000 online books and hundreds of multivolume reference works, laboratory protocols and databases.  The Literatum platform hosts more than 46% of the world’s English language journals.
  
Index

On November 30, 2021, we acquired the assets of the eJournalPress (EJP) business from Precision Computer Works, Inc. EJP is a technology platform company with an established journal submission and peer-review management system. On October 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of J&J Editorial Services, LLC. (J&J). J&J is a publishing services company providing expert offerings in editorial operations, production, copyediting, system support and consulting. The results of these acquisitions have been included in Research Platforms.
Fiscal Year 2023 Changes to Revenue by Product Type  
 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, our revenue by product type previously referred to as Research Platforms will be changed to Research Solutions.  Research Solutions will include infrastructure and publishing services that help societies and corporations thrive in a complex knowledge ecosystem. In addition to Platforms (Atypon), certain product offerings such as corporate sales which included the recent acquisitions of Madgex Holdings Limited (Madgex), and Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.’s Informatics products (Informatics) that were previously included in Research Publishing will be moved to Research Solutions.  Research Solutions will also include product offerings related to certain recent acquisitions such as J&J, and EJP.
Academic & Professional Learning:

Our Academic & Professional Learning segment provides Education Publishing and Professional Learning products and services, including scientific, professional, and education print and digital books, digital courseware, and test preparation services, to libraries, corporations, students, professionals, and researchers, as well as learning, development, and assessment services for businesses and professionals. Communities served include business, finance, accounting, workplace learning, management, leadership, technology, behavioral health, engineering/architecture, science and medicine, and education. Products are developed for worldwide distribution through multiple channels, including chain and online booksellers, libraries, colleges and universities, corporations, direct to consumer, websites, distributor networks, and other online applications. Publishing centers include Australia, Germany, India, the UK, and the US. Academic & Professional Learning accounted for approximately 31% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended April 30, 2022, with a 28.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin. Approximately 55% of revenue is from digital and online products and services.

Academic & Professional Learning revenue by product type includes Education Publishing and Professional Learning. The graphs below present revenue by product type for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021:

Key strategies for the Academic & Professional Learning business include developing and acquiring products and services to drive career-connected education, developing leading brands and franchises, executing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and innovating digital content and courseware formats while expanding their global discoverability and distribution. We continue to implement strategies to manage declines in print revenue through cost improvement initiatives and focusing our efforts on growing our digital lines of business. 

Book sales for Education Publishing and Professional Learning are generally made on a returnable basis with certain restrictions. We provide for estimated future returns on sales made during the year based on historical return experience and current market trends.

Materials for book publications are obtained from authors throughout most of the world, utilizing the efforts of an editorial staff, outside editorial advisors, and advisory boards. Most materials are originated by the authors themselves or as the result of suggestion or solicitations by editors and advisors. We enter into agreements with authors that state the terms and conditions under which the materials will be published, the name in which the copyright will be registered, the basis for any royalties, and other matters. Most of the authors are compensated with royalties, which vary depending on the nature of the product. We may make advance royalty payments against future royalties to authors of certain publications. Royalty advances are reviewed for recoverability and a reserve for loss is maintained, if appropriate.

 
Index

We continue to add new titles, revise existing titles, and discontinue the sale of others in the normal course of our business, and we also create adaptations of original content for specific markets based on customer demand. Our general practice is to revise our textbooks approximately every three years, if warranted, and to revise other titles as appropriate. Subscription-based products are updated on a more frequent basis.

We generally contract with independent printers and binderies globally for their services. Management believes that adequate printing and binding facilities and sources of paper and other required materials are available to it, and that it is not dependent upon any single supplier.

In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to outsource our US-based book distribution operations to Cengage Learning, with the continued aim of improving efficiency in our distribution activities and moving to a more variable cost model. As of April 30, 2022, we had one global warehousing and distribution facility remaining, which is in the UK.

Education Publishing
 Education Publishing generates the majority of its revenue from contracts with its customers in the following revenue streams:
  
• | Education Publishing
--+---------------------


• | Digital Courseware
--+-------------------


• | Test Preparation and Certification
--+-----------------------------------


• | Licensing and Other
--+--------------------

Education Publishing

Education textbooks and related supplementary material and digital products are sold primarily to bookstores and online booksellers serving both for-profit and nonprofit educational institutions (primarily colleges and universities), and direct-to-students. We employ sales representatives who call on faculty responsible for selecting books to be used in courses and on the bookstores that serve such institutions and their students. The textbook business is seasonal, with the majority of textbook sales occurring during the July-through-October and December-through-January periods. There are active used and rental print textbook markets, which adversely affect the sale of new textbooks. We are exploring opportunities to expand into the rental print textbook market.

STM books (Reference) are sold and distributed globally in digital and print formats through multiple channels, including research libraries and library consortia, independent subscription agents, direct sales to professional society members, bookstores, online booksellers, and other customers.

We develop content in a digital format that can be used for both digital and print products, resulting in productivity and efficiency savings and enabling print-on-demand delivery. Book content is available online through Wiley Online Library (delivered through our Literatum platform), WileyPLUS, zyBooks®, alta™, and other proprietary platforms. Digital books are delivered to intermediaries, including Amazon, Apple, Google, and Ingram/Vital-Source®, for re-sale to individuals in various industry-standard formats, which are now the preferred deliverable for licensees of all types, including foreign language publishers. Digital books are also licensed to libraries through aggregators. Specialized formats for digital textbooks go to distributors servicing the academic market, and digital book collections are sold by subscription through independent third-party aggregators servicing distinct communities. Custom deliverables are provided to corporations, institutions, and associations to educate their employees, generate leads for their products, and extend their brands. Content from digital books is also used to create online articles, mobile apps, newsletters, and promotional collateral. This continual reuse of content improves margins, speeds delivery, and helps satisfy a wide range of customer needs. Our online presence not only enables us to deliver content online, but also to sell more books. The growth of online booksellers benefits us because they provide unlimited virtual “shelf space” for our entire backlist. Publishing alliances and franchise products are important to our strategy. Education and STM publishing (including Test Preparation) alliance partners include the AICPA, the CFA Institute, ACT (American College Test), IEEE, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and many others. The ability to join Wiley’s product development, sales, marketing, distribution, and technology with a partner’s content, technology, and/or brand name has contributed to our success.

Digital Courseware

We offer high-quality online learning solutions, including WileyPLUS, a research-based, online environment for effective teaching and learning that is integrated with a complete digital textbook. WileyPLUS improves student learning through instant feedback, personalized learning plans, and self-evaluation tools, as well as a full range of course-oriented activities, including online planning, presentations, study, homework, and testing. In selected courses, WileyPLUS includes a personalized adaptive learning component, Orion, which is based on cognitive science. Orion helps to build student proficiency on topics while improving the effectiveness of their study time. It assists educators in identifying areas that need reinforcement and measures student engagement and proficiency throughout the course.

The highly interactive zyBooks platform enables learners to learn by doing while allowing professors to be more efficient and devote more time to teaching. The platform maximizes learner engagement and retention through demonstration and hands-on learning experiences using interactive question sets, animations, tools, and embedded labs. The zyBooks platform will become an essential component of Wiley’s differentiated digital learning experience and, when combined with the alta adaptive learning technology, will power lower-cost, higher-impact education across Wiley’s education business.

In addition, Education Services OPM derives revenue from unbundled service offerings.
Talent Development Services

On January 1, 2020, Wiley acquired mthree, a rapidly growing talent placement provider that addresses the IT skills gap by finding, training, and placing job-ready technology talent in roles with leading corporations worldwide. In late May 2022, Wiley renamed the mthree talent development solution to Wiley Edge. Talent Development Services sources, trains, and prepares aspiring students and professionals to meet the skill needs of today’s technology careers, and then places them with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, technology companies, and government agencies.

Health, Safety & Well-Being

Safeguarding and promoting colleague well-being is central to what we do, as it is critically important we provide the tools and resources they need to be healthy and at their best. We support our colleagues in maintaining their physical, emotional, social, and financial well-being through working practices, education and benefit programs.

This became even more critical at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we acted quickly and with purpose to protect and support our colleagues. Below are actions Wiley has taken throughout the ongoing pandemic:

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)

With the hiring of our Vice President, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Director, DEI Strategy, we are operationalizing critical priorities within three DEI activators—Inclusive Community, Enhancing our Foundation, and Understanding our People. These activators reflect our DEI near-term priorities to propel a sustainable, inclusive organization that embodies diversity, and equity throughout our policies, programs and processes, and fosters an inclusive culture where people feel like they can be themselves.

Our Employee Resource Groups help drive our DEI priorities through learning opportunities and Wiley community events. As a member of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, Wiley demonstrates its commitment to sustained, concrete actions that advance diversity and inclusive thinking, behavior, and business practices in the workplace. We also proudly received a 100% score from the Human Rights Foundation for LGBTQ workplace equality.

Culture, Engagement & Learning

Investment in colleague development and growth for current and future roles is central to our culture. Wiley provides development programs, skill development courses and self-paced multi-language resources to help provide ongoing learning offerings for our people. Leveraging Wiley’s CrossKnowledge platform, we offer interactive development programs which allow colleagues to share lessons learned, best practices and have interactive opportunities with their peers. We also focus on higher-ed programs and certifications with our Wiley Beyond platform, which offers access to university programs as well as technical and industry-recognized certification programs.

We conduct our Talent Review annually, focusing on high performing and high potential talent, diversity, and succession for our most critical roles. We are committed to identifying, growing, and retaining top talent and ensuring we have the right skills for the future. We establish key development action planning opportunities for each colleague to build bench strength and review development progress and mobility regularly.

Our culture differentiates us as an organization and our core values define how we work together. We ask colleagues to embody our three values—Learning Champion, Needle Mover, and Courageous Teammate. These values define who we are as a company and what we stand for.

Our Environmental Responsibility

We strive to make good choices for the environment, our customers and our business. To further our commitment, this year we hired a VP of Environmental, Social, Governance and Corporate Impact to drive forward our sustainability efforts. We believe environmental responsibility and business objectives are fundamentally connected and essential to our operations. This is why we are acting now to limit our impact on the environment—measuring our carbon emissions and advancing sustainability initiatives. Our commitment is also evidenced by our signing onto the Publishing Declares Climate Action pledge.

In each of our fiscal years beginning in fiscal year 2020, we have conducted a comprehensive independent third-party GHG assessment for our Global Operations. For fiscal year 2022, we are a CarbonNeutral® certified company across our Global Operations, in accordance with the CarbonNeutral Protocol. Our locations use 100% renewable energy through green tariffs and energy attribute certificates (EACs). Most of our global office real estate is leased and, whenever possible, we work with property owners to optimize sustainability.

We also work with publishing partners, where possible, to reduce print production and consumption, reduce excess inventory through print-on-demand and encourage digital consumption of our products.

We updated our Paper Selection and Use Policy which supports high environmental standards. In July 2021, we completed our inaugural Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Forests disclosure and plan to expand our disclosures in the coming years.

In a program entitled Go Green, we partnered with Trees for the Future to plant a tree for every copy of a journal we actively stop printing, up to one million trees. To date, over 230,000 trees have been planted as a result.

We are always seeking opportunities to improve environmental performance. We comply with environmental laws and regulations, thoughtfully investing resources toward managing environmental affairs and raising awareness of global environmental issues through education and research.
