ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
General
JetBlue Airways Corporation, or JetBlue, is New York's Hometown Airline®. As of December 31, 2021, JetBlue served over 100 destinations across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, and between New York and London.
JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 and commenced service on February 11, 2000. We believe our differentiated product and culture combined with our competitive cost structure enables us to compete effectively in the high-value geographies we serve. Looking to the future, we plan to continue to grow in our high-value geographies, invest in industry leading products and provide award-winning service by our 22,000+ dedicated employees, whom we refer to as crewmembers. Going forward, we believe we will continue to differentiate ourselves from other airlines, enabling us to continue to attract a greater mix of customers, and to drive continued growth. We are focused on delivering solid results for our stockholders, our customers, and our crewmembers. 
 As used in this Report, the terms “JetBlue,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to JetBlue Airways Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal executive offices are located at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, Long Island City, New York 11101 and our telephone number is (718) 286-7900. 
Our Industry and Competition
The U.S. airline industry is extremely competitive and challenging, and results are often volatile. It is uniquely susceptible to external factors such as fuel costs, downturns in domestic and international economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, and associated stay at home orders, vaccination mandates, masking requirements and travel restrictions, the impact of airline restructurings or consolidations, and military actions or acts of terrorism. We operate in a capital and energy intensive industry that has high fixed costs, as well as heavy taxation and fees. Airline returns are sensitive to slight changes in fuel prices, average fare levels, and customer demand. The industry's principal competitive factors include fares, brand and customer service, route networks, flight schedules, aircraft types, safety records, codeshare and interline relationships, inflight entertainment and connectivity systems, and frequent flyer programs. 
The COVID-19 Pandemic
The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a material adverse impact on our operating revenues and financial position. We began seeing signs of demand recovery in February 2021 which continued to progress throughout the year. Although the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants temporarily decelerated the demand for travel in 2021, we believe customer confidence will continue to grow, resulting in sustained demand improvement going forward. We expect the recovery of domestic demand to outpace the recovery of international demand in most regions.
JETBLUE EXPERIENCE
 We offer our customers a distinctive flying experience which we refer to as the "JetBlue Experience''. We believe we deliver award-winning service that focuses on the entire customer experience, from booking an itinerary to arrival at the final destination. Typically, our customers are neither high-traffic business travelers nor ultra-price sensitive travelers. Rather, we believe we are the carrier of choice for the majority of travelers who have been underserved by other airlines as we offer a differentiated product and award winning customer service. 
Differentiated Product and Culture
Delivering the JetBlue Experience to our customers through our differentiated product and culture is core to our mission to inspire humanity. We look to attract new customers to our brand and provide current customers with a reason to come back by continuing to innovate and evolve the JetBlue Experience. We believe we can adapt to the changing needs of our customers and a key element of our success is the belief that competitive fares and quality air travel need not be mutually exclusive. 
Our award winning service begins from the moment our customers purchase a ticket through one of our distribution channels such as www.jetblue.com, our mobile applications, or our reservations centers. Customers can purchase one of five branded fares: Blue Basic, Blue, Blue Plus, Blue Extra, and Mint®, our premium service. Each fare includes different offerings such as priority boarding, advance seat selections, free checked bags, reduced change fees, and additional TrueBlue® points, with all fares including our core offering of free inflight entertainment, free brand name snacks, and free non-alcoholic beverages. Customers can choose to “buy up” to an option with additional offerings. These different fares allow customers to 
select the products or services they need or value when they travel, without having to pay for the things they do not need or value. 
Upon arrival at the airport, our customers are welcomed by our dedicated crewmembers and can choose to purchase one or more of our ancillary options such as Even More® Speed, allowing them to enjoy an expedited security experience in most domestic JetBlue locations. Customers who select our Blue Extra or Mint® fares receive Even More® Speed as part of their fare. We additionally have mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices which have robust features including real-time flight information updates and mobile check-in for certain routes. Our applications are designed to enhance our customers' travel experience and are in keeping with the JetBlue Experience. 
Our self-service layout in select BlueCities redesigned the way our customers travel through the airport lobby. Our user-friendly kiosks are the first point of contact for each customer traveling through the airport lobby and allow for contact-less service. While all customers are encouraged to use the kiosks, our lobby layout allows them to choose the check-in experience they prefer. Customers who choose to use our kiosk receive a virtually queue-less experience. The self-service model allows crewmembers to get out from behind the ticket counter and move through the lobby to guide our customers through the check-in process. For customers who prefer a more traditional experience, our Help Desk offers full-service check-in. The self-service lobby opens up the opportunity for our crewmembers to make personal connections with our customers, to assist with bag tagging, to answer customer questions, and to direct them to their next step in the travel experience.
Once onboard our aircraft, customers enjoy seats in a comfortable layout with the most legroom in the main cabin of all U.S. airlines, based on average fleet-wide seat pitch. Our Even More® Space seats are available for purchase across our fleet, giving customers the opportunity to enjoy additional legroom. Customers on certain routes have the option to purchase Mint®, our premium service.
In February 2021, we unveiled a reimagined version of our Mint® experience. The new service includes a completely refreshed cabin design featuring private suites with a sliding door for every Mint® customer. Each Mint® aircraft also include two Mint® Studio suites which offers the most space in a premium experience from any U.S. airline based on personal square footage per passenger seat. We debuted this new premium service with a 16-seat individual suite layout on select flights between New York and Los Angeles in June 2021. In August 2021, we began transatlantic flights to London that include the new Mint® experience with 24 individual suites. 
 Our inflight entertainment system onboard our Airbus A321 aircraft, Airbus A220 aircraft, and certain restyled Airbus A320 aircraft includes 100+ channels of DIRECTV®, 100+ channels of SiriusXM Radio® and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Customers on our Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 aircraft have access to 36 channels of free DIRECTV®, 100+ channels of free SiriusXM Radio® and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Our entire fleet is equipped with Fly-Fi®, a broadband product that allows gate-to-gate Wi-Fi at every seat. Customers also have access to the Fly-Fi® Hub, a content portal where customers can access a wide range of movies, television shows, and additional content from their own personal devices. 
All customers may enjoy an assortment of free and unlimited brand name snacks and non-alcoholic beverages and have the option to purchase additional products such as blankets, pillows, headphones, premium beverages and premium food selections. Our Mint® customers have access to an assortment of complimentary food, beverages and products including a small-plates menu, artisanal snacks, alcoholic beverages, a blanket, pillows, and headphones. 
 Because of our network strength in leisure destinations, we also sell vacation packages through our wholly owned subsidiary, JBTP, LLC, or JetBlue Travel Products, a one-stop, value-priced vacation service for self-directed packaged travel planning. These packages offer competitive fares for air travel on JetBlue along with a selection of JetBlue-recommended hotels and resorts, car rentals, and local attractions. 
We work to provide a superior air travel experience, including communicating openly and honestly with customers about delays and service disruptions. We have a Customer Bill of Rights which was introduced in 2007 to provide compensation to customers who experience inconveniences. This Customer Bill of Rights commits us to high service standards and holds us accountable if we fall short. 
Our customers have repeatedly indicated the distinctive JetBlue Experience is an important reason why they select us over other carriers. We measure and monitor customer feedback regularly which helps us to continuously improve customer satisfaction. One way we do so is by measuring our net promoter score, or NPS. This metric is used by companies in a broad range of industries to measure and monitor the customer experience. Many of the leading consumer brands that are recognized for great customer service receive high NPS scores. We believe a higher NPS score has positive effects on customer loyalty and ultimately leads to increased revenue.
Network
We are a predominately point-to-point system carrier, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities: New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Orlando, Los Angeles, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All six of our focus cities are in regions with a diverse mix of traffic. 
Leisure traveler focused airlines are often faced with high seasonality. As a result, we continually work to manage our mix of customers to include both business travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives, or VFR. VFR travelers tend to be slightly less seasonal and less susceptible to economic downturns than traditional leisure destination travelers. Understanding the purpose of our customers' travel helps us optimize destinations, strengthen our network, and increase unit revenues. As we navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to be nimble, react to changes in our customers' behaviors, and deploy capacity in areas of our network that creates the most value.
Largely enabled by the Northeast Alliance (the "NEA") with American Airlines Group Inc. ("American"), we announced nine new BlueCities and 32 new routes in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our network served 107 BlueCities in 31 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 24 countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, and England, our first country in Europe. 
We group our capacity distribution based upon geographical regions rather than on a mileage or a length-of-haul basis. The historic distribution of ASMs, or capacity, by region for the years ending December 31 was:

Capacity Distribution | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Transcontinental | 31.0 | % | | 31.7 | % | 32.0 | %
Caribbean & Latin America (1) | 36.8 | | | 31.4 | | 31.2 | 
Florida | 24.9 | | | 27.4 | | 25.2 | 
East | 3.2 | | | 4.5 | | 6.0 | 
Central | 3.0 | | | 4.0 | | 4.0 | 
West | 0.7 | | | 1.0 | | 1.6 | 
Transatlantic(2) | 0.4 | | | — | | — | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1) Domestic operations as defined by the U.S. Department of Transport, or DOT, include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but for the purposes of the capacity distribution table above, we have included these locations in the Caribbean and Latin America region.
(2) In August 2021, we launched our inaugural transatlantic service from John F. Kennedy International Airport ("JFK") in New York to London Heathrow Airport. We further expanded our presence in the transatlantic market with service from JFK to London Gatwick Airport, which began in September 2021. We expect to begin service to London from Boston Logan International Airport in summer 2022.
In 2022, we expect to resume our plans to increase our presence in our focus cities and diversify our network as we continue to recover from the pandemic. On February 19, 2022, we began service to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. We have also previously announced service to the following new destinations:

Destination | Service Expected to Commence
Kansas City, Missouri | March 27, 2022 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin | March 27, 2022 
Vancouver, Canada | June 9, 2022 
Asheville, North Carolina | June 16, 2022 

Airline Commercial Partnerships
Airlines frequently participate in commercial partnerships with other carriers in order to increase customer convenience by providing interline-connectivity, codeshare, complementary flight schedules, frequent flyer program reciprocity, and other joint marketing activities. As of December 31, 2021, we had 47 airline commercial partnerships. Our commercial partnerships typically begin as an interline agreement allowing a customer to book a single itinerary with tickets on multiple airlines. On their day of travel, they enjoy a simplified airport experience with single check-in and bag drop. 
Northeast Alliance
In July 2020, we announced our intention to enter into a strategic relationship with American Airlines Group Inc. ("American"). Once fully implemented, this arrangement, known as the Northeast Alliance (the "NEA"), includes an alliance agreement with reciprocal code sharing on domestic and international routes to, from or connecting through New York (John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport) and Boston, excluding JetBlue's European transatlantic flying. We believe this partnership creates more capacity, seamless connectivity for travelers in the northeast, and offers more choices for customers across the networks of both airlines. In addition, we believe this relationship will accelerate our recovery as the travel industry adapts to new trends and requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to federal law, American and JetBlue submitted this proposed alliance arrangement to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for review. After American, JetBlue and the DOT agreed to a series of commitments, the DOT terminated its review of the proposed alliance. The commitments include growth commitments to ensure capacity expansion, slot divestitures at JFK and at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. and antitrust compliance measures. Beyond this agreement with the DOT, American and JetBlue will also limit their coordination on certain city pair markets within the scope of the alliance. 
Implementation of the NEA began in February 2021. Since then, JetBlue and American have collectively grown across New York and Boston, offering customers more options for travel and returning crewmembers back to the operations faster. We are investing in a seamless customer experience and have also introduced loyalty benefits that will give both JetBlue and American customers the opportunity to earn and redeem on both airlines.
On September 21, 2021, the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), along with the Attorneys General of six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against JetBlue and American concerning the previously implemented NEA. The lawsuit asserts and seeks an adjudication that the NEA violates U.S. antitrust laws, and that we and American should be permanently enjoined from continuing, and restrained from further implementing, the NEA.
Also on September 21, 2021, the DOT published a Clarification Notice relating to the agreement that had been reached between the DOT, JetBlue, and American in January 2021, at the conclusion of the DOT’s review of the NEA ("DOT Agreement"). The DOT Clarification Notice stated, among other things, that the DOT Agreement remains in force during the pendency of the DOJ action against the NEA and, while the DOT retains independent statutory authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition in air transportation, the DOT intends to defer to DOJ to resolve the antitrust concerns that the DOJ has identified with respect to the NEA. The DOT simultaneously published a Notice Staying Proceeding in relation to a complaint by Spirit Airlines, Inc. regarding the NEA, pending resolution of the DOJ action described above.
We believe the lawsuit is without merit and, along with American, intends to defend itself vigorously. In November 2021, JetBlue and American filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ's lawsuit against the NEA. Motion practice has concluded and the parties await a decision, while the lawsuit proceeds concurrently.
 In 2022, we expect to continue to seek additional strategic opportunities through new commercial partners as well as assess ways to deepen existing airline partnerships, including the NEA. We plan to do this by expanding codeshare relationships and other areas of cooperation such as frequent flyer programs. We believe these commercial partnerships allow us to better leverage our strong network and drive incremental traffic and revenue while improving off-peak travel.
Marketing 
JetBlue is a widely recognized and respected global brand. JetBlue created a new category in air travel and our brand stands for high service quality at a reasonable cost. We believe this brand has evolved into an important and valuable asset which identifies us as a safe, reliable, high value airline. Similarly, we believe customer awareness of our brand has contributed to the success of our marketing efforts. It enables us to promote ourselves as a preferred marketing partner with companies across many different industries. 
We market our services through advertising and promotions in various media forms including popular social media outlets. We engage in large multi-market programs, local events and sponsorships across our route network as well as mobile marketing programs. Our targeted public and community relations efforts reflect our commitment to the communities we serve, promote brand awareness, and complement our strong reputation. 
Distribution
Our primary and preferred distribution channel to customers is through our website, www.jetblue.com, our lowest cost channel. Our website allows us to more closely control and deliver the JetBlue Experience while also offering the full suite of JetBlue Fare Options, Even More® Space and Speed, and other ancillary services. 
Our participation in global distribution systems, or GDS, supports our profitable growth, particularly in the business market. We find business customers are more likely to book through a travel agency or a booking product which relies on a GDS platform. Although the cost of sales through this channel is higher than through our website, the average fare purchased 
through a GDS is generally higher and often covers the increased distribution costs. We currently participate in several major GDS and online travel agents, or OTA. Due to the majority of our customers booking travel on our website, we maintain relatively low distribution costs which helps us offer lower fares to customers.
Customer Loyalty Program
TrueBlue® is our customer loyalty program designed to reward and recognize loyal customers. Members earn points based upon, among other methods, the amount paid for JetBlue flights and services from certain commercial partners. Our points do not expire, the program has no black-out dates, points can be redeemed for any open seat, and any JetBlue destination can be booked if the TrueBlue® member has enough points to exchange for the value of an open seat. Mosaic® is an additional level for our most loyal customers who (1) fly a minimum of 30 times with JetBlue and acquire at least 12,000 base flight points within a calendar year, (2) accumulate 15,000 base flight points within a calendar year, or (3) in certain circumstances, qualify through a minimum credit card spend of $50,000 in a calendar year.
We made several updates to our TrueBlue® program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include extending the status of all current Mosaic® customers through 2021 and also reducing the qualification requirements for customers trying to earn Mosaic® status by 50% in 2021. Under the updated program, customers can now enjoy Mosaic® benefits by either (1) flying a minimum of 15 times with JetBlue and acquiring at least 6,000 base flight points within a calendar year or (2) accumulating 7,500 base flight points within a calendar year. In certain circumstances, customers may also qualify for Mosaic® status through a minimum credit card spend of $30,000 in a calendar year plus at least 4,000 base points during the calendar year. These reduced qualification requirements were effective through the end of 2021.
We currently have co-branded loyalty credit cards available to eligible U.S. residents, as well as co-brand agreements in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to allow cardholders to earn TrueBlue® points. Our co-branded credit cards in the United States are issued in partnership with Barclaycard® on the MasterCard® network. We also have co-branded loyalty credit cards issued by Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and MasterCard® in Puerto Rico as well as Banco Popular Dominicano and MasterCard® in the Dominican Republic. These credit cards allow customers in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to take full advantage of our TrueBlue® loyalty program. 
We have various agreements with other loyalty partners, including financial institutions, hotels, and car rental companies, that allow their customers to earn TrueBlue® points through participation in our partners’ programs. We intend to continue to develop the footprint of our co-branded credit cards and pursue other loyalty partnerships in the future.
OPERATIONS AND COST STRUCTURE 
Historically, our cost structure has allowed us to price fares lower than many of our competitors and was a principal reason for our profitable growth prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Our cost advantage relative to some of our competitors was due to, among other factors, high aircraft utilization, new and efficient aircraft, relatively low distribution costs, and a productive workforce. Because our network initiatives and growth plans require a low cost platform, we strive to stay focused on our competitive costs, operational excellence, efficiency improvements, and enhancing critical elements of the JetBlue Experience. We will remain nimble and continue to execute on our cost plan in the face of changing customer behaviors, and staffing related cost pressures, as we continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Route Structure 
JetBlue's point-to-point system is the foundation of our operational structure, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities. This structure allows us to optimize costs as well as accommodate customers' preference for nonstop itineraries. A vast majority of our operations are centered in the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. This airspace is some of the world's most congested and drives certain operational constraints.
Our peak levels of traffic over the course of the typical year vary by route; the East Coast to Florida/Caribbean routes peak from October through April and the West Coast routes peak in the summer months. Generally speaking, many of our areas of operations in the Northeast experience poor winter weather conditions, resulting in increased costs associated with de-icing aircraft, canceled flights, and accommodating displaced customers. Many of our Florida and Caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes. As we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses by other airlines. 
Our flying in 2021 and 2020 did not follow typical historical patterns and was instead shaped by our responses to the changes in travel behavior triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated government travel and other restrictions in the U.S. and international destinations we serve. 
•New York metropolitan area - We are New York's Hometown Airline®. Approximately one-half of our flights originate from or are destined for the New York metropolitan area. JFK is New York's largest airport, and we are the 
second largest airline at JFK as measured by domestic seats. Our 2021 operations accounted for 37% of seats offered on domestic routes from JFK. At the end of 2021, we served 87 nonstop destinations from JFK. We also serve New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, or Newark, New York City's LaGuardia Airport, or LaGuardia, New York's Stewart International Airport, or Newburgh, and New York's Westchester County Airport, or White Plains. In 2022, through the NEA with American, we expect to offer nearly 300 daily departures at JFK, with JetBlue operating approximately 200 flights. At LaGuardia, we anticipate increasing our service to over 50 daily departures, which would triple pre-pandemic levels. 
•Boston - We are the largest carrier at Boston's Logan International Airport, or Boston, measured by domestic seats. At the end of 2021, we flew to 69 nonstop destinations from Boston and our operations accounted for 29% of all seats offered in Boston. We anticipate flying up to 150 daily departures in 2022 from Boston. We further expect to begin services between Boston and London in the summer of 2022. Together with American, the NEA will offer more than 200 daily departures at Boston, serving 46 of the top 50 U.S. mainland markets from Boston. 
•Caribbean and Latin America - At the end of 2021, we had 37 BlueCities in the Caribbean and Latin America. San Juan, Puerto Rico is our only focus city outside of the Continental U.S. We are a leading carrier in Puerto Rico serving three airports and 20 nonstop destinations. We are also the largest airline in the Dominican Republic, serving four airports and 17 nonstop destinations. 
•Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood - We are a leading carrier at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, or Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, with approximately 20% of all seats offered in 2021. We served 55 nonstop destinations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood at the end of 2021.
•Orlando - We are the leading carrier measured by seats at Orlando International Airport, or Orlando. At the end of 2021, we served 28 nonstop destinations from Orlando and our operations accounted for 10% of all seats offered in Orlando in 2021. 
•Los Angeles area - We are the seventh largest carrier in the Los Angeles area measured by seats, operating from Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, Burbank's Bob Hope Airport, or Burbank, and Ontario International Airport, or Ontario. In July 2020, we announced our plans to make LAX a focus city and our primary base of operations on the west coast. To enable this shift, we relocated our operations from Long Beach Airport along with our crew and maintenance bases in October 2020. At the end of 2021, we served 24 nonstop destinations from LAX and our operations accounted for 6% of all seats offered in 2021. 
Fleet Structure
We currently operate five types of aircraft: Airbus A220, Airbus A320, Airbus A321, Airbus A321neo, and Embraer E190. As of December 31, 2021, our fleet had an average age of 11.6 years. 
Our Airbus A220 aircraft have 140 seats in a single cabin layout. We placed our first Airbus A220 aircraft into service in April 2021 and had eight of these aircraft in our fleet at December 31, 2021. 
Our Airbus A320 aircraft in the classic configuration have 150 seats. Those A320 aircraft which have gone through our cabin restyling program have 162 seats. Our multi-year restyling program allows us to increase capacity in a capital-efficient and customer-focused way. As of December 31, 2021, we had 113 restyled Airbus A320 aircraft in service. We expect the cabin restyling program to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. 
Our Airbus A321 aircraft in a single cabin layout have 200 seats and those with our Mint® offering have 159 seats. Our Airbus A321neo aircraft have 200 seats and those with our Mint® offering have 160 seats. The long range version of our A321neo aircraft with Mint® offering have 138 seats while our Embraer E190 aircraft have 100 seats. 
The reliability of our fleet is essential to ensuring our operations run efficiently and we are continually working with our aircraft and engine manufacturers to enhance our performance.
Fleet Maintenance
Consistent with our core value of safety, our FAA-approved maintenance programs are administered by our technical operations department. We use qualified maintenance personnel and ensure they have comprehensive training. We maintain our aircraft and associated maintenance records in accordance with, if not exceeding, FAA regulations. We temporarily parked a portion of our fleet throughout 2020 due to the reduction in demand expectations and lower capacity driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we began returning these aircraft back into service as demand for air travel started to rebound signaling the beginnings of a recovery. All parked aircraft were returned to service by the end of November 2021.
 Fleet maintenance work is divided into three categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component maintenance.
The bulk of our line maintenance is handled by JetBlue technicians and inspectors. It consists of daily checks, overnight and weekly checks, or "A" checks, diagnostics, and routine repairs. 
Heavy maintenance checks, or "C" checks, consist of a series of more complex tasks taking from one to four weeks to complete and are typically performed once every 15 months. All of our aircraft heavy maintenance work is performed by third party FAA-approved facilities and are subject to direct oversight by JetBlue personnel. We outsource heavy maintenance as the costs are lower than if we performed the tasks internally. 
Component maintenance on equipment such as engines, auxiliary power units, landing gears, pumps, and avionic computers are all performed by a number of different FAA-approved third party repair stations. We have time and materials agreements for the repair, overhaul, modification, and logistics of our Airbus aircraft engines. We also have maintenance agreements for our Embraer E190, Airbus A220, and Airbus A321neo aircraft engines. Many of our maintenance service agreements are based on a fixed cost per flight hour. These fixed costs vary based upon the age of the aircraft and other operating factors impacting the related component. Required maintenance not otherwise covered by these agreements is performed on a time and materials basis. All other maintenance activities are sub-contracted to qualified maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities. 
Aircraft Fuel
Aircraft fuel continues to be one of our largest expenses. Its price has been extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors which we can neither control nor accurately predict. Our 2021 fuel consumption increased by 68.9% compared to 2020 due to lower capacity in 2020 as demand for travel declined significantly as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use third parties to assist with fuel management service and to procure most of our fuel. Our historical fuel consumption and costs for the years ended December 31 were:

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Gallons consumed (millions) | 696 | | | 412 | | | 885 | 
Total cost (millions)(1) | $ | 1,436 | | | $ | 631 | | | $ | 1,847
Average price per gallon(1) | $ | 2.06 | | | $ | 1.53 | | | $ | 2.09 
Percent of operating expenses | 23.5 | % | | 13.5 | % | | 25.3 | %

(1) Total cost and average price per gallon each include related fuel taxes as well as effective fuel hedging gains and losses.
We attempt to protect ourselves against the volatility of fuel prices by entering into a variety of derivative instruments. These include call spread options, call options, swaps, caps, collars, and basis swaps with underlyings of jet fuel, crude and heating oil. We did not have any derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Financial Health
We strive to maintain financial strength and a cost structure that enables us to grow profitably and sustainably. In the first years of our history, we relied on financing activities to fund much of our growth. Starting in 2007, our growth has largely been funded through internally generated cash from operations.
In response to the travel restrictions, decreased demand, and other effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Company's business, we secured over $4 billion in net proceeds through various debt and equity financing activities in 2020 to provide additional liquidity which allowed us to navigate through the pandemic in the short-term.
 In 2021, as we began to recover from the pandemic, we made significant efforts in deleveraging the Company and strengthening our balance sheet. We reduced our total debt balance by $0.9 billion from $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020 to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The net book value of our assets pledged as security under various financing arrangements also decreased by $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020, to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2021.
As a result of our actions, the outlook for our credit ratings improved to "Positive" at each of the three major credit rating agencies in 2021.
We will continue to evaluate our financing needs as we continue to navigate through the pandemic and related recovery.

With its Inspiration Center headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, we believe JetBlue Travel Products will play an important role in delivering our vision of inspiring humanity, extending our reach further across the travel ribbon to offer customers an even more seamless travel experience. 
In March 2021, we introduced Paisly by JetBlue ("Paisly"), a new travel website that leverages smart technology to provide individually tailored offers, such as hotel stays and car rentals, to our customers based on their itinerary. Paisly was designed to complement our JetBlue Vacations® brand. We believe it will add breadth to our product offerings, learn more about customers' preferences, and contribute to future earnings growth.
TWA Flight Center Hotel 
In 2015, the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, or the PANYNJ approved a construction plan to redevelop the TWA Flight Center at JFK on its nearly six-acre site into a hotel with over 500 rooms, meeting spaces, restaurants, a spa and an observation deck. As part of the plan, a 75-year lease agreement was entered into between the PANYNJ and the Flight Center Hotel, LLC, a partnership of MCR Development, LLC and JetBlue. The TWA Flight Center Hotel opened for business in 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we have an approximate 10% ownership interest in the hotel.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Our People and Culture
We believe our success depends on our crewmembers delivering the JetBlue Experience in the sky and on the ground. One of our competitive strengths is a service oriented culture grounded in our five key values: safety, caring, integrity, passion, and fun. We believe a highly productive and engaged workforce enhances customer loyalty. Our goal is to hire, train, and retain a diverse workforce of caring, passionate, fun, and friendly people who share our mission to inspire humanity.
We first introduce our culture to new crewmembers during the screening process and then at an extensive new hire orientation program at JetBlue University, our training center in Orlando. Orientation focuses on the JetBlue strategy and emphasizes the importance of customer service, productivity, and cost control. We provide continuous training for our crewmembers including technical training, various leadership training programs, and regular training focused on the safety value and front line training for our customer service teams. 
Our growth plans necessitate and facilitate opportunities for talent development. Known as JetBlue Gateways, we offer a suite of industry-leading career development programs that provides an opportunity for both crewmembers and external applicants to pursue a path to becoming a pilot or maintenance technician at JetBlue. There are seven distinct education and training paths offered:
•Gateway University: Open to crewmembers and external applicants, students at Aviation Accreditation Board International accredited partner colleges and universities can become first officers via a prescribed, time-building pathway.
•Gateway Select: Open to crewmembers and external applicants, candidates with little or no flying experience can become pilots after a rigorous training and time-building program.
•Gateway Direct - Flight Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants can depart on a prescribed college education, training, and time-building pathway with a partner school and airline to becoming a pilot.
•Gateway Flex - Flight Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants looking for flexibility in becoming a pilot can choose their own location for training and time-building within a defined framework.
•Gateway Direct - Technical Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants enroll in a defined training and experience-building pathway to becoming an aircraft maintenance technician.
•Gateway Flex - Technical Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants can depart their current position and pursue a flexible path to becoming an aircraft maintenance technician within a defined framework.
•Gateway Family: Open to families of crewmembers only, participants can become pilots through a defined education, training, and time-building path.
We believe a direct relationship between crewmembers and our leadership is in the best interests of our crewmembers, our customers, and our stockholders. Except for our pilots and inflight crewmembers, our other frontline crewmembers do not have third-party representation. In 2014, JetBlue pilots elected to be represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA. The National Mediation Board, or NMB, certified ALPA as the representative for JetBlue pilots. The parties reached a final agreement for our first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by the pilots in July 2018. The agreement is a four-year renewable contract effective August 1, 2018. In February 2022, the parties commenced Section 6 negotiations for a successor contract, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. 
In April 2018, JetBlue inflight crewmembers elected to be represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU. The NMB certified the TWU as the representative for JetBlue inflight crewmembers. The parties reached a final agreement for the first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by our inflight crewmembers in December 2021. The agreement is a five-year, renewable contract effective December 13, 2021. 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 46 percent of our full-time equivalent crewmembers were represented by unions. The following table sets forth our crewmember groups and the status of their respective collective bargaining agreements.
 
Crewmember Group | Representative | Crewmembers(1) | Amendable Date(2)
Pilots | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 3,850 | August 1, 2022 
Inflight | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 4,833 | December 13, 2026

(1) Approximate number of active full-time equivalent crewmembers as of December 31, 2021.
(2) Our relations with our labor organizations are governed by Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, pursuant to which the collective bargaining agreements between us and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a certain date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
We have individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA licensed crewmembers which consist of dispatchers, technicians, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and renews for an additional five-year term. In the event of a downturn in our business, resulting in a reduction of flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. We provide what we believe to be industry-leading job protection through these agreements. We believe these agreements provide JetBlue and crewmembers flexibility and allow us to react to crewmember needs more efficiently than collective bargaining agreements.
A key feature of the direct relationship with our crewmembers is our Values Committees which are made up of peer-elected frontline crewmembers from each of our major work groups, other than pilots and inflight crewmembers. Values Committees represent the interests of our workgroups and help us run our business in a productive and efficient manner. We believe this direct relationship with crewmembers drives higher levels of engagement and alignment with JetBlue’s strategy, culture, and overall goals.
We believe the efficiency and engagement of our crewmembers is a result of our flexible and productive work rules. We are cognizant of the competition for productive labor in key industry positions and new government rules requiring higher qualifications as well as more restricted hours that may result in potential labor shortages in the upcoming years. In 2021, we saw upward pressure on wages within many of the markets we serve and this trend is expected to continue in 2022. 
Our leadership team communicates on a regular basis with all crewmembers in order to maintain a direct relationship and to keep them informed about news, strategy updates, and challenges affecting the airline and the industry. Effective and frequent communication throughout the organization is fostered through various means including email messages from our CEO and other senior leaders at least weekly, weekday news updates to all crewmembers, crewmember engagement surveys, and active leadership participation in new hire orientations. Leadership is also heavily involved in periodic open forum meetings across our network, called “pocket sessions” which are often videotaped and posted on our intranet. By soliciting feedback for ways to improve our service, teamwork and work environment, our leadership team works to keep crewmembers engaged and makes our business decisions transparent. 
In 2021, we launched two development programs focused on creating greater access to select career paths, fostering equity by removing barriers to entry and increasing representation in senior leadership roles. One of the programs, known as JetBlue Emerging Talent, offers a pathway for our frontline operational crewmembers to transition into corporate services roles which includes hands-on experience, rotational job placements, and job placement assistance upon completion of the program. We welcomed the first cohort of 12 participants rotating through the organization in 2021. The other program, known as Gateway College, provides opportunities to crewmembers with aspiration to pursue careers in flight operations or technical operations. Gateway College was designed to alleviate some of the known barriers to entry for these careers such as financing and fears of leaving a permanent job, while adding certainty and a defined pathway to the process. We welcomed 25 inflight and technical operations participants through this program in 2021. 
Our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of 3,744 pilots, 4,381 inflight (whom other airlines may refer to as flight attendants), 3,591 airport operations personnel, 706 technicians (whom other airlines may refer to as mechanics), 1,103 reservation agents, and 3,168 management and other personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we employed an average of 15,452 full-time and 4,014 part-time crewmembers.
Our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers increased by 8.0% compared to 2020, primarily driven by additional hiring, as we prepare to return our operations to pre-pandemic levels. As a result of the various voluntary separation and time off programs implemented in response to the drastic decline in demand for air travel brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers in 2020 was lower than previous years. When compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, our average full-time equivalent crewmembers decreased by 9.9%. 
All JetBlue crewmembers have the right to an open and respectful workplace. Our Code of Conduct prohibits all forms of discrimination, and we promote open communication to resolve any discrimination concerns. Every JetBlue director-level crewmember and above is required to participate in unconscious bias training.
Crewmember Programs
We are committed to supporting our crewmembers through a number of programs including: 
•Crewmember Resource Groups (CRGs) - We encourage crewmembers to celebrate their individuality and build camaraderie through our various CRGs. CRGs spearhead programs to embrace and encourage the sharing of different perspectives, thoughts, and ideas. At the end of 2021, we had seven CRGs which include:
◦Blue Aviasian: Celebrates the history of Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group offers immersive cultural experiences, networking, and career development events.
◦Blue Conexión: Shares the Latino culture and language in the workplace and community.
◦JADE (JetBlue African Diaspora Experience): Explores the rich cultures of the African diaspora. JADE leads cultural events during Black History Month and hosts TravelCon, a day-long event for crewmembers to learn about the diverse experience of Black travelers, among other events.
◦JetPride: Offers professional development opportunities for LGBTQ+ crewmembers and their allies. During Pride Month, crewmembers march across the network to celebrate diversity, equality and acceptance.
◦SAJE (South Asian JetBlue Experience): Created in 2021, SAJE shines a light on the immensely diverse cultures and communities that make up south Asia. It provides an opportunity for our crewmembers who identify as South Asian to connect with one another, and for all crewmembers to better understand their unique backgrounds, culture, and experiences. 
◦Vets in Blue: Provides a forum for crewmembers who honorably serve or have served in the Armed Forces. Vets in Blue strengthens JetBlue’s efforts to employ and retain members of the military through outreach, networking events, career fairs, and mentoring opportunities. Many former service members enjoy second careers with JetBlue in airport operations, corporate security, inflight, flight operations and more.
◦Women in Flight: Provides members with educational networking opportunities that inspire career and personal growth. Typically, the group hosts our annual Fly Like a Girl event, teaching young girls about different career paths in aviation. 
◦JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund (JCCF) - This organization, originally formed in 2002, is a non-profit corporation independent from JetBlue and recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt entity. JCCF was created to assist JetBlue crewmembers and their immediate family members (IRS Dependents) with short-term financial support in times of crisis and unexpected emergencies when other resources are not available. Funds for JCCF grants come directly from crewmember donations via a tax-deductible payroll deduction. The assistance process is confidential with only the fund administrator and coordinator knowing the identity of the crewmembers in need.
•JetBlue Scholars - Developed in 2015, this program offers a new and innovative model to our crewmembers wishing to further their education. Crewmembers enrolled in the program can earn an undergraduate degree through self-directed online college courses facilitated by JetBlue. This reemphasizes our continuous effort to help provide assistance to our most valued asset, our people. To build on the program, we introduced the Master's Pathway program in 2019 which is designed to help crewmembers who would like to advance their education even further by pursuing a master's degree. The Master's Pathway program partners with reputable institutions to provide a variety of benefits to crewmembers including tuition discounts, scholarships, and access to specialized support services.
• Lift Recognition Program - Created in 2012, this crewmember recognition program encourages crewmembers to celebrate their peers for living JetBlue's values by sending e-thanks through an on-line platform. Our leadership team periodically hosts an event for the crewmembers who receive the highest number of Lift award recognitions in each quarter of the year.
Community Programs
JetBlue is committed to supporting the communities and BlueCities we serve through a variety of community programs including:
•Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - The CSR strategy, JetBlue For Good, focuses on three areas that our customers and crewmembers are passionate about: (1) youth and education, (2) community, and (3) environment. 
◦Youth and Education: As a pillar of JetBlue For Good, our youth and education efforts focus on providing children from underserved areas the resources needed to obtain a quality education and sustainable careers. We do this through various initiatives including donating age-appropriate books to areas where books are scarce outside of school walls. We also host regular career days that help expose young adults to the careers available to them upon graduation and beyond.
◦Community: We have a longstanding tradition of supporting dedicated community organizations that make our BlueCities better. We show our support through partnerships, donations and more than the 1 million-plus volunteer hours logged by our crewmembers since 2011.
◦Environment: JetBlue’s primary environmental sustainability priority is reducing and managing carbon emissions from jet fuel. We are committed to investing in more fuel-efficient technologies, renewable fuels, electric ground service equipment, logistics and other measures to reduce our carbon footprint.
•JetBlue Foundation - Created in 2013 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, the JetBlue Foundation is a JetBlue-sponsored organization focused on raising awareness for careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and aviation. The JetBlue Foundation focuses on four main areas:
◦Partnering with organizations and communities to provide access to STEM programs for students from traditionally underserved communities;
◦Investing in programs geared toward students from diverse backgrounds to create a lifelong interest in STEM as early as possible in a student's academic career;
◦Creating equal opportunities and increasing access for all students to spark a passion for STEM; and
◦Building a more diverse talent pipeline for the aviation industry.
Environmental, Social, and Governance Management
Mitigating risks to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business is imperative for JetBlue. We remain focused on continuing to lead in environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") initiatives, through ambitious target setting, clear actions and strategy, and transparent reporting. 
Environmental 
JetBlue is committed to mitigating climate risk and our environmental vision is to lead the way toward a lower carbon future of aviation, with an ultimate target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. As one of our key company-wide strategic priorities, we are pursuing the following six key levers to decarbonize our business:
(1) Aircraft Efficiency: Our investments in new next generation aircraft is expected to increase fuel efficiency and reduce costs. The Airbus A321neo and Airbus A220 aircraft bring materially lower fuel burn and associated emissions per seat than the aircraft they are replacing. Since 2019, we have taken deliveries of 21 Airbus A321neo aircraft and 8 Airbus A220 aircraft. Going forward, we expect to take delivery of 64 Airbus A321neo aircraft and 92 Airbus A220 aircraft. 
(2) Fuel Optimization: We continuously fine-tune our operation to ensure adherence to fuel savings procedures. We operate a cross-functional team that reviews, analyzes, and implements new fuel-savings opportunities across our operation and multiple workgroups.
(3) Sustainable Aviation Fuel ("SAF"): We are regularly flying with SAF on our existing aircraft, which reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 80% per gallon before being blended with conventional fuel. We view the adoption of SAF as the most promising means for us to rapidly and directly reduce emissions in the aviation industry and drive us towards a net-zero operation. Enabled by our recent agreements with three SAF producers, we expect to be ahead of schedule to achieve our goal of converting 10% of our jet fuel usage to SAF by 2030.
(4) Electric Ground Operations: Where feasible, we are converting our Ground Service Equipment ("GSE") to electric and maximizing electric ground power and air systems for our aircraft to minimize our fuel use and emissions on the ramp. We are committed to converting 40% of our GSE to electric by 2025, and 50% by 2030. We do not expect this conversion program to have a material impact on our annual capital expenditures.
(5) Technology Partnerships: We are committed to playing an active role in advancing the future of sustainable aviation technologies. Through our subsidiary, JetBlue Technology Ventures, we support and invest in alternative energy aircraft technologies, such as those developing electric- and hydrogen-fueled aircraft.
(6) Carbon Offsetting: For unavoidable emissions today, we purchase high-quality, verified offsets. The costs of these offsets are included within Aircraft fuel and related taxes on our consolidated statements of operations.
In 2020, we became the first major U.S. airline to achieve carbon neutrality for all domestic flights, which was achieved through carbon offsetting. Our target is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement. We are committed to continuously driving down in-sector emissions and our associated usage of carbon offsets as we approach net-zero.
We view the adoption of SAF as the most promising lever for the aviation industry to reach its ambitious decarbonization goals. Throughout 2021, we took regular delivery of SAF from Neste for flights flying out of San Francisco International Airport. In July 2021, we entered into a relationship with World Energy and World Fuel Services to fuel flights flying out of Los Angeles International Airport with SAF. In September 2021, we announced an agreement with SG Preston which we expect will deliver at least 670 million gallons of SAF in the Northeast over a 10-year period with a target start in the fourth quarter of 2023. Enabled by our recent agreements, we believe we are ahead of pace to achieve our goal of converting 10% of our jet fuel usage to SAF by 2030.
In October 2021, we, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures, formed the Aviation Climate Task force with nine other airlines and the Boston Consulting Group. Together, we plan to invest in and facilitate the development of emerging technologies to decarbonize aviation.
Social
Every day we aim to live our mission of inspiring humanity by driving inclusion both inside and outside the Company. While we recognize that there is a lack of diversity in certain areas of the commercial aviation industry, we are taking steps to address that challenge.
Our efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") are centered around three key areas: (1) people; (2) sourcing; and (3) brand. 
•People
◦Develop a hiring process that mitigates harmful biases in order to improve representation of talent at all levels of the Company. 
◦Educate and inform on DEI through informal learning and review of practices and policies.
◦Focus on our people, continue to promote and invest in diverse talent.
◦Our goal is to double our racial and ethnic minority representation at the officer and director level to 25%, and to increase our female representation at these levels to 40%, by the end of 2025.
•Sourcing
◦Engage minority and women-owned business enterprises with a proven commitment to DEI in their lines of business. Our goal is to grow our spend with businesses owned by underrepresented groups by 5% annually. In 2021, we engaged with 158 diverse business partners and spent $37 million with diverse businesses.
•Brand
◦Ensure inclusivity in our offerings by capturing the diverse needs across our customer base.
◦Partner with values-aligned businesses and organizations within the communities we serve.
◦Evaluate social and market shifts and their impact on our customers' experience.
Governance
We believe that strong corporate governance, informed by direct engagement with our stakeholders, creates the foundation that allows us to pursue our mission to inspire humanity. We strive to conduct our business in ways that are principled, transparent, and accountable to our stakeholders.
We regularly develop, evaluate, and reshape company policies and procedures to ensure fairness and alignment to our values. We take a proactive approach to tracking, operationalization, and mitigation of risks JetBlue faces. This includes climate risk scenario planning and internal response protocols in response to ESG trends. We are dedicated to disclosing accurate data across a variety of material topics such as governance, executive pay, company emissions, and workforce diversity.
Our Board of Directors ("Board") has ultimate oversight of enterprise risks and is informed of these risks quarterly by the Audit Committee and at least annually by the Governance and Nominating Committee. In 2019, our Board formed an ESG Subcommittee to the Governance and Nominating Committee to ensure the Board is aware of the Company's ESG strategy and has a comprehensive understanding of ESG matters, which we continued to operate throughout 2021.
We report annually on ESG issues using the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures frameworks. Our Environmental Social Governance Report can be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.jetblue.com. 
Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to prioritize the safety of our crewmembers while continuing to support the needs of our operations during this period. Some of the steps we have taken since the onset of the pandemic include:    
•Introduced "Safety from the Ground Up", an initiative with a multi-layer approach that encompasses enhanced safety and cleaning measures on our flights, at our airports, and in our offices;
•Instituted temperature checks for all of our customer-facing and support-center crewmembers;
•Updated our sick leave policy to provide up to 14 days of paid sick leave for crewmembers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or were required to quarantine;
•Partnered with Northwell Direct to provide a comprehensive set of COVID-19 services and programs to support our crewmembers;
•Implemented a framework for internal contact tracing, crewmember notification, and a return to work clearance process for all crewmembers, wherever they may be located;
•Administered more frequent disinfecting of common surfaces and areas with high touchpoints in our facilities; and
•Conducted regular virtual "pocket sessions" to provide company-wide updates to our crewmembers as we navigate through the pandemic. 
As a result of a federal government vaccine mandate, and by virtue of JetBlue being a contractor to the federal government, our crewmembers may be required to be vaccinated against the SARS-Cov-2 novel coronavirus unless an approved medical or religious accommodation is granted. As a result, we may face staffing shortages as we enforce this mandate, which may disrupt our operations. 

REGULATION
Airlines are heavily regulated, with rules and regulations set by various federal, state and local agencies. We also operate under specific regulations due to our operations within the high density airspace of the northeast U.S. Most of our airline operations are regulated by U.S. governmental agencies including:
DOT - The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service including, but not limited to, certification and fitness, insurance, consumer protection and competitive practices. It has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, including its tarmac delay, full fare advertising and fair and deceptive practice regulations, and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions for various levels and manners of non-compliance.
FAA - The FAA primarily regulates flight operations, in particular, matters affecting air safety. This includes but is not limited to airworthiness requirements for aircraft, the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers, and the certification of flight attendants. It requires each airline to obtain an operating certificate authorizing the airline to operate at specific airports using specified equipment. Like all U.S. certified carriers, JetBlue cannot fly to new destinations without the prior authorization of the FAA. After providing notice and a hearing, the FAA has the authority to modify, suspend temporarily or revoke permanently our authority to provide air transportation or that of our licensed personnel for failure to comply with FAA regulations. It can additionally assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations. When significant safety issues are involved, it can revoke a U.S. carrier's authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing. It monitors our compliance with maintenance as well as flight operations and safety regulations. It maintains a requisite level of oversight and performs frequent in-person spot inspections of our aircraft, crewmembers and records. The FAA also has the authority to issue airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders. This includes the inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, collision and wind shear avoidance systems, noise abatement, and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. We have and maintain FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft and have the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the destinations we currently serve. 
Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection - The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, and the U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection, or CBP, operate under the Department of Homeland Security and are responsible for all civil aviation security. This includes passenger and baggage screening; cargo security measures; airport security; assessment and distribution of intelligence; security research and development; international passenger screening; customs; and agriculture. It also has law enforcement powers and the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of national emergency, without a notice or comment period. It can also assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain regulations. 
Taxes & Fees - The airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the U.S., with taxes and fees accounting for approximately 15% of the total fare charged to a customer. Airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer. The September 11 Security Fee which is set by the TSA and is passed through to the customer, is currently $5.60 per enplanement, regardless of the number of connecting flights and a round trip fee is limited to a maximum of $11.20. Effective December 28, 2015, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Aircraft Inspection fee increased from $70.75 to $225 per international aircraft arriving in the U.S.
State and Local - In addition to the federal regulations with which we must comply, we are also subject to state and local laws and regulations in the states in which we operate and the regulations of various local authorities operating the airports we serve.
Airport Access - JFK, LaGuardia, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, or Reagan National, are slot-controlled airports subject to the "High Density Rule" and successor rules issued by the FAA, or Slots. These rules were implemented due to the high volume of traffic at these popular airports located in the northeast corridor airspace. The rules limit the air traffic in and out of these airports during specific times; however, even with the rules in place, delays remain among the highest in the nation due to continuing airspace congestion. Additionally, we have Slots at other Slot-controlled airports governed by unique local ordinances not subject to the High Density Rule, such as Westchester County Airport in White Plains, NY. Gate access is another common issue at certain airports. 
Foreign Operations - International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The availability of international routes to U.S. airlines is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments. We currently operate international service to Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, England, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Saint Lucia, St. Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. We anticipate further expanding our network to Canada in 2022. To the extent we seek to provide air transportation to additional international markets in the future, we would be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and the FAA as well as 
the applicable foreign government. During 2021 and 2020, our flight operations to many of these countries were disrupted by travel restrictions that were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We believe we are operating in compliance with DOT, FAA, TSA, CBP and applicable international regulations as well as hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations and certificates. Should any of these authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended, or revoked, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Other
Environmental - We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. This includes the regulation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals, as well as the regulation of aircraft noise administered by numerous state and federal agencies.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures as long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with the interstate and foreign commerce of the national air transportation system. Certain airports, including San Diego airport in California, have established restrictions to limit noise which can include limits on the number of hourly or daily operations and the time of such operations. These limitations are intended to protect the local noise-sensitive communities surrounding the airport. Our scheduled flights at San Diego airport are in compliance with the noise curfew limits, but on occasion when we experience irregular operations, we may violate these curfews. 
Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and ground operations emissions. In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program intended to promote carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. Annual international emissions reporting is required via CORSIA as of the 2019 reporting year, and offsetting compliance is scheduled to be implemented through multiple phases beginning in 2021. In 2020, given the impacts of COVID-19 which dramatically reduced 2020 emissions, ICAO agreed that the baseline from which the industry achieves carbon neutral growth would be from 2019 only, rather than an average of 2019 and 2020 as originally intended. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but we expect compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
As part of our sustainability and environmental strategy, we are embracing new technologies and making changes that will ultimately benefit our crewmembers, customers, and stockholders. We discuss some of our sustainability initiatives in “—Environmental, Social Governance – Environmental” above.
Foreign Ownership - Under federal law and DOT regulations, JetBlue must be controlled by U.S. citizens. In this regard, our chief executive officer and at least two-thirds of our board of directors must be U.S. citizens. Further, no more than 24.99% of our outstanding common stock may be voted by non-U.S. citizens. We believe we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions.
Other Regulations - All airlines are subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 due to their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. They are also required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we take all necessary steps to comply with those requirements.
Additionally, as a result of our operations to Havana, Cuba, we are required to comply with regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
Our labor relations are covered under Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and are subject to the jurisdiction of the NMB. 
In addition, during periods of fuel scarcity, access to aircraft fuel may be subject to federal allocation regulations. 
Civil Reserve Air Fleet - We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize our aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. By participating in this program, we are eligible to bid on and be awarded peacetime airlift contracts with the U.S. military.
Insurance
We carry various types of insurance customary in the airline industry and at amounts deemed adequate to protect us and our property as well as comply with both federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements.
