ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Strategy
The cannabis industry is dynamic and becoming more mature. As markets like Colorado mature, we believe that an opportunity exists for operationally excellent companies to build scale by acquiring and operating licensed cannabis businesses. Accordingly, we are focused on (1) identifying licensed cannabis assets that we can acquire, (2) focusing on execution, which will allow us to continue to generate cash and meet our financial commitments, and (3) moving with an urgency that reflects our conviction and confidence in our ability to create the customers’ loyalty and advocacy. To that end, during the years ended 2021 and 2020, we implemented the following significant actions in support of our continued growth:

● | On December 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Trees Portland, LLC and Trees Waterfront, LLC, representing a portion of the overall Trees transaction ("Trees Transaction”). The cash paid in connection with the Oregon Closing consisted of $331,581 and stock consideration of 6,423,575 shares of our Common Stock. Further, cash equal to $497,371 will be paid to sellers in equal monthly installments over a period of 24 months from the Oregon Closing.

● | On September 10, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with various accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold Units consisting of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) and warrants (“Warrants”) to purchase shares of our common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”). The total number of Units sold was 1,180. Each Unit consists of one (1) share of Series A Preferred and 300 Warrants. The purchase price of each Unit was $1,000, for an aggregate amount sold of $1,180,000. Each share of Series A Preferred is convertible into 1,000 shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a capital raise of at least $5 million.

● | On September 2, 2021, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of TDM, LLC, representing a portion of the overall Trees transaction. The cash paid by the Company consisted of $1,155,256. We issued 22,380,310 shares of our Common Stock. Further, cash equal to $1,732,884 will be paid to Seller in equal monthly installments over a period of 24 months.

● | On July 16, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with NBC Holdings LLC and Richard Cardinal (“Buyer”) pursuant to which we agreed to sell substantially all the assets in our cultivation consulting business known as Next Big Crop (“NBC”) to Buyer. The Board of Directors approved the Agreement in furtherance of its previously disclosed plan to identify and acquire licensed cannabis assets that will allow us to continue to generate cash and meet our financial commitments. The purchase price for the sale consists of a payment by Buyer of $75,000 payable upon signing, an additional $75,000 payable within one year of the closing, and ten percent (10%) of profits generated by Buyer in the states of Michigan, Mississippi and Massachusetts for a period of twelve months from the Closing. Pursuant to amendment, Buyer paid the additional $75,000 in March 2022, and the 10% profit share described above was eliminated.

● | On April 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation among the Company, Trees Acquisition Corp., a newly-formed indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and TDM, LLC and Station 2, LLC (“Colorado Sellers”), as well as a separate Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation among the Company, Trees Acquisition, and Trees Waterfront, LLC, Trees MLK Inc. and Trees Portland, LLC (“Oregon Sellers” and collectively with the Colorado Sellers, the “Sellers”) (collectively, the “Plans”). Pursuant to the Plans, we agreed to purchase substantially all the assets of each of the Colorado Sellers and Oregon Sellers. The assets principally consist of the cannabis business licenses, inventory, and intellectual property related to the Sellers’ cannabis dispensaries located in Englewood and Denver, Colorado and Portland, Oregon together with substantially all related assets. We are not assuming any

liabilities of any of the Sellers. The purchase price for the transaction consists of a cash payment of $2 million at closing, and an additional $3 million in cash payable in equal monthly amounts of $125,000 for a period of 24 months from the closing. In the event we consummate a capital raise of $5 million or greater during such 24-month period, such monthly payments will increase to $200,000 per month and the payout period decreases to 15 months from the closing, with a one-time ‘catch-up’ payment such that the total additional cash consideration equals $3 million. In addition, at the closing, we will issue to the Sellers 38,745,193 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Seller Shares”).

● | On April 20, 2021, we completed an offering with accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.3 million to such Investors (“Offering”). The notes are part of an over-allotment approved by the existing noteholders in connection with the original convertible note offering (and previous over-allotment) of $4.6 million consummated on December 23, 2020, and February 8, 2021. In connection with the Offering, each holder received warrants to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 20% coverage of the aggregate principal amount at $0.56 per share, except that the warrant coverage to one investor acting as lead investor in the Offering received approximately 35.5% of the aggregate principal amount invested. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10% and will mature on April 20, 2024. The investors have the option to convert up to 50% of the outstanding unpaid principal and accrued interest of the notes into Common Stock at a variable price of 80% of the market price but no less than $0.65 per share and no more than $1.00 per share.

● | On December 23, 2020, and February 8, 2021, the Company issued and sold senior convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $4,600,000 in exchange for payment to the Company by certain investors of an aggregate amount of $3,600,000 in cash, as well as cancellation of outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 represented by certain of the prior promissory notes issued by the Company in February 2020 to certain other investors. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the holders received warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock equal to 20% coverage of the aggregate principal amount at $0.56 per share. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10%. Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,940,000 will mature on December 23, 2023, and notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1,660,000 will mature on February 8, 2024. The investors have the option at any time to convert up to 50% of the outstanding unpaid principal and accrued interest of the notes into the Company’s common stock at a variable price of 80% of the market price but no less than $0.65 per share and no more than $1.00 per share.

● | On May 29, 2020, we entered into a subscription agreement, as amended with Hershey Strategic Capital, LP and Shore Ventures III, LP (collectively the “Hershey Investor”) with respect to the sale of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $3,000,000 of securities to the Hershey Investor, representing 7,532,010 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 5,649,007 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.5565 per share. In accordance with the terms of the subscription agreement, we issued an additional 1,631,000 warrants in December 2020 to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $0.4917 to the Hershey Investor. As part of these transactions, Adam Hershey joined our Board of Directors in July 2020.

● | On May 13, 2020, we received approval of the transaction and transfer of the Dalton Adventures, LLC (“Seller”) license from the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division (“the MED”). On May 25, 2020, we finalized the acquisition, pursuant to which we acquired the assets of the Seller that constitute the business of SevenFive Farm, a cultivation facility located in Boulder, Colorado. The purchase price paid by the Company to the Seller was 8,859,117 shares of common stock. Barker Dalton, the sole member and owner of Dalton Adventures, LLC, joined our Board of Directors in September 2020.

We determined the sale of our operations consulting and products segment represented a strategic shift that had a significant effect on our results of operations and, as a result, we have presented the disposal as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Unless noted otherwise, discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K pertains to our continuing operations. 
History and Corporate Structure
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of GCC and its nine wholly-owned subsidiary companies: (a) 6565 E. Evans Owner LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2014; (b) General Cannabis Capital Corporation, a Colorado corporation formed in 2015; (c) GC Security LLC (“GCS”), a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2015; (d) Standard Cann, Inc., a Colorado corporation formed in 2019; (e) SevenFive Farm LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2020; (f) SevenFive Farm Cultivation LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2020; (g) Trees Colorado LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2021; (h) Trees Oregon LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2021; (i) GC Corp., a Colorado corporation, originally formed in 2013 under the name ACS Corp. In 2015, the name was changed to GC Corp.
Our Products, Services and Customers
Through our reporting segments (Operations, Cultivation, and Investments), we provide products, services, and capital to the regulated cannabis industry and non-cannabis customers, which include the following:
Retail (“Retail Segment”)
Through our acquisition of TDM, LLC (“TREES Englewood”) in September 2021 and our acquisition of Trees Portland, LLC (“TREES Portland”) and Trees Waterfront, LLC (“TREES Waterfront”) in December 2021, we operate a retail dispensary store in Englewood, Colorado, and two retail stores in Portland, Oregon.
Cultivation (“Cultivation Segment”)
Through our acquisition of SevenFive Farm ("SevenFive") in May 2020, we operate a licensed light deprivation greenhouse cultivation facility. During 2021 and 2020, 31% and 28%, respectively, of SevenFive Farm’s revenue was from two customers. 
Competitive Strengths 
​
We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we operate:
Experience. Our management teams have extensive experience with a proven track record of success in developing, launching, and managing grow operations and retail dispensaries.
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to growing through strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy is to pursue alliances with potential targets that have the ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs, and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. 
Regulatory Compliance. The state and local laws regulating the cannabis industry change at a rapid pace. We have resources committed to ensure our operations comply with all state and local laws, policies, guidance, and regulations to which we are subject. We apply this compliance knowledge to our customers to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance.

6



Industry Knowledge. We continue to create, share, and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has business expertise, extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry, and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge.
Competition
Overall, we believe we have a competitive advantage by providing a range of goods and services to the cannabis industry. This allows us to provide integrated solutions to our customers, as well as sell additional goods and services to customers of a single segment. However, there is no aspect of our business that is protected by patents or copyrights. 
Retail. We will compete with a variety of different operators across the states in which we operate. In most of such states, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. However, in some markets, such as Colorado, there are few caps on licenses creating a more open marketplace. 
Cultivation. The Colorado cultivation market is highly fragmented. There are over one million cannabis plants cultivated for cannabis sales each year, and a typical 15,000 to 20,000 square foot grow facility contains approximately 5,000 to 7,500 plants. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to identify and acquire additional cultivation assets, which will ultimately supply our own proprietary brands and retail locations.
Government and Industry Regulation
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession, and/or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) describes Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to state-regulated cannabis activities in Colorado and other states, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
Considering the conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations (see “-- FinCEN”). The policies of the Obama administration concerning federal law enforcement regarding cannabis, notwithstanding the rescission of the Cole Memo (see below), continued during the Trump administration and we expect them to be continued during the Biden administration.
Congress previously enacted an omnibus spending bill that included a provision (the “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment”) prohibiting the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. This provision is renewed annually by Congress and is current through September 30, 2021. In August 2016, a Ninth Circuit federal appeals court ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law. In March 2015, bipartisan legislation titled the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) was introduced, proposing to allow states to regulate the medical use of cannabis by changing applicable federal law, including by reclassifying cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act to a Schedule II controlled substance and thereby changing 

7



the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer, or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties of the CSA.
These developments previously were met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry, but (i) neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 have yet been adopted, (ii) the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually, has not currently been renewed beyond September 30, 2021, and (iii) the ruling in United States v. McIntosh is only applicable precedent in the Ninth Circuit, which does not include Colorado, the state where we currently primarily operate.
Furthermore, on January 4, 2018, the former U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the “Sessions Memo”) stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
In response to the Sessions Memo, U.S. Attorney Bob Troy for the District of Colorado, the state in which our principal business operations are presently located, issued a statement on January 4, 2018, stating that the United States Attorney’s Office in Colorado is already guided by the well-established principles referenced in the Sessions Memo, “focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state. We will, consistent with the Attorney General’s latest guidance, continue to take this approach in all our work with our law enforcement partners throughout Colorado.”
It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo will be rescinded by the Biden administration; nor is it clear whether the Biden administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We currently cultivate, distribute, and sell cannabis. We may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government depending on the nature of such change. As of the date of this Report, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. Accordingly, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, which could lead to imprisonment and/or the imposition of penalties, fines, or forfeiture.
Recent legislative proposals have been introduced: 

● | Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment & Expungement Act (MORE Act). Reintroduced in 2021, the MORE Act aims to end criminalization of cannabis related past criminal penalties and convictions, and provide criminal justice reform, social justice, and economic development for those affected by the ‘war on drugs.’ The MORE Act would also tax cannabis products starting at 5% to 8% (increasing by 1% over five years). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | States Reform Act. This also seeks to decriminalize cannabis and provide retroactive expungement for non-violent federal cannabis offenses (except for persons involved in a drug cartel). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sensible Enforcement of Cannabis Act. This would protect cannabis businesses and consumers in states where cannabis has been legalized, while continuing the federal cannabis prohibition to remain in place in states where cannabis has not been legalized. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marijuana Revenue and Regulation Act. This would create a nationwide regulatory structure for legalizing cannabis and removing it from the CSA. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8




● | SAFE Banking Act. This would protect financial institutions that offer services to state-legal cannabis-related businesses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement Act (MORE Act). This would end the criminalization of cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the list of controlled substances in the CSA, as well as eliminating related criminal penalties. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

None of the above proposals have been enacted; and while the Biden administration appears to have a more friendly position toward legalization of cannabis generally than the Trump administration, it cannot presently be determined what position the current administration will take on either of these proposals.
The Cole Memo
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.
At the time of its issuance, the Cole Memo reiterated Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ was committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also noted that the DOJ was committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
​

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors;
--+----------------------------------------


● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis possession or use on federal property.
--+------------------------------------------------

Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
FinCEN
FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a “financial institution” includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:

● | bank (except bank credit card systems);
--+----------------------------------------


● | broker or dealer in securities;
--+--------------------------------


● | money services business;
--+-------------------------


● | telegraph company;
--+-------------------


● | card club; and
--+---------------

9




● | a person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on several factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.
In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business implicates one of the Cole Memo Enforcement Priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement’s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports. It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on customer due diligence by a financial institution.
While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients, and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain and is expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable, and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
Licensing and Local Regulations
Where applicable, we apply for state licenses or similar approvals that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. Our subsidiary, GC Corp., has been registered with the MED as an approved vendor since September 8, 2014. GCS, another subsidiary, has been registered as a MED approved vendor since March 11, 2015.
On May 1, 2020, the MED granted regulatory approval to the Company as a qualified and suitable buyer of licensed cannabis operations in the State. This authorization, known as a Suitability Approval, establishes the Company as one of the first public companies authorized to acquire licensed cultivation, manufacturing, and retail operations throughout Colorado.
Local laws at the county and municipal level add an additional layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a state’s adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis, counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to 

10



otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail, distribution, manufacturing or consumption.
Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county, or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum and may otherwise be restricted by state laws. For example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, discretionary approvals may be required for certain uses, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.
Human Capital
We are managed and operated by the Board of Directors and executive officers of General Cannabis Corp. As of December 31, 2021, we had 77 full-time employees. Executing our strategic vision requires that we attract and retain the best talent. The Company must appropriately reward high-performers and offer competitive benefits.  The Company offers comprehensive benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance for employees, their spouses or domestic partners, and their dependents. We also provide retirement programs, life insurance, family assistance, short-term disability and paid vacation and sick time. As a people-first company, our values help us achieve our purpose of cultivating an inclusive environment by hiring world-class individuals dedicated to fostering a culture that champions diversity, ensures equity, and celebrates inclusion. We provide opportunities for our employees to drive our strategy by creating programs that raise awareness, allowing courageous conversations and a more inclusive culture.
