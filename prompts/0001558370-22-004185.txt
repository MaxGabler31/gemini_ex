ITEM 1.     BUSINESS.
Summary
Epsilon Energy Ltd. (the “Company” or “Epsilon” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada March 14, 2005, pursuant to the ABCA. The Company is extra-provincially registered in Ontario pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). Epsilon is a North American on-shore focused independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the acquisition, development, gathering and production of natural gas and oil reserves. Our primary area of operation is Pennsylvania. Our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. On October 24, 2007, the Company became a publicly traded entity trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) in Canada. On February 14, 2019, Epsilon’s registration statement on Form 10 was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and on February 19, 2019, we began trading in the United States on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol “EPSN.” Effective as of the close of trading on March 15, 2019, Epsilon voluntarily delisted its common shares from the TSX. At December 31, 2021, Epsilon’s total estimated net proved reserves were 110,969 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas reserves, 819,726 barrels (Bbl) of NGL reserves, and 305,052 barrels (Bbl) of oil and other liquids. Epsilon holds leasehold rights to approximately 76,544 gross (13,176 net) acres. The Company has natural gas production in the Marcellus in Pennsylvania and oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma.
We conduct operations in the United States through our wholly owned subsidiaries Epsilon Energy USA Inc., an Ohio corporation, or Epsilon Energy USA; Epsilon Midstream, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, or Epsilon Midstream; Epsilon Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Dewey Energy GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Dewey Energy Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Altolisa Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
Substantially all of the production from our Pennsylvania acreage (4,597 net) is dedicated to the Auburn Gas Gathering System, or the Auburn GGS, located in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania for a 15-year term expiring in 2026 under an operating agreement whereby the Auburn GGS owners receive a fixed percentage rate of return on the total capital invested in the construction and maintenance of the system. We own a 35% interest in the Auburn GGS which is operated by a subsidiary of Williams Partners, LP. In 2021, we paid $1.6 million to the Auburn GGS to gather and treat our 9.8 Bcf of natural gas production in Pennsylvania ($1.8 million was paid to the Auburn GGS to gather and treat our 11.0 Bcf in 2020).
Our principal executive office is located at 16945 Northchase Drive, Suite 1610, Houston, Texas 77060, and our telephone number at that address is (281) 670-0002. Our registered office in Alberta, Canada is located at 14505 Bannister Road SE, Suite 300, Calgary, AB, Canada T2X 3J3.

Gathering System Operations
Epsilon Energy USA is the 100% owner of Epsilon Midstream, which owns a 35% undivided interest in the Auburn Gas Gathering System, or the Auburn GGS, located in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, with partners Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC (43.875%) and Equinor Pipelines, LLC (21.125%). The Anchor Shippers, Epsilon Energy, Equinor USA Onshore Properties, Inc., and Chesapeake Energy Corporation dedicated approximately 18,000 mineral acres to the Auburn GGS for an initial term of 15 years under an operating agreement whereby the Auburn GGS owners receive a fixed percentage rate of return on the total capital invested in the construction of the system.
The gathering rate of the Auburn gas gathering system (“Auburn GGS”) is determined by a cost of service model whereby the Anchor Shippers in the system dedicate acreage and reserves to the gas gathering system in exchange for the Auburn GGS owners agreeing to an 18% contractual rate of return on invested capital. The term of this arrangement is 15 years commencing January 1, 2012 and expiring December 31, 2026. Each year, the Auburn GGS historical and forecast throughput, revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures are entered into the cost of service model. The model then computes the new gathering rate that will yield the contractual rate of return to the Auburn GGS owners. In 2026, prior to the end of the initial period on December 31, a new agreement governing rates will be negotiated between the Anchor Shippers and the gathering system owners.

​




​
​

The Auburn GGS consists of approximately 44 miles of gathering pipelines, a small auxiliary compression facility and a main compression facility with three dehydration units and three Caterpillar 3612 compression units. Design capacity of the Auburn compression facility, or the Auburn CF, is approximately 330,000 Mcf per day. The Auburn CF delivers processed natural gas into the Tennessee Gas Pipeline at the Shoemaker Dehy receipt meter. The Auburn GGS is connected with the adjacent Rome GGS, which allows for the receipt of additional natural gas to maximize utilization of the Auburn CF and Tennessee Gas Pipeline meter capacity.
Revenues from the Auburn GGS are earned primarily from Anchor Shippers, Epsilon Energy USA, Equinor USA Onshore Properties, Inc. and Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Revenues derived from Epsilon’s production which have been eliminated from gathering system revenues amounted to $1.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Auburn GGS delivered 63.2 Bcf and 69.5 Bcf respectively, of natural gas, or 173 and 190 MMcf per day.
Proved Reserves
Per our reserve report prepared by independent petroleum consultants, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, are summarized in the table below. See Risk Factors for information relating to the uncertainties surrounding these reserve categories.

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
-------------------------------------------+---+-------------+---+--------------
​ | ​ | Natural Gas | ​ | Oil and Other

Total proved reserves at December 31, 2021 | | 110,968.8 | | 1,124.8 

​
We have not engaged in any exploration capital spending in 2021 or 2020. Our development capital spending to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for the periods indicated is as follows:

● | In 2021 in Pennsylvania, 3 gross (0.42 net) wells were drilled and 3 gross (0.27 net) completed. (Net development capital $4.1 million). Reserves of 4.6 Bcf for the 3 wells were reclassified as proved developed producing as these well were turned online at various times beginning in January and going through October of 2021. Additionally, 1 gross (0.18 net) well was drilled in 2021, but not completed (development capital $0.2 million). It is scheduled to be completed in April 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2021 in Oklahoma, we drilled 4 gross (0.75 net) wells and completed 2 gross (0.6 net) wells. Reserves of 2.8 Bcfe were reclassified as proved developed producing. Two gross (0.55 net) wells are scheduled to be completed in April.2022.

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process and Qualifications of Technical Persons with Oversight for The Company’s Overall Reserve Estimation Process
Our policies regarding internal controls over reserve estimates require reserves to be prepared by an independent engineering firm under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, and to be in compliance with generally accepted geologic, petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The corporate staff interacts with our internal petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals in each of our operating areas and with operating, accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for the reserves estimation process.

​




​
​

We provide our engineering firm with property interests, production, capital budgets, current operating costs, current production prices and other information. This information is reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to submission to our independent engineering firm. Reserves are reviewed and approved internally by our Chief Executive Officer on a semi-annual basis. Our Chief Executive Officer holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering has studied Petroleum Engineering courses on a Masters Level and completed a Masters in Business Administration. He has over 37 years of experience in various positions in the global natural gas and oil business, primarily holding positions in the areas of reservoir development strategy, property valuations, completions and production optimization. He has also been managing the allocation of capital in natural gas and oil investments and appraising the values of those assets on a quarterly basis with Domain Energy Advisors since January 2005. The reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent engineering firm. The person responsible for preparing the reserve report, Gregory Graves, is a Registered Professional Engineer (No.70734) in the State of Texas and a Senior Vice President of the firm. Mr. Graves graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Petroleum Engineering, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, and has prepared estimates of natural gas and oil reserves since joining DeGolyer and MacNaughton in 2006. 
Marketing and Major Customers
Natural gas marketing is extremely competitive in northeast Pennsylvania because of the limited interstate transportation capacity and ample natural gas supply. We do not currently own any firm transportation on interstate pipelines that would enable us to diversify our natural gas sales to downstream customers. As a result, all of our Pennsylvania gas sales occur in Zone 4 of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline at the Shoemaker Dehy meter, which is the receipt point from the Auburn Compression Facility.
Epsilon uses a third-party service, ARM Energy Management LLC (“ARM”) for its natural gas marketing. In this capacity, ARM is responsible for carrying out marketing activities such as submission of nominations, receipt of payments, submission of invoices and negotiation of contracts.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold natural gas through ARM to 30 unique customers. Direct Energy Business Marketing, LLC and SWN Energy Services Company, LLC each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold natural gas to 29 unique customers. Alta Energy Marketing LLC, EQT Energy LLC, South Jersey Resources Group LLC, and Spotlight Energy LLC each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue.
Geographic Locations of Operations
Approximately 93% and 97% of our production during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively was derived from natural gas production and gathering system revenues in the state of Pennsylvania. Our asset in Pennsylvania has not yet reached the mature stage, but at some point we may need to acquire and develop other producing assets to maintain our current level or to grow. To this end, we have begun to acquire leases and to expand our holdings in Pennsylvania.
As a result of this geographic concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, weather events or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil or natural gas
Competition
In the Marcellus Basin, we operate in a competitive environment for acquiring leases, developing reserves and marketing production. In most instances, we are a substantially smaller organization than our competitors both in terms of our personnel as well as our financial capability. This size differential relative to our competitors could disadvantage us, particularly in regard to accessing capital markets, acquiring technical expertise, and attracting and retaining talented personnel.
It is not uncommon in the oil and natural gas industry to experience shortages of drilling and completion rigs, 

9
​




​
​

equipment, pipe, services and personnel, which can cause both delays in development drilling activities and significant cost increases. We are exposed to the risk of industry competition for drilling rigs, completion rigs and availability of related equipment and services, among other goods and services required in our business.
In our gas gathering activity in the Marcellus, the competition for customer shippers on our Auburn GGS is significant. Although the Auburn GGS has three dedicated shippers (of which we are one), there is non-dedicated acreage within the footprint of the gathering system. However, the Auburn GGS currently serves only one non-anchor shipper, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract other customers to the system.
Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

● | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes—Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

We have elected to take advantage of the exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies.
We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest of:

● | the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1 million) or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities under an effective Securities Act registration statement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which means the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates (or public float) exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter in our prior fiscal year.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had nine full-time employees (including executive officers) in Houston, Texas. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a union.
The foundation of our Company is our employees and our success begins with a values-driven culture and 

10
​




​
​

commitment to developing a skilled, agile, diverse and engaged workforce where every employee understands that they can and do make a difference. Advancing a safe, ethical, inclusive and diverse culture creates an environment that attracts and retains the high-performing workforce needed to successfully execute our strategy.
To build a better tomorrow for everyone, we continue to foster a culture that embraces inclusion and diversity and encourages collaboration. Our core values include inclusion and diversity, and we believe in equity and the value and voice of every employee.
Legal Proceedings
On March 10, 2021, Epsilon filed a complaint against Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC (“Chesapeake”) in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Scranton, Pennsylvania. Epsilon claims that Chesapeake has breached a settlement agreement and several operating agreements (“JOAs”) to which Epsilon and Chesapeake are parties. Epsilon asserts that Chesapeake has failed to cooperate with Epsilon’s efforts to develop resources in the Auburn Development, located in North-Central Pennsylvania, as required under both the settlement agreement and JOAs. 
Epsilon requested a preliminary injunction but was unsuccessful in obtaining that injunction.  Epsilon filed a motion to amend its original Complaint. Chesapeake opposed. The Court ruled in Epsilon’s favor and allowed Epsilon’s amendment. Chesapeake moved to dismiss the amended Complaint. The Court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice to Epsilon’s right to file a new lawsuit based on new proposals made after the Court’s decision. Epsilon filed a motion for reconsideration of that decision. The motion for reconsideration was fully briefed in November 2021. Epsilon filed a notice of additional evidence to the motion for reconsideration on January 4, 2022. The motion for reconsideration was denied on January 18, 2022.
Epsilon filed a notice of appeal on February 15, 2022 challenging both the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration decisions. Chesapeake filed a cross-appeal on March 1, 2022. A briefing schedule has not yet been set but a decision on the appeal is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Regulation
Environmental Regulation
Epsilon is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the handling, management, disposal and discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or that may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may:

● | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases Epsilon’s overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on Epsilon’s operations, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, it is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that Epsilon will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations. However, given that such laws and 

11
​




​
​

regulations are subject to change, Epsilon is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on Epsilon’s operations, financial condition and results of operations.
Climate Change
There is consensus in the international scientific community that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) in the atmosphere will produce changes to global, as well as local, climate. Scientists project that increased concentrations of GHGs will cause more frequent, and more powerful storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations, as well as operations of our third party providers and customers, could be adversely affected. To date, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address potential impacts of climate change on our operations and there can be no assurance that any such impacts would not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Attempts to address GHGs, as well as climate change more generally, have taken the form of local, state, national and international proposals. Broadly speaking, examples include cap-and-trade programs, carbon tax proposals, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHGs from certain sources.
In the United States, federal proposals are rooted in the EPA’s “endangerment finding,” that was upheld by the Supreme Court. Simply, EPA has concluded that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment. For example, EPA adopted regulations that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction under Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that constitute major sources of emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards. 
Rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from designated sources in the United States on an annual basis, including, oil and natural gas production facilities and processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations, have been adopted. The EPA has expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities.
Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane from natural gas operations. In 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”), known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain facilities to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. EPA published amendments to those regulations effective September 15, 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing EPA to consider suspending, revising or rescinding the September 15, 2020 amendments and also to consider proposing new regulations governing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and gas sector operations. 
In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaking from oil and natural gas operations on public lands. A federal district court vacated much of that rule in October 2020 and that decision is now subject to an appeal. 
Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a non-binding agreement in France for nations to limit their GHG emissions through country-determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 (the “Paris Agreement”). Although the Trump Administration subsequently announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, on January 20, 2021 President Biden issued an Executive Order providing that he was accepting the Paris Agreement on behalf of the United States. 
In addition, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities.
Epsilon is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future, laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions. Any limits on GHG emissions, however, could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our gas gathering services. We are currently unable to calculate or predict the direct and indirect costs of GHG or climate change related laws, regulations and treaties, and accordingly, we cannot assure you that any such 

12

​

efforts will not have a material impact on our operations, financial condition and results.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has finalized a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. In 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 requesting comments related to disclosure for hydraulic fracturing chemicals. The Department of the Interior had released final regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American oil and natural gas leases which require lessees to file for approval of well stimulation work before commencement of operations and require well operators to disclose the trade names and purposes of additives used in the fracturing fluids. However, in December 2017, the Bureau of Land Management published a final rule rescinding the March 26, 2015 rule (“BLM 2015 Rule”), entitled “Natural gas and oil; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands.” The primary purposes of the BLM 2015 Rule were to ensure that wells were constructed so as to protect water supplies, to ensure environmentally responsible management of fluids displaced by fracturing, and to provide public disclosure of chemicals used in fracturing operations. The net effect of the December 2017 rule making is to return the affected sections of the Code of Federal Regulations to the language that existed before the BLM’s 2015 Rule. In addition, legislation has from time to time been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for additional federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require additional disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.
Epsilon is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the United States, but there can be no assurance that the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) would not materially and adversely affect Epsilon’s operations, financial condition and results of operations.
Gathering System Regulation
Regulation of gathering facilities may affect certain aspects of Epsilon’s business and the market for Epsilon’s services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC. The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas produced by Epsilon, as well as the revenues received for sales of Epsilon’s natural gas.
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act, or the NGA, and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations.
