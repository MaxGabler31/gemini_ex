Our Company
 
We are a leading global designer, producer and marketer of a wide range of electromechanical power transmission motion control (“PTMC”) products. Our technologies are used in various motion related applications and across a wide variety of high-volume manufacturing and non-manufacturing processes in which reliability and precision are critical to avoid costly down time and enhance the overall efficiency of operations.
 
We market our products under well recognized and established brands, which have been in existence for an average of over 85 years.  We serve a diversified group of customers comprised of over 1,000 direct original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) including GE, Honeywell and Siemens, and also benefit from established, long-term relationships with leading industrial distributors, including Applied Industrial Technologies, Grainger, Kaman Corporation and Motion Industries. Many of our customers operate globally across a large number of industries, ranging from transportation, turf and agriculture, energy and mining to factory automation, medical and robotics. Our relationships with these customers often span multiple decades, which we believe reflects the high level of performance, quality and service we deliver, supplemented by the breadth of our offering, vast geographic footprint and our ability to rapidly develop custom solutions for complex customer requirements.
 Our product lines involve a large number of unique parts, are generally delivered in small order quantities with short lead times and require varying levels of technical support and responsive customer service. Many of our OEM customers incorporate our products into their designs of their equipment, helping to generate high switching costs and foster brand preference. As a result of these characteristics, the essential nature of our products and the wear to which many are subjected, we generate a significant amount of recurring revenue with repeat customers. Our large installed base generates significant aftermarket replacement demand, which we estimate accounted for approximately 32% of revenues in 2018 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction.
 We seek to offer products and services guided by what we call the Voice of the Customer (“VOC”). We employ an integrated sales and marketing strategy that is focused on both key industries and individual product lines. We believe this dual “vertical” market and “horizontal” product-oriented approach distinguishes us in the marketplace by allowing us to quickly identify trends and customer growth opportunities and deploy resources accordingly.
 We believe our geographic footprint and portfolio of strong brands provides a platform from which to extend our leading market positions. Our expansive global footprint comprised of 52 manufacturing facilities, 20 service sales/engineering centers and approximately 9,300 employees enables us to serve global customers on a local basis.  In 2018, approximately 49% of our revenues on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction were generated from customers in North America, 32% were generated in Europe and 17% in Asia Pacific and the rest of the world. The diversification of our revenues on a geographical, end-market, business mix and customer basis are outlined below for the 2018 fiscal year.

 History and Acquisitions
 Formation of Altra
 Although Altra was incorporated in Delaware in 2004, much of our current business has its roots with the prior acquisition by Colfax Corporation, or Colfax, of the MPT (mechanical power transmission) group of Zurn Technologies, Inc. in December 1996. Colfax subsequently acquired Industrial Clutch Corp. in May 1997, Nuttall Gear Corp. in July 1997 and the Boston Gear and Delroyd Worm Gear brands in August 1997 as part of Colfax’s acquisition of Imo Industries, Inc. In February 2000, Colfax acquired Warner Electric, Inc., which sold products under the Warner Electric, Formsprag Clutch, Stieber, and Wichita Clutch brands. Colfax formed Power Transmission Holding, LLC or “PTH” in June 2004 to serve as a holding company for all of these power transmission businesses. Boston Gear was established in 1877, Warner Electric, Inc. in 1927, and Wichita Clutch in 1949.
 3


On November 30, 2004, we acquired our original core business through the acquisition of PTH from Colfax. We refer to this transaction as the PTH Acquisition.
 On October 22, 2004, The Kilian Company, or Kilian, a company formed at the direction of Genstar Capital, then the largest stockholder of Altra, acquired Kilian Manufacturing Corporation from Timken U.S. Corporation. At the completion of the PTH Acquisition, (i) all of the outstanding shares of Kilian capital stock were exchanged for shares of our capital stock and (ii) Kilian and its subsidiaries were transferred to our former wholly owned subsidiary Altra Power Transmission, Inc.
 Recent Acquisitions and Transactions
 On November 22, 2013, we changed our legal corporate name from Altra Holdings, Inc. to Altra Industrial Motion Corp.
 On December 17, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Svendborg Brakes A/S and S.B. Patent Holding ApS (together “Svendborg”). Svendborg is a leading global manufacturer of premium quality caliper brakes.
 On July 1, 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Guardian Ind., Inc., now known as Guardian Couplings LLC or Guardian Couplings. Guardian Couplings is a manufacturer and supplier of flywheel, motion control and general industrial couplings.
 On December 31, 2014, Altra Power Transmission, Inc., our former wholly owned subsidiary, was merged into Altra Industrial Motion Corp. 
 On December 30, 2016, we acquired the shares and certain assets and liabilities of the Stromag business from GKN plc. Stromag is a leading global manufacturer of highly engineered clutches and brakes, couplings, and limit switches for use in a variety of end markets including energy, metals and material handling. We refer to this transaction as the Stromag Acquisition.
 
On October 1, 2018 (the “A&S Closing Date”), Altra and Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”) consummated the combination of Altra with four operating companies from Fortive’s Automation & Specialty platform (excluding Fortive’s Hengstler and Dynapar businesses) (the “A&S Business”).  The A&S Business, consisting of four key brands, Kollmorgen, Portescap, Thomson and Jacobs Vehicle Systems, designs, manufactures, markets and sells electromechanical and electronic motion control products, including standard and custom motors, drives and controls; linear motion systems, ball screws, linear bearings, clutches/brakes, linear actuators and mechanical components; and through Jacobs Vehicle Systems, supplemental braking systems for commercial vehicles.  
 
In accordance with the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated March 7, 2018, among Altra, Fortive, McHale Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”) and Stevens Holding Company, Inc. (“Stevens Holding”), and a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated March 7, 2018, among Altra, Fortive and Stevens Holding (the “Distribution Agreement”), (1) Fortive transferred certain assets, liabilities and entities constituting a portion of the A&S Business to Stevens Holding, (2) Fortive distributed to its stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of Stevens Holding common stock held by Fortive by way of an exchange offer (the “Distribution”) and (3) Merger Sub merged with and into Stevens Holding and Stevens Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altra, and the issued and outstanding shares of Stevens Holding common stock converted into shares of Altra common stock (the “Merger”). In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, prior to the effective time of the Merger, Fortive transferred certain non-U.S. assets, liabilities and entities constituting the remaining portion of the A&S Business to certain subsidiaries of Altra, and the Altra subsidiaries assumed substantially all of the liabilities associated with the transferred assets (the “Direct Sales”) (all of the foregoing, collectively, the “Fortive Transaction”).  Upon consummation of the Fortive Transaction, the shares of Stevens Holding common stock then outstanding were automatically converted into the right to receive 35.0 million shares of Altra common stock, which were issued by Altra on the Closing Date, and represented approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares. Altra’s pre-Merger shareholders continued to hold the remaining approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock. 
 
The aggregate purchase price for the A&S Business of approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, consisted of $1,400 million of cash and debt instruments transferred to Fortive and shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. The value of the common stock was based on the closing stock price on the last trade date prior to the A&S Closing Date of $41.59. The initial accounting for the Fortive Transaction (including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities) is not complete. The Fortive Transaction was consummated on October 1, 2018 and, accordingly, the results of operations of the A&S Business are included in our operating results from October 1, 2018 onward.
 4


In connection with the Fortive Transaction, certain additional agreements were entered into, including, among others, an Employee Matters Agreement, dated March 7, 2018, among Altra, Fortive and Stevens Holding (the “Employee Matters Agreement”), a Tax Matters Agreement (the “Tax Matters Agreement”), a Transition Services Agreement (the “Transition Services Agreement”), in each case, dated October 1, 2018, among Altra, Fortive, and Stevens Holding, and an Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement, dated October 1, 2018, between Altra and Fortive.  In addition, effective October 1, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Altra common stock from 90.0 million shares to 120.0 million shares. 
 
Our Industry
 
Based on industry data provided by the Power Transmission Distributors Association in collaboration with MDM Analytics and Channel Marketing Group, we estimate that global industrial power transmission motion control products generated revenues of approximately $200 billion in 2018.  These products are collectively used to generate, transmit, control and transform mechanical energy.  Altra participates in portions of the motor, control, linear, gearing, clutch, brake, coupling, belted drive, and non-industrial bearing segments. 
 The global power transmission motion control industry in which we compete is highly fragmented, with over 1,000 small manufacturers and relatively few players of scale. While smaller companies tend to focus on regional niche markets with narrow product lines, larger players that generate annual revenue of over $100 million generally offer a broader range of products and provide global sales and service capabilities.
 Buyers of power transmission motion control products tend to be broadly diversified and are often either OEMs, end users, or systems integrators operating across many end markets, including manufacturing, factory automation, aerospace and defense, food and beverage, metals and mining, energy, medical, robotics and other markets. These customers typically place a premium on factors such as quality and reliability, performance, pricing, distribution channel access, technology and innovation, application engineering and customer support, breadth of offering and brand name recognition. We believe the most successful industry participants are those that leverage their engineering expertise and specific industry knowledge, reputation for quality and reliability and technical support capabilities to maintain attractive margins and gain market share.
 The global power transmission motion control market is driven by general macro-economic growth and secular trends such as the increasing concern for industrial safety and rising demand for motion control in the medical, food and beverage, electrical, automotive and machinery industries. The rapid pace of globalization and developments in the automation sector have also supported growth. Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing region for motion control products due to increasing demand for automation in manufacturing facilities and rapid industrial expansion in countries like China and India. Motion control products tend to be higher-margin than power transmission products due to a greater use of technology and leverage in end markets with more attractive secular trends.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Establish and Capitalize on the Altra Business System to Drive Margin Expansion and Organic Growth. We believe we can continue to improve profitability through cost control, overhead rationalization, global process optimization, expanded implementation of lean manufacturing techniques and strategic pricing initiatives. Our operating plan, executed through our manufacturing centers of excellence, provides additional opportunities to consolidate purchasing processes and reduce costs by sharing best practices across geographies and business lines. We are in the process of establishing a new optimized Altra Business System (ABS) by merging and applying Fortive’s signature Fortive Business System (FBS) and the Altra Operational Excellence program across our combined business to generate cost savings and efficiency opportunities. The ABS will incorporate a management philosophy with integrated practices that focus on employing best-in-class tools, knowledge and expertise to drive continuous improvement in lean manufacturing, leadership and growth objectives, further enhancing our ability to achieve our aggressive strategic objectives. We are applying the concepts of both the FBS and Altra Operational Excellence programs to all areas of our combined business, including how we grow, how we create new products and how we develop new people to ultimately drive strong results.
Collaborate with Customers to Create New Opportunities. We focus on developing new products across our business in direct response to customer requirements. Our extensive application-engineering know-how drives both new and repeat revenue opportunities, supported by a substantiated history of innovation, with over 800 patents granted and pending worldwide. We intend to continue to drive organic growth by investing in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to attain and sustain competitive leadership in the industries we serve. For example, we intend to capitalize on the emerging trend of combining mechanical components, electrical components, software and communications capabilities into “smart products” to address customer needs related to “Industry 4.0” and the “Internet of Things”.

Leverage Global Business Presence and Shared Services. We seek to foster the sharing of best practices throughout our organization, challenging our business leaders to work together to identify new markets, potential cross-selling opportunities and increase penetration with existing customers. The Acquisition of the Fortive A&S Business enhanced our ability to reach customers globally, which we expect will help facilitate our entry into new markets, harness existing sales channels and build familiarity with customer needs. By leveraging our global presence, our businesses can work together to identify cost-saving opportunities and improve our overall supply chain management. We believe that our business will ultimately receive the benefits of expanded customer service operations, cohesive marketing efforts and consolidated corporate support functions, increasing efficiency and reducing costs.
Focus on Key Niche End Markets to Increase Organic Growth. We emphasize strategic marketing to focus on new growth opportunities in key end-user and OEM markets. Through a systematic process that leverages our core brands and products, we seek to identify attractive markets and product niches, collect customer and industry data, identify market drivers, tailor product and service solutions to specific customer requirements and deploy resources to gain market share and drive future revenue growth.
Attract and Retain Talented Associates. We believe that our team of talented employees, united by a common culture in pursuit of continuous improvement, provides a significant competitive advantage. We will seek to continue to attract, develop and retain world-class leaders and associates globally and to drive their engagement with our customer-centric approach.
Realize Synergies by Leveraging Core Competencies. Through the Fortive Transaction, we estimate there to be up to approximately $52 million in run rate synergies able to be realized over the next four years. We expect to realize approximately $23 million of these synergies within two years of closing the Fortive Transaction, and that in order to achieve these synergies, we expect to incur approximately $24 million of non-recurring costs during the first three years following the consummation of the Fortive Transaction.  We believe that our supply chain expertise, value engineering capabilities, facility consolidation experience and internalization of the Fortive Business System will help us optimize our business processes and realize these synergies.
Our Strengths
 
Superior financial profile with high margins and strong cash flow generation. We have an attractive financial profile highlighted by our diversified revenue stream across products and end markets, high margin profile and substantial cash flow. Our strong cash flow generation is attributable to attractive gross margins, a high degree of operational leverage across our selling, general and administrative expenses and minimal capital expenditures.   For example, as a result of the acquisition of the A&S Business, our revenues for the three-month period ending December 31, 2018 grew by 105% from $228.5 million to $469.2 million. 
 
Our flexible cost structure and diversified end market and geographic exposure have allowed us to perform well throughout economic cycles. From 2008 through 2010, our business was able to generate higher cash flow through the strict management of working capital, enabling us to reduce our indebtedness and maintain a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio within our targeted range of 2.0x to 3.0x. We believe that after the acquisition of the A&S Business, our business has the capability to support growth while also taking advantage of operating leverage and the benefits of our cost rationalization initiatives, all of which we believe will allow us to continue delivering sustainably strong cash flow. As a result, over time we intend to manage our leverage level to below 3.0x.
 
Scale and breadth combined with leading brands, technology and market position. We are a global player with significant scale, technological leadership and a broad product offering supported by leading brands, factors which we expect will contribute to a market share advantage over our competitors. The Acquisition of the A&S Business moved our business up the power transmission, motion control and automation technology spectrum, increasing our presence in highly engineered products. These engineered products, although higher margin and exposed to high growth applications, are simultaneously complementary to our portfolio. Our engineered servo, stepper and specialty miniature motors, drives and controls, and linear automation systems capabilities will enable us to drive innovation across our offering and expand solutions for existing customers. Similarly, the combination of the JVS suite of engine braking products with our already strong clutch brake offering expands our addressable market and provides our customers with a unique portfolio of braking solutions.
 
Broad geographic footprint and global reach. The capabilities and scale of our Company, especially after the acquisition of the A&S Business, provide a broader, more global platform from which to drive growth. We are able to leverage our expansive global footprint comprised of 52 manufacturing facilities, 20 service sales/engineering centers and approximately 9,300 employees worldwide to serve our global customers with local resources. While we expect to build on our leading market positions and strong brands in North America, our broadened global platform also positions us to capitalize on key growth opportunities in Europe and especially in emerging markets.

Diversified end-markets provide stability. With no end market comprising more than approximately 16% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction, our end-market exposure is diversified, which we expect will provide stability to our revenue streams and help to mitigate potential volatility in any particular industry. We believe that the acquisition of the A&S Business significantly expands our total addressable market, particularly in higher growth, higher margin end-markets like medical, advanced material handling, factory automation, food and beverage and robotics. The exposure to these attractive new end markets helps to diversify our relative potential exposure to more cyclical end markets like mining, renewable energy and oil & gas.
 
Our business is also geographically diversified, with approximately 49% of pro forma revenue giving effect to the Fortive Transaction generated outside of North America in the year ended December 31, 2018. Finally, our products often facilitate movement which subjects them to wear and requires their periodic replacement. Our large installed base of products generates significant aftermarket replacement demand, which we estimate accounted for approximately 32% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction. Given the critical nature of many of our products and often high switching costs for our customers, we believe that this base of recurring revenue is stable.
 
Customer diversification with long-standing customer and distributor relationships. We have a strong, diversified customer base of over 1,000 OEMs and leading electro mechanical power transmission motion control distributors which market our products via a diversified network of over 3,000 outlets globally.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there was no meaningful customer concentration among either our OEMs or distributor customers, the largest of which accounts for less than 5% of total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction. Some of our largest OEM customers include Cummins, Daimler AG, General Electric, John Deere, Komatsu, and Siemens, all of whom we have had relationships with for decades. We believe that these deep relationships exhibit our commitment to high levels of product quality and service, resulting in customer satisfaction and ultimately, retention.
 
Our scale, expansive product offering and end-user preference for our products make our product portfolio attractive to both large, multi-branch distributors and regional, independent distributors. We often participate in lengthy design and qualification processes with key customers for crucial components which ultimately become “spec’d-in” to our customers’ own designs. Further, many of our products involve a large number of unique parts, are delivered in small order quantities with short lead times and require varying levels of technical support, all of which help to drive high switching costs and generate significant recurring opportunities with repeat customers.
 
Aftermarket sales supported by large installed base. On average, our brands have been in operation for over 85 years and we believe we benefit from one of the largest installed customer bases in the industry. The moving, wearing nature of our products necessitates regular replacement and our large installed base of products generates significant aftermarket replacement demand. This has created a recurring revenue stream from a diversified group of end-user customers. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately 32% of our revenues on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction were derived from aftermarket sales.
 
Experienced management team. We are led by a senior management team with significant industry, manufacturing and acquisition integration experience which has implemented various initiatives that have contributed and will continue to contribute, to our operational and financial performance. The management team combines talent from both Altra and the A&S Business, with significant experience in power transmission, motion control and automation. The combined management team has a clearly defined, executable plan to integrate and rationalize operations to realize the benefits of the Fortive Transaction, while leveraging the experience from the three integrations Altra has successfully completed in the last five years, including the integration of new product offerings to the portfolio and driving operational improvements.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 Our continued investment in new product development is intended to help drive customer growth as we address key customer needs.
 
Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products in over 70 countries to over 1,000 direct OEM customers and over 3,000 distributor outlets. We offer our products through our direct sales force comprised of approximately 350 company-employed sales engineers as well as a relatively small number of independent sales representatives. Our worldwide sales and distribution presence enables us to provide timely and responsive technical support and service to our customers, many of which operate globally, and to capitalize on growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets around the world.
 Our operating companies employ an integrated sales and marketing strategy concentrated on specific battlegrounds – the intersection of key industries, product lines and geographic regions where we believe we can offer differentiated solutions to our customers. We believe this focus on battlegrounds distinguishes us in the marketplace allowing us to quickly identify trends and customer growth opportunities and deploy resources accordingly. Within our battlegrounds, we market to OEMs, encouraging them to incorporate our products into their equipment designs, to distributors and to end-users, helping to foster brand preference. With this strategy, we are able to leverage our market experience, product technology and global reach to sell power transmission, motion control and automation solutions for a host of focused applications.
 Distribution
 Our products are either incorporated into end products sold by OEMs or sold through industrial distributors as aftermarket products to end users and smaller OEMs. We operate a geographically diversified business. For the year ended December 31, 2018 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction, we derived approximately 51% of our net sales from customers in North America, 32% from customers in Europe and 17% from customers in Asia and the rest of the world. Our global customer base is served by an extensive global sales network comprised of our sales engineers as well as our network of over 3,000 distributor outlets.
 Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, our industrial and high-tech distributors can be active participants in influencing product purchasing decisions. In addition, distributors play a critical role through stocking inventory of our products, which amplifies the accessibility of our products to aftermarket buyers. It is for this reason that distributor partner relationships are an important component of our route-to-market strategy. We enjoy strong established relationships with the leading distributors as well as a broad, diversified base of specialty and regional distributors.

Competition
 
While we believe that many of our businesses are leaders in many of our served markets, we operate in highly fragmented and very competitive industries within the power transmission motion control market. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate, such as helical gear drives or standard servo motors, and some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources. In addition, with respect to certain of our products, we compete with divisions of our OEM customers. Competition in our business lines is based on a number of considerations including quality, reliability, performance, pricing, delivery speed, technology and innovation, design and application engineering support and brand name recognition. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, regular investment in manufacturing, customer service and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection is required. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive. In addition, some of our larger, more sophisticated customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. There is substantial and continuing pressure on major OEMs and larger distributors to reduce costs, including the cost of products purchased from outside suppliers such as us. As a result of cost pressures from our customers, our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to generate production cost savings and, in turn, find reliable, cost-effective outside component suppliers or manufacturers for our products. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We operate in the highly competitive mechanical power transmission motion control industry and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be significantly harmed.”
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, license arrangements, and domain name registrations to protect our intellectual property. We sell our products under a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in the PTMC industry. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not believe any single patent, trademark or trade name is material to our business as a whole with the exception of certain trademarks associated with our Bauer, Boston Gear, Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Kollmorgen, Portescap, Stromag, Svendborg, TB Wood’s, Thomson and Warner Electric brands. Any issued patents that cover our proprietary technology and any of our other intellectual property rights may not provide us with adequate protection or be commercially beneficial to us and, patents applied for, may not be issued. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. If we are unable to protect our patented technologies, our competitors could commercialize technologies or products which are substantially similar to ours.
 
With respect to proprietary know-how, we rely on trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and on confidentiality agreements. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position.
 
Some of our registered and unregistered trademarks include: Warner Electric, Boston Gear, TB Wood’s, Kilian, Nuttall Gear, Ameridrives, Wichita Clutch, Formsprag, Bibby Transmissions, Stieber, Matrix, Inertia Dynamics, Twiflex, Industrial Clutch, Huco Dynatork, Marland, Delroyd, Warner Linear, Bauer Gear Motor, PowerFlex, Svendborg Brakes, Guardian Couplings, Kollmorgen, Thomson, Portescap, Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Jake Brake, Deltran, Delevan and Stromag. From time to time, Altra engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights.

As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 9,300 people on a full-time basis, of whom approximately 3,700 were employed in the United States and approximately 5,600 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 665 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. The Company believes that its relationship with employees is good. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities, or our customers may be subjected to work stoppages, which could seriously impact our operations and the profitability of our business.”
Suppliers and Raw Materials
 We obtain raw materials, component parts and supplies from a variety of sources, generally from more than one supplier. Our suppliers and sources of raw materials are based in both the United States and other countries and we believe that our sources of raw materials are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not believe the loss of any one supplier would have a material

adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including aluminum, copper, electronic components, plastics, rare-earth magnets, and steel. We generally purchase our materials on the open market, where certain commodities such as steel and copper have fluctuated in price significantly in recent years. We have not experienced any significant shortage of our key materials and have not historically engaged in hedging transactions for commodity suppliers.
 
Our ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at facilities, excessive demand, raw material shortages, or other reasons, could impair our ability, and that of our suppliers, to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.
 
Seasonality
 
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. In addition, we experience seasonality in our turf and garden business. As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality is also affected by weather and the level of housing starts. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.
Regulatory Matters
 
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products. The following sections describe certain significant regulations to which our businesses are subject. There may be additional regulations that apply to our businesses.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management, and workplace health and safety. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.”
 
Export/Import Compliance
 
We are required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, including:
 
 
• | the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, impose license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (which are items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export or reexport of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other nations’ governments have implemented similar export and import control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Industry – Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.”
 

Working Capital 
 
We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support the needs of our businesses. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items. In addition, we believe our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.
Backlog
 
Our unfilled product orders were approximately $485 million and $215 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders as of December 31, 2018 will have been delivered to customers within three to four months of such date. Given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of the our products and the shortening of product life cycles, we believe that backlog is indicative of short-term revenue performance, but is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium-term or long-term revenue performance.
Government Contracts
 
Although the substantial majority of our revenues in 2018 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction were from customers other than governmental entities, we do have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and government-owned entities.
International Operations
 
Altra’s products are available worldwide, and our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia. We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provide greater stability to our operations, drive economies of scale, provide revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offer an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target high growth markets.
 Annual revenue derived from customers outside the United States (based on geographic destination) as a percentage of total annual revenue on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction was 49% in 2018 and 48% in 2017.
 The manner in which our products are sold outside the United States differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by its subsidiaries located outside the United States, though we also sell directly from the United States into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors.
