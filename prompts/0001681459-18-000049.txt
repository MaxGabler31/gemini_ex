HISTORY
In March 2015, FMC Technologies, Inc., a U.S. Delaware corporation (“FMC Technologies”), and Technip S.A., a French société anonyme (“Technip”), signed an agreement to form an exclusive alliance and to launch Forsys Subsea, a 50/50 joint venture, that would unite the skills and capabilities of two subsea industry leaders. This alliance, which became operational on June 1, 2015 was established to identify new and innovative approaches to the design, delivery, and maintenance of subsea fields.
Forsys Subsea brought the industry's most talented subsea professionals together early in operators’ project concept phase with the technical capabilities to design integrate products, systems and installation to significantly reduce the cost of subsea field development and enhance overall project economics.
Based on the success of the Forsys joint venture and its innovative approach to integrate solutions, Technip and FMC Technologies announced in May 2016 that the companies would combine through a merger of equals to create a global leader, TechnipFMC, that would drive change by redefining the production and transformation of oil and gas. The business combination was completed on January 16, 2017 (the “Merger”), and on January 17, 2017, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified, combined company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange (“Euronext Paris”) under the symbol “FTI.”
In 2017, our first year as a merged company, TechnipFMC secured several project awards as many operators moved forward with final investment decisions for major onshore projects and subsea developments. Several of the subsea awards incorporated the use of our an integrated approach to project delivery, validating our unique business model aimed at lowering project costs and accelerating the delivery of initial hydrocarbon production. This approach was made possible by bringing together the complimentary work scopes of the merged companies. With the industry’s most comprehensive and only truly integrated market offering, we have continued to expand the deepwater opportunity set for our customers. TechnipFMC’s expertise does not end with the production of hydrocarbons. Because of its best in class project design and execution capabilities, enabled by a portfolio of proprietary technologies, TechnipFMC continues to secure and deliver projects that further enable our clients to monetize resources - from liquefaction of gas onshore or on floating vessels, through refining and product facilities.

The Company continued to innovate and introduce new technologies across our portfolio of products and services. TechnipFMC also delivered strong financial performance in 2017, driven by a relentless focus on operational execution and cost reduction activities.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Subsea
The Subsea segment provides integrated design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, fabrication and installation and life of field services for subsea systems, subsea field infrastructure and subsea pipe systems used in oil and gas production and transportation.
We have manufacturing facilities located near the world’s principal offshore oil and gas producing basins. We operate flexible pipe manufacturing plants, umbilical production units, reeled rigid pipe shore-based facilities, plus a fleet of specialized vessels for pipeline installation, subsea construction, diving support and heavy lift. 
We have created an industry leader in front end engineering and design (“FEED”), subsea production systems (“SPS”), flexible pipe, and subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines (“SURF”). Our strong commercial focus has enabled the successful market introduction of an integrated Subsea business model, which spans a project’s early phase design through the life-of-field. Our integrated business model is unlocking incremental opportunities and materially expanding the deepwater opportunity set. 
Through integrated FEED studies, iFEEDTM (“iFEED”), we are uniquely positioned to influence project concept and design. Using innovative solutions for field architecture, including standardized equipment, new technologies, and simplified installation, we can significantly reduce subsea development costs and accelerate time to first production.
Further, we are driving even greater value through our ability to integrate the SPS and SURF scopes and more efficiently execute the installation campaign, known as integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and installation, iEPCI™ (“iEPCI”). Our first-mover advantage and ability to convert iFEED studies into iEPCI contracts, often as a direct award, also creates a unique proprietary set of opportunities for the Company that are not available to our peers. This allows us to deliver a fully integrated - and technologically differentiated - subsea system, and to better manage the complete work scope through a single contracting mechanism and single interface, where we can provide the greatest benefit to project economics.
Our Subsea business depends on our ability to maintain a cost-effective and efficient production system, achieve planned equipment production targets, successfully develop new products, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. 
Engineering, Manufacturing and Supply Chain (“EMS”) is a new organization we formed in November 2017 to help achieve productivity improvements by reducing the cost of engineering and manufacturing our products, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, and optimizing our processes and how we manage workflow. Through EMS, we are focused on implementing world-class manufacturing practices, including lean flow and automation, to improve delivery and reliability, while reducing total product cost and lead time to delivery. 
Principal Products and Services
Subsea Systems. Our systems are used in the offshore production of crude oil and natural gas. Subsea systems are placed on the seafloor and are used to control the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the reservoir to a host processing facility, such as a floating production facility, a fixed platform or an onshore facility.
Our subsea production systems and products include drilling systems, subsea trees, chokes and flow modules, manifold pipeline systems, control and data management systems, well access systems, multiphase and wetgas meters, and additional technologies.The design and manufacture of our subsea systems requires a high degree of technical expertise and innovation. Some of our systems are designed to withstand exposure to the extreme hydrostatic pressure of deepwater environments, as well as internal pressures of up to 20,000 pounds per square inch (“psi”) and temperatures up to 400º F. The development of our integrated subsea production systems includes initial engineering design studies and field development planning to consider all relevant aspects and project requirements, including optimization of drilling programs and subsea architecture. 
Our subsea processing systems, which include subsea boosting, subsea gas compression and subsea separation, are designed to accelerate production, increase recovery, extend field life, and/or lower operators’ production costs. To provide these products, systems and services, we utilize engineering, project management, procurement, manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities.

Flexible Pipe and Umbilical Supply. We perform the engineering and manufacturing of flexible pipes, relying on our engineering centers across various regions and our manufacturing units. In Brazil, the flexible pipes are delivered alongside the dock of the manufacturing unit and are loaded onto a vessel operated by the client. In other markets, TechnipFMC vessels typically install the flexible pipes.
We use engineering and technical expertise to respond to tenders from a variety of clients including oil companies, engineering, procurement, construction and installation services (“EPCI”) contractors and other subsea production system manufacturers, often as part of a broader scope. The Company relies upon engineering centers, and the thermoplastic, steel tube, hybrid (a combination of steel tube, thermoplastic hose and electrical cables) and power cable umbilical manufacturing units across various regions.
Vessels. We operate a fleet consisting of 18 vessels, with two additional vessels under construction. Of the 18 vessels currently in operation, we have sole ownership of nine vessels, ownership of six vessels within joint ventures, and operate three vessels under long-term charter. The fleet has been reduced significantly since 2013, when it consisted of 36 vessels, including nine under construction at the time.
We wholly own five pipelay support vessels and jointly owns eight subsea construction vessels, including two under construction. All of the jointly owned vessels have a 50/50 ownership structure and operate exclusively in the Brazilian market. These vessels are contracted to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (“Petrobras”), principally to install umbilical and flexible flowlines and risers to connect subsea wells to floating production units across a range of water depths. We also own one subsea construction and pipelay vessel mostly dedicated to the Asia Pacific market and have long-term charter agreements for three further construction vessels. The Company also owns three dive support vessels. 
Subsea Services. We provide an array of subsea services to improve uptime, lower lifecycle costs and increase recovery over the life of the field for our clients’ subsea production systems. These services include (i) provision of exploration and production well head systems, (ii) installation and completion, (iii) asset management services for test, maintenance, refurbishment and upgrades of subsea equipment and tooling, (iv) field performance services based on product data and field data to optimize the performance of the subsea production systems, (v) inspection, maintenance and repair (“IMR”) of subsea infrastructure. (vi) well access and intervention services, both rig-based and vessel-based (riserless light well intervention or “RLWI”), to enhance well production, (vii) Remotely Operated Vehicles (“ROV”) services, and (viii) well plug and abandonment and decommissioning.
Key drivers of subsea services market activity are the inspection and maintenance of subsea infrastructure, driven in large part by aging infrastructure on mature fields. The need for well intervention services also continues to grow, with more than 6,000 wells operated globally, of which 33% are older than 10 years and 65% are older than five years. 
With our extensive experience in subsea equipment, our large installed base of subsea production infrastructure, our broad range of services, and our historical technical leadership, we are in a unique position to offer integrated solutions through “life of field” services combining asset light solutions (e.g., RLWI), digital services (e.g., Condition Performance Monitoring / Flow Manager suite of applications), and leading edge automated systems (e.g., Schilling ROVs, IRIS) to enhance the economics of producing fields through maximization of asset uptime, higher production volumes and lower operating expense.
Robotics, Controls and Automation. We design and manufacture ROVs and manipulator arms that are used in subsea drilling, construction, IMR, and life of field services. Our product offering includes electric and hydraulic work-class ROVs, tether-management systems, launch and recovery systems, remote manipulator arms and modular control systems . We also provide support and services such as product training, pilot simulator training, spare parts, and technical assistance.
We also provide electro-hydraulic and electric production and intervention control systems, allowing accurate control and monitoring of subsea installations to ensure the highest production availability while providing safe and environmentally friendly field operations. These include the sensors, multi-phase flow meters, digital infrastructure, integrity monitoring, control functionality and automation features needed for subsea systems. Robotics capabilities are now being applied in the space of controlling manifold valves during production. This is a convergence of our technologies in order to provide a better systems for our customers.
Capital Intensity
Many of the systems and products we supply for subsea applications are highly engineered to meet the unique demands of our customers’ field properties and are typically ordered one to two years prior to installation. We often receive advance payments and progress billings from our customers to fund initial development and working capital requirements. However, Our working capital balances can vary significantly depending on the payment terms and execution timing on key contracts.
6

Dependence on Key Customers
Generally, our customers in this segment are major integrated oil companies, national oil companies and independent exploration and production companies.
We actively pursue alliances with companies that are engaged in the subsea development of oil and natural gas to promote our integrated systems for subsea production. These alliances are typically related to the procurement of subsea production equipment, although some alliances are related to EPCI services. Development of subsea fields, particularly in deepwater environments, involves substantial capital investments. Operators have also sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of subsea and other energy-related systems that provide integrated solutions to meet their needs.
Our alliances establish important ongoing relationships with our customers. While these alliances do not contractually commit our customers to purchase our systems and services, they have historically led to, and we expect that they would continue to result in, such purchases.
No single Subsea customer accounted for more than 10% or more of our 2017 consolidated revenue.
Competition
Our Subsea segment competes across: subsea products, subsea projects and subsea services. For subsea products, we typically compete with companies that supply subsea systems, pipes, umbilicals, and smaller companies that are focused on a specific application, technology or geographical niche in which TechnipFMC operates. Competitors include OneSubsea (a Schlumberger company) (“OneSubsea”), Baker Hughes, a GE Company (“Baker Hughes”), Aker Solutions ASA, Dril-Quip, Inc., National Oilwell Varco and Oceaneering International, Inc. For Subsea EPCI, competitors include Subsea 7 S.A., Saipem S.p.A. (“Saipem”) and McDermott International Inc. 
Seasonality
In the North Sea, winter weather generally subdues drilling activity, reducing vessel utilization and demand for subsea services as certain activities cannot be performed. As a result, the level of offshore activity in our Subsea segment is negatively impacted in the first quarter of each year.
Market Environment
The low crude oil price environment over the last three years led many of our customers to reduce their capital spending plans or defer new deepwater projects. The reduction and deferral of projects has resulted in delayed subsea projects inbound for the industry. Operators continue to take needed actions to improve their subsea project economics and suppliers in turn continue to take the necessary steps to further reduce project break-even levels by offering cost-effective approaches for project developments. The risk of project sanctioning delays continues to be high in the current environment; however, innovative approaches to subsea projects, like our iEPCI solution, have improved project economics and many offshore discoveries can be developed economically at today’s crude oil prices. In the long term, deepwater development is expected to remain a significant part of operators’ portfolios.
Strategy
Our strategy includes the following priorities:

• | early involvement in the conceptual design and integrated front-end engineering, or iFEED of subsea development projects to create value through technology and integration of scopes (integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and installation, or iEPCI ) by simplifying field architecture accelerating delivery schedules, and time to first production;


• | innovative research and development (“R&D”), often in collaboration with clients and partners, to develop leading products and technologies that deliver greater efficiency to the client, lower development costs, and enable frontier developments;


• | superior project execution capabilities allowing the Company to mobilize the right teams, assets and facilities to capture and profitably execute complex subsea projects and services;


• | capitalization on combined competencies coming from alliances and partnerships with both clients and suppliers; and

7


• | leverage of supplier relationships to capitalize on supply chain market dynamics and implement greater simplification and standardization in products and processes.

Recent and Future Developments
With many of our customers reducing their capital spending plans or deferring new deepwater projects in response to a low crude oil price environment, we have adjusted our workforce and manufacturing capacity to align our operations with the anticipated decreases in activity due to delayed project inbound. These restructuring actions have resulted in a leaner cost structure. The operational improvements and cost reductions made in 2016, combined with additional actions taken in 2017 will help mitigate the anticipated decline in operating margins in 2018.
In November 2017, we announced the launch of a completely new suite of products called Subsea 2.0. Relative to traditional subsea equipment, the Subsea 2.0 technology portfolio significantly reduces the size, weight, and part count of the equipment installed on the seabed. Subsea 2.0 technologies can enhance project economics both as a stand-alone offering and as part of an integrated solution, further unlocking oil and gas reserves that otherwise would not be developed. 
We believe that 2016 marked the inflection in subsea order activity as demonstrated by operators making final investment decisions on several major developments. The Company’s full year Subsea orders of $5.1 billion in 2017 increased 16 percent from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, we received a major iEPCI award for the VNG Norge Fenja project in Norway. Our integrated business model is positively impacting project economics and expanding the deepwater opportunity set.
In 2018, we expect to see another increase in subsea market activity, driven by major projects, as well as a blend of small-to-mid size projects and service opportunities. In addition, we identify the following longer-term trends in the subsea market: 

• | Smaller projects and direct awards represent a growing portion of our order mix. In 2017, these awards represented just over half of total inbound orders; the remainder being publicly announced projects as well as subsea service activities. Subsea tiebacks are often part of this mix; these shorter cycle brownfield expansions provide operators with faster paybacks and higher returns.


• | There is a growing trend towards independent operators and new entrants undertaking subsea developments; we are a natural partner for this customer group because of the ability to offer fully integrated solutions.


• | Natural gas developments are growing in prominence. We believe that more than half of offshore capital expenditures could be directed at natural gas developments by early next decade.

We continue to work closely with our customers and believe that, in the context of weaker oil prices, with our unique business model we can further reduce their project break-even levels by offering cost-effective approaches to their project developments. This includes growing customer acceptance of integrated business models to help achieve the cost-reduction goals and accelerate time to first oil and gas.
Product Development
We continue to expand our Subsea technologies portfolio of solutions to deliver a complete production system for high pressure and high temperature applications. In 2014, we entered into a joint development agreement with several major operators to develop common standards for subsea production equipment capable of operating at pressures as high as 20,000 psi and temperatures up to 350º F. This joint development agreement is delivering standardized design, materials, processes and interfaces to deliver improved reliability and operations over the life of the field. 
Technology development progressed on Subsea 2.0, the next generation of subsea equipment, utilizing designs that will be significantly smaller, lighter and simpler than current designs. These new products incorporate a modular product architecture and component level standardization to enable a flexible configure-to-order approach. The products are expected to deliver breakthrough in the way that subsea products are manufactured, assembled, installed and maintained over the life of the field. Several major elements of the portfolio were launched to the market during the year. We also completed the development of our second generation of electrically trace heated pipe in pipe (ETH-PiP), which delivers significant advancements in power output and length enabling hydrate prevention in longer distance tiebacks of 50 kilometers and beyond.
In addition to the investments made to develop lower cost production solutions, we also invest in the development of technology to expand our service portfolio. During the year, we qualified new technology to enable the inspection of flexible risers and flowlines. We are also advancing subsea robotic productivity through the development of more efficient ROV systems that are easier to operate and maintain.

When used with LNG, Cryomax® technology allows the efficient production of ethane and propane as components of mixed refrigerant processes, even when processing very lean gas. 
9

We specialize in the design and construction of large-scale gas treatment complexes as well as existing facility upgrades. Gas treatment includes the removal of carbon dioxide and sulfur components from natural gas using chemical or physical solvents, sulfur recovery, and gas sweetening processes based on the use of an amine solvent. The Company ranks among the top contractors in the field in relation to sulfur recovery units installed in refineries or natural gas processing plants. Given our long-term experience in the field of sour gas processing, we can provide support to clients for the overall evaluation of the gas sweetening/sulfur recovery chain and the selection of optimum technologies.
Ethylene. We hold proprietary technologies and are a leader in the design, construction and commissioning of ethylene production plants. We design steam crackers, from concept stage through construction and commissioning, for both new plants (including mega-crackers) and plant expansions. We have a portfolio of the latest generation of commercially proven technologies and are uniquely positioned to be both a licensor and an EPC contractor. Our technological developments have improved the energy efficiency in ethylene plants by improving thermal efficiency of the furnaces and reducing the compression power required per ton, reducing carbon dioxide emissions per ton of ethylene by 30%.

We provide a range of services that includes process technology licensing and development and full EPC complexes. We license a portfolio of chemical technologies through long-standing alliances and relationships with leading manufacturing companies and technology providers. We have research centers to develop and test technologies for polymer and petrochemical applications, where fully automated pilot plants gather design data to scale-up processes for commercialization. 
Hydrogen. Hydrogen is the most widely used industrial gas in the refining, chemical and petrochemical industries, and is also widely used in the production of cleaner transport fuels. We offer a single point of responsibility for the design and construction of hydrogen and synthesis gas production units, with solutions ranging from Process Design Packages to full lumpsum turnkey projects. We also offer services for maintenance and performance optimization of running units. We have solutions in place for carbon capture readiness in future hydrogen plants, targeting more than a two-thirds reduction in carbon dioxide release from the hydrogen plant.
Fixed Platforms. We offer a broad range of fixed platform solutions in shallow water, including: large conventional platforms with pile steel jackets whose topsides are installed offshore either by heavy life vessel or floatover; small, conventional platforms installed by small crane vessel; steel gravity-based structure platforms, generally with floatover topsides; and small to large self-installing platforms.
Floating Production Units. We offer a broad range of floating platform solutions for moderate to ultra-deepwater applications, including:

• | Spar platforms: capable of operating in a wide range of water depths, the Spar is a low motion floater that can support full drilling with dry trees or with tender assist and flexible or steel catenary risers. The Spar topside is installed offshore either by heavy lift or floatover;


• | Semi-Submersible Platforms: these platforms are well suited to oil field developments where subsea wells drilled by the mobile offshore drilling unit are appropriate. Semi-Submersibles can operate in a wide range of water depths and have full drilling and large topside capability. We have our own unique design of low-motion Semi-Submersible platforms that can accommodate dry trees; and


• | Tension-Leg Platform (“TLP”): an appropriate platform for deepwater drilling and production in water depths up to approximately 1,500 meters, the TLP can be configured with full drilling or with tender assist and is generally a dry tree unit. The TLP and our topside can be integrated onto the substructure at a cost effective manner at quayside.

Floating Production Storage, and Offloading (“FPSO”). Working with our construction partners, we have delivered some of the largest FPSOs in the world. FPSOs enable offshore production and storage of oil which is then transported by a tanker where pipeline export is uneconomic or technically challenged (for example, ultra-deepwater). FPSOs utilize onshore processes adapted to a floating marine environment. They can support large topsides and hence large production capacities. 
Floating liquefied natural gas. We pioneered the FLNG industry and are working closely with our clients to engineer three of the industry’s first FLNG contracts: the Shell Prelude FLNG facility and the ENI Coral South FLNG project. We are the only contractor to integrate all the core activities required to deliver an FLNG project: LNG process, offshore facilities, loading systems, and subsea infrastructure. 
FLNG is an innovative alternative to traditional onshore LNG plants, and is suitable for remote and stranded gas fields that were deemed uneconomical previously. FLNG is a commercially attractive and environmentally friendly approach to the 
10

monetization of offshore gas fields. It avoids the potential environmental impact of building and operating long-distance pipelines and extensive onshore infrastructure.
Capital Intensity 
Our Onshore/Offshore business is executing turnkey contracts, performing engineering, procurement, construction, and project management for an entire or part of a facility. We can execute EPC contracts alone or in consortium with other companies.
Dependence on Key Customers
Generally, our Onshore/Offshore customers are major integrated oil companies or national oil companies. We have developed privileged relationships with our main clients around our portfolio of technologies, expertise in project management, and execution. Our customers have sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of their projects. 
One customer, JSC Yamal LNG, individually represented more than 10% of 2017 consolidated revenue. 
Competition
In the Onshore market, we face a large number of competitors, including U.S. companies (Bechtel, CB&I, Fluor, Jacobs and KBR), Japanese companies (Chiyoda Corporation, JGC Corporation and Toyo Engineering Corporation), European companies (Petrofac Ltd., Saipem, Tecnicas Reunidas, S.A., Maine Tecnimont Group and John Wood Group Plc) and Korean companies (GS Caltex Corporation, Hyundai Oilbank, Samsung Engineering Co., Ltd, SK Energy Co., Ltd., and Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd). In addition, we compete against smaller, specialized, and locally based engineering and construction companies in certain countries or for specific units such as petrochemicals.
Competition in the Offshore market is relatively fragmented and includes various players with different core capabilities, including offshore construction contractors, shipyards, leasing contractors, and local yards in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Competitors include Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd., Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., Saipem S.p.A., KBR, Inc., McDermott International Inc., China Offshore Oil Engineering Co. Ltd and JGC Corporation.
Seasonality
Our Onshore business is not sensitive to any seasonality. Our Offshore business could be impacted by seasonality in the North Sea region during the offshore installation campaign at the end of a project.
Market Environment 
The Onshore market is impacted by changes in oil and gas prices, but is typically more resilient than offshore markets. Indeed, some downstream markets have benefited from low commodity prices where market fundamentals are connected to other markets (for example, petrochemicals and fertilizers that are linked to world growth). This market is mostly present in developing countries with rapidly growing energy demand (in particular, in Asia) and countries with abundant oil and gas reserves that have decided to expand downstream (in particular, in the Middle East and Russia). The Onshore market remains relatively small in Western Europe, with a diversity of projects (including a second generation of bio ethanol plants). The North American Onshore market is experiencing a strong recovery in the wake of the oil and gas shale revolution.
The Offshore market is impacted by changes in oil prices. Offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the Middle East and the North Sea in Europe were the traditional backbone for investments in the last decade. Recent discoveries of offshore fields with reserves in other regions such as Brazil, Australia and East Africa are expected to become drivers of investment from some of our clients. In the long-term, gas is expected to be a major element of the energy mix, requiring new investments in the upstream industry. FLNG opportunities exist in the medium term, particularly in Australia and East Africa.
Strategy
Our strategy is based on the following:

• | selectivity of clients, projects, and geographies, which serves to maintain early engagement, leading to influence over technological choices, design considerations, and project specifications that make projects economically viable;


• | technology-driven differentiation with strong project management, which eliminates or significantly reduces technical and project risks, leading to both schedule and cost certainty without compromising safety; and

11


• | excellence in project execution, because of our global, multi-center project delivery model complemented by deep partnerships and alliances to ensure the best possible execution for complex projects.

TechnipFMC’s Onshore/Offshore segment continually invests in innovation and technology The Company is at the forefront of digital solutions due in part to our investment in 3D models and interfaces.
Recent and Future Developments
In response to industry challenges to improve project economics in the Offshore market, we are continuing our cost reduction efforts to align capacity and capabilities with market demands. Meanwhile, Onshore market activity continues to provide a tangible set of opportunities, including natural gas, refining and petrochemical projects. 
Activity in LNG is fueled by higher demand for natural gas as the fuel source continues to take a share of global energy demand. The trend is structural, driven by market preference for cleaner energy sources and the need to satisfy growing domestic demand in markets such as in the Middle East. To meet this demand, we believe that large gas projects will need to be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term. 
As Onshore market activity levels remain stable, it provides our business with the opportunity to remain actively engaged in and pursue front-end engineering studies, which provide the platform for early engagement with clients and can significantly reduce the risk of project execution. Market opportunities for downstream front-end engineering studies and full EPC projects are most prevalent in the Middle East, African and Asian markets in both LNG and refining. We continue to track near-term prospects for petrochemical and fertilizer projects as well. We believe this opportunity set could generate additional inbound orders in the coming years.
Product Development
We are positioned as a premier provider of project execution strategy and technology solutions which enable our customers to unlock resources at advantaged capital and operating economics. We invest Onshore/Offshore R&D in these main areas: (i) the development of process technology and equipment for economy of scale, (ii) continuous improvement of our proprietary process technologies and other solutions to reduce operating and investment cost, and (iii) intensification and diversification of our proprietary technology offering. 
Our Offshore R&D efforts are focused on improving the economics of FLNG through innovations in design and constructibility. We also launched a new program to develop solutions for smaller scale FLNG and LNG import projects.

We manufacture most of our products in several facilities located worldwide. 
Principal Products and Services
Integrated Surface Drilling, Completion, and Production Systems. We provide a full range of drilling, completion and production wellhead systems for both standard and custom-engineered applications. Surface wellhead production systems, or 
12

trees, are used to control and regulate the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the well. Our surface wellhead products and systems are used worldwide on both onshore and offshore applications and can be used in difficult climates, including arctic cold or desert high temperatures. Our product technologies include conventional wellheads, unihead drill-thru wellheads designed for faster surface installations, drilling time optimization time saving conventional wellheads designed to reduce overall rig time, and other technologies, including sealing technology, thermal equipment, and valves and actuators.
We support our customers through comprehensive surface wellhead system service packages that provide strategic solutions to ensure optimal equipment performance and reliability. These service packages include all phases of the asset’s life cycle, from the early planning stages, through testing and installation, commissioning and operations, replacement and upgrades, interventions, decommissioning/abandonment, and maintenance, storage and preservations.
As part of our surface integrated services business, we provide an integrated shale offering, which includes manifolds, trees and flowback equipment for timely and cost-effective well completion. We also provide flowback services for the recovery of solids, fluids, and hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells after the stimulation of the well, and well optimization services for exploration companies in the oil and gas industry.
Pressure Control. We design and manufacture flowline products, under the Weco®/Chiksan® trademarks, articulating frac arm manifold trailers, well service pumps, compact valves and reciprocating pumps used in well completion and stimulation activities by major oilfield service companies, such as Halliburton Company, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, a GE Company and Weatherford International plc. Our flowline products are used in equipment that pumps fluid into a well during the well construction and stimulation processes. Our well service pump product line includes triplex and quintuplex pumps utilized in a variety of applications, including fracturing, acidizing and matrix stimulation, and are capable of delivering flow rates up to 35 barrels per minute at pressures up to 20,000 psi. The performance of this business typically rises and falls with variations in the active rig count throughout the world and pressure pumping activity and intensity in the Americas.
Measurement Solutions. We design, manufacture and service measurement products for the worldwide oil and gas industry. Our flow computers and control systems manage and monitor liquid and gas measurement for applications such as custody transfer, fiscal measurement and batch loading and deliveries. Our FPSO metering systems provide the precision and reliability required for measuring large flow rates characteristic of marine loading operations. Our gas and liquid measurement systems provide many solutions in energy-related applications such as crude oil and natural gas production and transportation, refined product transportation, petroleum refining and petroleum marketing and distribution. We combine advanced measurement technology with state-of-the-art electronics and supervisory control systems to provide the measurement of both liquids and gases to ensure processes operate efficiently while reducing operating costs and minimizing the risk associated with custody transfer.
Loading Systems. We provide land- and marine-based loading and transfer systems to the oil and gas, petrochemical and chemical industries. Our systems provide transfer loading solutions using Chiksan® loading arms and Chiksan® swivel joint technologies, which are capable of diverse applications. While our marine systems are typically constructed on a fixed jetty platform, we have developed advanced loading systems that can be mounted on a vessel or structure to facilitate ship-to-ship and tandem loading and offloading operations in open seas or exposed locations. Both our land- and marine-based loading and transfer systems are capable of handling a wide range of products including petroleum products, LNG and chemical products.
Capital Intensity
Surface Technologies manufactures most of its products, resulting in a reliance on manufacturing locations throughout the world. We also maintain a large amount of rental equipment related to pressure operations.
Dependence on Key Customers
No single Surface Technologies customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2017 consolidated revenue.
Competition
Surface Technologies is a market leader for our primary products and services. Some of the factors that distinguish us from other companies in the same sector include our technological innovation, reliability and product quality. Surface Technologies competes with other companies that supply surface production equipment and pressure control products. Some of our major competitors in Surface Technologies include Cameron International Corporation (a Schlumberger company), Weir Oil & Gas (a division of The Weir Group PLC), Baker Hughes, a GE Company, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and Gardner Denver, Inc.
Seasonality
In Western Canada, the level of activity in the oilfield services industry is influenced by seasonal weather patterns. During the spring months, wet weather and the spring thaw make the ground unstable and less capable of supporting heavy equipment and 
13

machinery. As a result, municipalities and provincial transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of heavy equipment during the spring months, which reduces activity levels. There is greater demand for oilfield services, specifically completion services, provided by our Canadian surface integrated services business in the winter season when freezing permits the movement and operation of heavy equipment. Activities tend to increase in the fall and peak in the winter months of November through March.
Market Environment
While the North American rig count and market activity have steadily improved over the last year, the recovery has been constrained to certain oil and gas producing basins that can generate acceptable returns. The market recovery began in late 2016 in North America and continued through 2017. This increased activity has resulted in stronger demand for the Company’s products and services, particularly pressure control equipment. Activity outside of North America remains generally stable but continues to experience competitive pricing pressure in certain markets. 
Strategy
Our strategy is focused on being a leading provider of best-cost and high-performance integrated assets and services for its customers in the drilling, completion, production, midstream and transportation sectors. We intend to grow and expand by focusing on improving customer economics and providing superior service.
Recent and Future Developments
We continue to operate in a challenging environment because of lower global activity and competitive pricing. North America rig count and operating activity have been steadily improving through 2017. The market has also benefited from increased service intensity related to hydraulic fracturing activity. As a result of these market dynamics, we have experienced stronger demand for pressure control equipment. Combined with our cost rationalization initiatives, we are capturing the economic benefits of the higher activity levels. In North America, we believe that we will see further market improvements, primarily driven by increased unconventional activity.
Outside of North America, we expect global activity levels to improve in 2018. In our business, we believe that the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Europe are best poised for growth.While our international surface business experienced competitive pricing pressure throughout 2017, pricing has stabilized, with limited improvement in a few select international markets. We expect this pricing environment to continue throughout 2018.
Product Development
In 2017, we successfully launched the 2” 10,000 psi cage choke expanding the Company’s traditional product offering for onshore solutions and delivering our first order to a major Middle East customer. We also launched a fully automated and digitized Flow Testing Advanced Automated Package (AAP) leveraging the Company’s superior de-sanding technology and digital platform, which allows for remote monitoring and real-time data capture via the cloud.
Acquisitions and Investments
In October 2017, we announced an agreement to acquire Plexus Holding plc’s (“Plexus”) Wellhead exploration equipment and services business for jack up applications. In conjunction with our global footprint and market presence, this portfolio expansion in the mudline and high pressure, high temperature arena will enable us to be a leading provider of products and services to the global jack up exploration drilling market. This acquisition fits within our strategy to extend and strengthen our position in exploration-drilling products and services while leveraging our global field presence.
The business will be integrated into the our Surface Technologies segment and will include the transfer of key personnel from Plexus, with their specialized know-how, to ensure continuity and ongoing customer support. The business will continue to operate from the existing location in Dyce, Aberdeen, United Kingdom. 
In December 2017, we opened a fully capable 18,000 square meter Surface international facility in Abu Dhabi’s Industrial City 2, as part of our continued investment in the United Arab Emirates to reinforce our leading position in delivering local solutions that extend asset life and improve returns for Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (“ADNOC”) and other customers. The launch of this facility positions us to respond to the expected increase in ADNOC activity in 2018 and beyond.
The new plant is part of a program to strengthen our capabilities in the Surface international business, but also provides a solid platform for us to grow our integrated offerings into the Middle East, including multiple product lines and aftermarket services that are key to the strategy. The new facility will offer a broader range of capabilities in-country, supporting our full portfolio with our high technology equipment in the drilling, completion, production, and pressure control sectors. The facility includes a 
14

fully-developed training center, high-pressure hydraulic and gas testing capabilities, state of the art cladding, and machining technology and one-stop-shop for customer equipment storage, preservation, preparation, and make-up for mobilization to the field.
