The Companys display product line is comprised of two distinct segments: the Digital product sales division and the Digital product lease and maintenance division.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
 
In North America, the Company markets its digital display products in the United States and Canada using a combination of distribution channels, including direct sales representatives and a network of independent dealers and distributors.  By working with software vendors and using the internet to expand the quality and quantity of multimedia content that can be delivered to our digital products, we offer customers relevant, timely information, content management software and display hardware in the form of turnkey display communications packages.
 
The Company employs a number of different marketing techniques to attract new customers, including direct marketing efforts by its sales force to known and potential users of information displays; internet marketing; advertising in industry publications; and exhibiting at domestic and international trade shows annually.
 
Headquartered in New York, New York, the Company has sales and service offices in Des Moines, Iowa, and Hazelwood, Missouri, as well as satellite offices in other parts of the United States.

The Company has the ability to modify its product lines.  The Companys displays are designed with flexibility in mind, enabling the Company to customize its displays to meet different applications with a minimum amount of lead-time.  The Company designs certain of its materials to match components furnished by suppliers.  If such suppliers are unable to provide the Company with those components, the Company would have to contract with other suppliers to obtain replacement sources.  Such replacement might result in engineering design changes, as well as delays in obtaining such replacement components.  The Company believes it maintains suitable inventory and has contracts providing for delivery of sufficient quantities of such components to meet its needs.  The Company also believes that there are presently other qualified vendors of these components.  Other than the LEDs and LED modules which are manufactured by foreign sources, the Company does not acquire significant amounts of components directly from foreign suppliers.  The Companys products are third-party certified for compliance with applicable safety, electromagnetic emissions and susceptibility requirements worldwide.
SERVICE AND SUPPORT
 
The Company emphasizes the quality and reliability of its products and the ability of its field service personnel and third-party agents to provide timely and expert service to the Companys equipment on lease and maintenance bases and other types of customer-owned equipment.  The Company believes that the quality and timeliness of its on-site service personnel are essential components for the Companys ongoing and future success.  The Company provides turnkey installation and support for the products it leases and sells in the United States and Canada.  The Company provides training to end-users and provides ongoing support to users who have questions regarding operating procedures, equipment problems or other issues.  The Company provides installation and service to those who purchase and lease equipment.  Additionally, the Companys dealers and distributors offer support for the products they sell in the market segments they cover.
 
Personnel based in regional and satellite service locations throughout the United States and Canada provide high quality and timely on-site service for the installed equipment on lease and maintenance bases and other types of customer-owned equipment.  Purchasers or lessees of the Companys larger products, such as financial exchanges, casinos and sports stadiums, often retain the Company to provide on-site service through the deployment of a service technician who is on-site daily for scheduled events.  
 
The Company operates its National Technical Services and Repair Centers from its facilities in Des Moines, Iowa and Hazelwood, Missouri. Equipment repairs are performed in Des Moines, Iowa and service technicians are dispatched nationwide from various locations including Des Moines and Hazelwood. The Companys field service division is augmented by various service companies in the United States, Canada and overseas. From time to time, the Company uses various third-party service agents to install, service and/or assist in the service of certain displays for reasons that include geographic area, size and height of displays.
 
COMPETITION
 
The Companys availability of short and long-term leases to customers and its nationwide sales, service and installation capabilities are major competitive advantages in the digital product business. The Company believes that it is the largest supplier of large-scale stock, commodity, sports and race book gaming digital products in the United States, as well as one of the larger digital product and service organizations in the country.
