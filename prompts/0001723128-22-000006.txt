Item 1. Business
Overview
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a pharmaceutical company specializing in developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing generic and branded specialty pharmaceutical products across a broad array of dosage forms and therapeutic areas. The Company operates principally in the United States, India, and Ireland, and sells to wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, chain pharmacies and individual pharmacies, either directly or indirectly. The Company is a holding company, whose principal assets are common units (“Amneal Common Units”) of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Amneal”). In 2018, Amneal completed the acquisition of Impax Laboratories, Inc. (“Impax”), a generic and specialty pharmaceutical company. 
The group, together with their affiliates and certain assignees, who owned Amneal when it was a private company (the “Amneal Group”) held 50.4% of Amneal Common Units and the Company held the remaining 49.6% as of December 31, 2021. Although the Company has a minority economic interest in Amneal, it is Amneal’s sole managing member, having the sole voting power to make all of Amneal’s business decisions and control its management. Therefore, the Company consolidates the financial statements of Amneal and its subsidiaries. The Company records non-controlling interests for the portion of Amneal’s economic interests that it does not hold.
Acquisitions
Baclofen Franchise 
On December 30, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with certain entities affiliated with Saol International Limited (collectively, “Saol”), a private specialty pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Saol’s baclofen franchise, including Lioresal®, LYVISPAH™, and a pipeline product under development (the “Saol Acquisition”). The Saol Acquisition expands our commercial institutional and specialty portfolio in neurology while adding commercial infrastructure in advance of our entry into the biosimilar institutional market. Consideration for the Saol Acquisition includes approximately $85 million, paid at closing with cash on hand, and contingent royalty payments based on annual net sales for certain acquired assets, beginning in 2023. The transaction closed on February 9, 2022.
Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. 
On November 2, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (“Puniska”), a privately held manufacturer of parenteral and injectable drugs in India. Upon execution of the agreement, we acquired a 74% controlling interest in the equity of Puniska and will acquire the remaining 26% of the equity upon approval of the transaction by the government of India, which is expected during the first half of 2022.
Kashiv Specialty Pharmaceuticals, LLC
On April 2, 2021, the Company and Kashiv Biosciences, LLC (a related party, refer to Note 24. Related Party Transactions) (“Kashiv”) closed on a transaction for Amneal to acquire a 98% controlling interest in Kashiv Specialty Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“KSP”), a subsidiary of Kashiv focused on the development of innovative drug delivery platforms, novel 505(b)(2) drugs, and complex generics. 
AvKARE, LLC and R&S Northeast LLC
On January 31, 2020, we acquired a 65.1% controlling interest in both AvKARE Inc., a Tennessee corporation now a limited liability company (“AvKARE, LLC”), and Dixon-Shane, LLC d/b/a R&S Northeast LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company (“R&S”) (collectively, the “Rondo Acquisitions”). AvKARE, LLC is one of the largest private label providers of generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. federal agency sector, primarily focused on serving the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. R&S is a national pharmaceutical wholesaler focused primarily on offering 340b-qualified entities products to provide consistency in care and pricing. 
For additional information about our acquisitions, refer to Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 29. Subsequent Event in our consolidated financial statements. 

Segments of the Business
We have three reportable segments: Generics, Specialty, and AvKARE. 
Generics
Prescription pharmaceutical products are sold either as branded or generic products. Generic pharmaceutical products have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), dosage form, potency, route of administration, and intended use as patented branded pharmaceutical products and are usually marketed under their chemical (generic) names rather than brand names. However, generic pharmaceutical products are intended to provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers while maintaining the safety, efficacy and stability of the branded product, and as such are generally sold at prices below their branded equivalents. Typically, a generic pharmaceutical may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless the resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic manufacturers are required to file and receive approval for an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) in order to market a generic pharmaceutical product. In general, those companies that are able to prepare high quality ANDA submissions are comparatively advantaged. 
Our Generics segment includes approximately 250 product families covering an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including both immediate and extended release oral solids, powders, liquids, sterile injectables, nasal sprays, inhalation and respiratory products, ophthalmics (which are sterile pharmaceutical preparations administered for ocular conditions), films, transdermal patches and topicals (which are creams or gels designed to administer pharmaceuticals locally through the skin). We focus on developing products with substantial barriers-to-entry resulting from complex drug formulations or manufacturing, or legal or regulatory challenges. Focusing on these opportunities allows us to offer first-to-file (“FTF”), first-to-market (“FTM”) and other high-value products. A generic pharmaceutical product is considered a FTF product if the ANDA filed with respect to such product is the first to be filed for such product. Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, FTF products may receive a statutory 180-day exclusivity period, subject to certain conditions. For all reasons other than statutory exclusivity, a generic product is considered an FTM product if it is the first marketed generic version of a branded pharmaceutical. We define high-value products as products with three or fewer generic competitors at the time of launch. FTF, FTM and high-value products tend to be more profitable and often have longer life cycles than other generic pharmaceuticals. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on our financial results. Market entry by additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of our control. Refer to “Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States,” below, for more information.
As of December 31, 2021, our Generics segment had 114 products with a pending ANDA and another 128 products in various stages of development in our pipeline, 87% of which are non-oral solid products. Our generic pipeline consists of what we believe to be potential FTF, FTM and high-value products. We have an integrated, team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities.
Our Generics segment had net sales of $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion and operating income (loss) of $281 million, $189 million and $(133) million, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Specialty
Our Specialty segment is engaged in the development, promotion, sale and distribution of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on products addressing central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders, including migraine and Parkinson’s disease. Our portfolio of products includes Rytary®, an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication. In addition to Rytary®, our promoted Specialty portfolio also includes Unithroid® (levothyroxine sodium), for the treatment of hypothyroidism, which is sold under a license and distribution agreement with Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Emverm® (mebendazole) 100 mg chewable tablets, for the treatment of pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm and American hookworm in single or mixed infections.
For Specialty products, the majority of the product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S., when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales. For example, the pediatric exclusivity of the AstraZeneca patent licensed to Impax for Zomig® Nasal Spray expired in May 2021 and we lost market exclusivity in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our sales of Zomig ® Nasal Spray for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $30 million, a decline of $10 million, from the prior year period. The year over year decline was, in part, due to the loss of market exclusivity. 

Our Specialty segment had net sales of $378 million, $356 million and $318 million and operating income of $56 million, $57 million and $43 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
AvKARE
Our AvKARE segment provides pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical products, and services primarily to governmental agencies. AvKARE is a re-packager of bottle and unit dose pharmaceuticals under the registered names of AvKARE and AvPAK, which service the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs as well as institutional customers. AvKARE is also a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals, over the counter products and medical supplies to institutional customers located throughout the United States of America focused primarily on offering 340b-qualified entities products to provide consistency in care and pricing.
Our AvKARE segment had net sales of $349 million and $294 million and operating income (loss) of $7 million and ($8) million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We did not have an AvKARE segment prior to the closing of the Rondo Acquisitions.
Geographic Areas
We operate in the United States, India, and Ireland. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. See further discussion of this risk in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Sales & Marketing and Customers
In the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, we market our Generics and Specialty products primarily through wholesalers and distributors, retail pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and directly into hospitals and institutions. The majority of our generic pharmaceutical products are marketed to large group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) and sold through wholesalers, directly to large chain retailers or to mail order customers. Our sterile injectable products are generally marketed to GPOs and specialty distributors, and sold through wholesalers, and occasionally directly to large hospitals and institutions. All of our wholesalers purchase products and warehouse them for retail drug stores, independent pharmacies and managed care organizations, such as hospitals, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail-order customers. Our Specialty segment, which promotes branded pharmaceutical products, employs a team of dedicated field based sales representatives to engage in the direct marketing and promotion of our branded products to physicians and healthcare providers.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis, our three largest customers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, and McKesson Drug Co., accounted for approximately 65% of our net revenue. In total, we currently have over 1,000 customers (including over 800 customers specific to our AvKARE segment), some of which are part of large purchasing groups. 
We have no long-term agreements that guarantee future business with any of our major customers and the loss of or substantial reduction in orders from any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, future prospects and financial condition.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is affected by new technologies, new developments, government regulations, health care legislation, availability of financing, and other factors. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing, and other resources than we do. Competing manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products create value for our customers by offering substitutes for branded pharmaceutical products at significantly lower prices, and at times we may not be able to differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors, successfully formulate and bring to market new products that are less expensive than those of our competitors or offer commercial terms as favorable as those of our competitors. We compete with numerous other companies that currently operate, or intend to operate, in the pharmaceutical industry, including companies that are engaged in the development of controlled-release drug delivery technologies and products, and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake development of such products. Our principal competitors in the generic pharmaceutical products market include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Viatris Inc., Endo International plc, Sandoz International GmbH, Pfizer Inc., Fresenius Kabi 
KGaA, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., and Aurobindo Pharma Limited.
By focusing on our high-value products with complex dosage forms and high barriers to entry, as well as taking advantage of our vertically integrated supply chain and selective use of internal API, we aim to manufacture more profitable products relative to our competition. However, this or any future strategy may not enable us to compete successfully in the generic pharmaceutical industry.
The Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and provided for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for each applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification. The holder of the approved ANDA that successfully challenges the relevant innovator drug patent(s) usually enjoys higher market share and sales during the 180-day period of exclusivity. When the exclusivity period concludes, other generic competitors may launch their versions of the product, which may cause significant price erosion and loss of market share. In cases where we are the holder of an ANDA for a FTF product, upon the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period, we may adjust the price of such product and provide price adjustments to our customers for the difference between the lower price and the price at which we previously sold the product then held in inventory by our customers. These adjustments are commonly known as shelf stock adjustments. In certain circumstances, we may decide not to provide price adjustments to certain customers and, as a result, we may receive returns of unsold product from these customers and forego future sales volume as opposed to reducing pricing.
Authorized generic pharmaceutical products, which are generic labeled versions of pharmaceutical products introduced by brand companies (directly or through a third party) under the brand’s new drug application (“NDA”), have also increased competition in the generic pharmaceutical industry. Authorized generic pharmaceutical products may be sold prior to, during and subsequent to the 180-day exclusivity period and are a significant source of competition, because brand companies do not face any regulatory barriers to rapidly introducing generic versions of their pharmaceutical products.
Additionally, consolidation among wholesalers and retailers and the formation of GPOs has caused increased price competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The downward price adjustments demanded by distributors of generic pharmaceutical products have reduced revenue and average product gross margin across the industry. Should these price reductions continue or even increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin.  Further, even if we reduce the prices we charge our customers, that does not ensure that the prices consumers pay for those drugs will be similarly reduced.  
The main competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include:
•a generic pharmaceutical products manufacturer’s ability to rapidly develop and obtain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities of generic pharmaceutical products;
•the introduction of other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers’ products in direct competition with our products;
•the introduction of authorized generic pharmaceutical products in direct competition with our products;
•consolidation among our customers and the formation of buyer consortia;
•pricing pressures by competitors and customers, even if similar price savings are not passed on to consumers;
•product quality of our generic pharmaceutical competitors;
•our and our competitors’ breadth of product offerings across its portfolio;
•our ability and the ability of our generic pharmaceutical competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or statutory exclusivity periods, limiting the extent and duration of profitability for our products;
•the willingness of our customers to switch their source of supply of products among various generic pharmaceutical competitors;
•the ability of our generic pharmaceutical competitors to identify and market niche products;
•our and our competitors’ level of service (including maintenance of inventories for timely delivery) and reputation as a reliable developer and manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products; and
•product appearance and labeling for our products and those of our competitors.
In the brand-name pharmaceutical market, our principal competitors are pharmaceutical companies that are focused on Parkinson’s disease and other CNS disorders. In addition, with respect to products that we are developing internally and/or any additional products we may in-license from third parties, we expect that we will face increased competition from large pharmaceutical companies, drug delivery companies and other specialty pharmaceutical companies that have focused on the same disorders as our branded products.

Research and Development
Research and development (“R&D”) activities represent a significant part of our business. R&D expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy, if applicable, and regulatory compliance prior to launch. We are committed to investing in R&D with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our R&D expense was $202 million, $180 million and $188 million, respectively.
Raw Materials
Raw materials, including APIs, essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources. We purchase raw materials from distributors of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals and we also manufacture certain APIs at our facilities in India. In some cases, however, the raw materials used to manufacture our products are available only from a single supplier. Further, even if more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and have done so in the case of our API suppliers for a majority of our products, to list only one supplier in our product applications submitted to the FDA. Generally, we would need as long as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year’s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. Although to date we have only experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such raw materials. Any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases not passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Because legal and regulatory requirements mandate that our product marketing authorizations specify API and raw material suppliers, if a specified supplier were for any reason unable to continue to supply us, we would need to seek FDA approval of a new supplier. The resulting delay in the manufacture and marketing of the impacted pharmaceutical product during the FDA process to qualify and approve the new supplier could, depending on the product, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We protect against the risk of such an event by generally providing for, where feasible, two or more suppliers of raw materials for the pharmaceutical products we manufacture, including those for which we manufacture API in-house. Additionally, we may enter into a contract with a raw material distributor in order to secure adequate supply for specific products.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We have a network of manufacturing sites and co-located R&D centers within the United States, India and Ireland, with broad dosage capabilities. We also have a distribution center for our Generics and Specialty products in Glasgow, Kentucky and a packaging center in East Hanover, New Jersey. We manufacture the majority of our Generics products internally; of these products, for the year ended December 31, 2021, those manufactured in our U.S. facilities contributed 48% of Generics product net revenue compared to 28% for those manufactured in India. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply a small number of products in our Generics portfolio representing approximately 24% of our Generics net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.  Most of our Specialty products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers. In addition, we selectively manufacture API for a subset of our products, which helps to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing for our products and gives us greater control over our supply chain.
Our AvKARE distribution centers are located in Fountain Run, Kentucky and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Government Regulation
The business of developing, manufacturing, selling, distributing, and marketing generic and branded products is subject to significant health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the approval and pricing of products, clinical trials, laboratory procedures, privacy of health information and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. These regulatory regimes are overseen by governmental bodies, principally the FDA and, as applicable, the Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and several state and local government agencies in the United States and abroad. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of these governmental agencies may result in legal or other enforcement actions, including suspension of regulatory approval, delays in regulatory approval, clinical holds, orders to cease non-compliant activities and potential civil and criminal actions against us. The regulatory environment, particularly enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly in flux and not always clear. Significant changes in this environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), the Controlled Substances Act, the regulations that implement these laws and other statutes and regulations govern the development, testing, manufacture, packaging, use, distribution, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, marketing, sale, and promotion of our products, as well as post-marketing requirements for safety surveillance and reporting. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in judicial and or administrative sanctions, such as warning letters, recalls, product seizures, injunctions, fines, total or partial suspension of distribution or production, exclusion or debarment from government programs and contracts, restitution, disgorgement and criminal prosecutions. The FDA has the authority to withdraw its approval of pharmaceuticals at any time, in accordance with its regulatory due process procedures, and can enforce the recall of products.
Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals under the FDCA and the PHSA. In order to market a drug or biologic, considerable data demonstrating its safety, efficacy, quality, purity, and potency must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval. Generally, the following types of applications are used to obtain FDA approval if the FDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective for its intended use.
New Drug Application
For a drug product containing an active ingredient not previously approved by the FDA, a prospective manufacturer must submit a complete application containing the results of clinical studies supporting the drug product’s safety and efficacy. A NDA is also required for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if the drug will be used to treat an indication for which the drug was not previously approved or if the dosage form, strength or method of delivery is changed. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves the steps listed below, which could take from approximately three to more than ten years to complete.
•Laboratory and clinical tests;
•Submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical studies may begin;
•Adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;
•Submission of a NDA containing the results of the preclinical tests and clinical studies establishing the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use, as well as extensive data addressing such matters such as manufacturing and quality assurance;
•Scale-up to commercial manufacturing; and
•FDA approval of a NDA.
As noted above, the submission of a NDA is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. It may refuse to file the application and instead request additional information, in which case, the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. After the application is deemed filed by the FDA, FDA staff will review a NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and efficacious for its intended use.
If, after reviewing the NDA, the FDA determines that the application cannot be approved in its current form, the FDA sends the NDA applicant a Complete Response Letter identifying all outstanding deficiencies that preclude final approval. The FDA then halts its review until the applicant resubmits the NDA with new information designed to address the deficiencies. An applicant receiving a Complete Response Letter may resubmit the application with data and information addressing the FDA’s concerns or requirements, withdraw the application without prejudice to a subsequent submission of a related application or request a hearing on whether there are grounds for denying approval of the application. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, in each case compared to the approval sought, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require an applicant to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market. The agency may also impose requirements that the NDA holder conduct new studies, make labeling changes, implement Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, and take other corrective measures.

Abbreviated New Drug Application
For a generic version of an approved drug (in other words, a drug product that contains the same active ingredient as a drug previously approved by the FDA and is in the same dosage form and strength, utilizes the same method of delivery and will be used to treat the same indications as the approved product), the FDA requires only an abbreviated new drug application that ordinarily need not include clinical studies demonstrating safety and efficacy. An ANDA typically requires only data demonstrating that the generic formulation is bioequivalent to the previously approved “reference listed drug,” indicating that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the reference listed drug. In July 2012, the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (“GDUFA”) were enacted into law. The GDUFA legislation implemented fees for new ANDA applications, Drug Master Files, product and establishment fees and a one-time fee for back-logged ANDA applications pending approval as of October 1, 2012. In return, the program was intended to provide faster and more predictable ANDA reviews by the FDA and increased inspections of drug facilities. Under GDUFA, generic product companies face significant penalties for failure to pay the new user fees, including rendering an ANDA application not “substantially complete” until the fee is paid. Prior to the implementation of GDUFA, the FDA took an average of approximately 32-34 months to approve an ANDA. Following the implementation of GDUFA, the FDA’s stated internal goal for ANDAs was to have a “first-action” goal date within 15 months of submission on 75% of submitted ANDAs. The “first-action” goal date is referred to by the FDA as the date in which the FDA takes a first action on an application by either granting approval or tentative approval or in the event of deficiencies, identifying those deficiencies in a complete response letter or in a refusal to receive the application. Under the previous GDUFA authorization, the time required to obtain FDA approval of ANDAs was on average approximately 32-34 months post-filing. In August 2017, GDUFA was reauthorized through September 30, 2022. As a result of GDUFA II, we expect the average time required to achieve approval of a generic pharmaceutical product after making an ANDA filing to decrease. In July 2020, FDA held a public meeting and started the process for reauthorization of GDUFA II (“GDUFA III”), which requires consultations with certain congressional committees, representatives of patient and consumer advocacy organizations, health care professionals, scientific and academic experts, and the generic drug industry. The FDA’s commitment letter for GDUFA III, which sets forth performance goals and program enhancements for the reauthorization of GDUFA for FY2023-2027, sets goals for FDA’s assessment and review of different ANDA submissions and includes enhancements designed to reduce the number of assessment cycles for ANDAs and facilitate access to generic drugs.
The Hatch-Waxman Act established the modern regulatory system for generic pharmaceutical products by creating a standardized approach for generic pharmaceutical makers to file ANDAs and receive FDA approval for generic pharmaceutical products. In order to gain FDA approval, there are various regulatory hurdles that a prospective generic manufacturer must clear:
Current Good Manufacturing Practices 
In order to obtain FDA approval for its products, a pharmaceutical manufacturer must demonstrate that its facilities comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations. The manufacturer is required to comply with cGMP standards at all times during the production and processing of pharmaceuticals, and the FDA may inspect the manufacturer’s sites at any time to ensure compliance.
Safety and Efficacy
With respect to ANDA filings for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, the FDA waives the requirement for certain clinical trials because the manufacturer of the brand pharmaceutical product has already performed these studies and established the safety and efficacy of the reference pharmaceutical product. However, an ANDA filer is still required to conduct bioequivalence studies to test the generic pharmaceutical product against the brand pharmaceutical product. For most orally administered pharmaceutical products, bioequivalence between brand and generic is established when there is no statistically significant difference in the rate and extent to which the API from the product is absorbed into the bloodstream. For certain pharmaceutical products, such as topical, locally acting pharmaceutical products, other means of establishing bioequivalence may be required by the FDA. Additionally, an ANDA for a generic pharmaceutical product must contain other information, such as patent certifications and stability, chemistry, manufacturing and labeling data.
Patent Provisions
A branded pharmaceutical product is usually protected under patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that allow only the pharmaceutical company that developed the pharmaceutical product to market and sell such product. For a 

generic pharmaceutical manufacturer to introduce a generic version of a referenced branded pharmaceutical product, it must submit to the FDA an ANDA with a certification stating one of the following:
•Paragraph I: That the required patent information relating to the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product has not been filed;
•Paragraph II: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product has expired;
•Paragraph III: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product will expire on a particular date; or
•Paragraph IV: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product is invalid and/or will not be infringed by the pharmaceutical product for which approval is being sought
Filing an ANDA with certifications under Paragraph I or II, referenced above, permits the ANDA to be approved immediately, if it is otherwise eligible. Filing an ANDA with certifications under Paragraph III, referenced above, indicates that the ANDA may be approved on the expiration date of the referenced branded pharmaceutical product’s patent. Under Paragraph IV, referenced above, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer can challenge the patent of the branded referenced pharmaceutical product.
If the ANDA for a generic pharmaceutical product has a Paragraph IV certification, the filer must also notify the NDA and patent holders upon acceptance of the ANDA filing by the FDA (the “PIV Notice”). The NDA and patent holders may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response, the filing of which automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of (i) 30 months following receipt of the PIV Notice and/or (ii) a decision in the lawsuit that is favorable to the ANDA filer.
Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing
The pricing of a generic pharmaceutical product generally correlates to the number of companies manufacturing generic versions of such pharmaceutical product. A generic pharmaceutical product is usually at its highest price immediately after the first generic launch of the product, either because a single manufacturer has been granted 180-day exclusivity or because only a few manufacturers have entered the market due to other technical or operational obstacles to bringing such product to market, such as raw materials shortages or complex formulation. As additional generic manufacturers enter the market, the price of a generic pharmaceutical product typically falls as manufacturers compete on price to capture market share.  Even if we reduce the prices we charge our customers, the prices consumers pay for those drugs may not be similarly reduced.  Additionally, consolidation among wholesalers and retailers and the formation of GPOs has caused increased price competition in the generic pharmaceutical market.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have recently been multiple federal and state proposals related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other changes to the healthcare system. It is currently unclear what, if any, legislative proposals may be adopted or how governmental bodies and private payors will respond to such healthcare reform. As such, we cannot predict the impact of potential legislation on our business and cannot guarantee that such legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Pharmaceutical Pedigree Laws
Various pharmaceutical pedigree laws, such as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act enacted in 2014, require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription pharmaceutical products from the manufacturer to the dispensary (e.g., pharmacy). Compliance with such laws requires extensive tracking systems and tight coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we believe that we comply with these laws and we intend to do so in the future, such legislation and government enforcement regarding these laws is constantly evolving. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties or loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements
Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, generic and brand pharmaceutical companies must file with the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and FTC certain agreements entered into between other brand and/or generic pharmaceutical companies in regards to the settlement of patent litigation and/or the manufacture and marketing of generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products. This requirement impacts the ways in which generic 

pharmaceutical companies resolve intellectual property litigation and may result in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies and/or additional investigations by the FTC or other governmental organizations.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are subject to the Maximum Allowable Cost Regulations, which limit reimbursements for certain generic prescription drugs under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs to the lowest price at which these drugs are generally available. In many instances, only generic prescription drugs fall within the regulations’ limits. Generally, the pricing and promotion of, method of reimbursement and fixing of reimbursement levels for, and the reporting to federal and state agencies relating to drug products is under active review by federal, state and local governmental entities, as well as by private third-party reimbursors and individuals under whistleblower statutes. At present, the DOJ and U.S. Attorneys Offices and State Attorneys General have initiated investigations, reviews, and litigation into industry-wide pharmaceutical pricing and promotional practices, and whistleblowers have filed qui tam suits. We cannot predict the results of those reviews, investigations, and litigation, or their impact on our business. For further detail, see Note 21. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.
Virtually every state, as well as the District of Columbia, has enacted legislation permitting the substitution of equivalent generic prescription drugs for brand-name drugs where authorized or not prohibited by the prescribing physician, and some states mandate generic substitution in Medicaid programs.
In addition, numerous state and federal requirements exist for a variety of controlled substances, such as narcotics, that may be part of our product formulations. The DEA, which has authority similar to the FDA’s and may also pursue monetary penalties, and other federal and state regulatory agencies have far reaching authority.
The State of California requires that any manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or other entity in California that sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes certain so called precursor substances must have a permit issued by the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. The substances covered by this requirement include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, among others. The Bureau has authority to issue, suspend and revoke precursor permits, and a permit may be denied, revoked or suspended for various reasons, including (i) failure to maintain effective controls against diversion of precursors to unauthorized persons or entities; (ii) failure to comply with the Health and Safety Code provisions relating to precursor substances, or any regulations adopted thereunder; (iii) commission of any act which would demonstrate actual or potential unfitness to hold a permit in light of the public safety and welfare, which act is substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of the permit holder; or (iv) if any individual owner, manager, agent, representative or employee of the permit applicant/permit holder willfully violates any federal, state or local criminal statute, rule, or ordinance relating to the manufacture, maintenance, disposal, sale, transfer or furnishing of any precursor substances.
Environmental Laws
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by various environmental regulatory agencies. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and product candidates and have also developed brand names and trademarks for other products and product candidates.
Generally, the brand pharmaceutical business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license.
In the branded pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded 

product’s sales. The rate of this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection.
An innovator product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, the U.S., the European Union and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator’s data to approve a competitor’s generic copy. Regulatory exclusivity rights are also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications, on orphan drugs and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity rights are independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor’s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. We cannot assure that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.
In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, we also market products with trademarks. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely.
Seasonality
Consistent with the United States pharmaceutical industry trends, the first quarter of each year, excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, is typically our lowest revenue quarter in the year. Certain products of our portfolio are specifically affected by seasonality. For example, sales of oseltamivir correlate with flu seasonality and sales of Adrenaclick® (epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector) correlate with allergy seasonality. The seasonal impact of these particular products may affect a quarterly comparison within any fiscal year.
Human Capital
We have always operated the Company from a people-first mindset, recognizing that it is our people who generate ideas, operate machinery and deliver success. Since our founding in 2002, we have focused on recruiting, empowering, incentivizing and rewarding employees who are passionately engaged in our mission to make healthy possible and that commitment remained steady in 2021. 
Workforce Demographics and Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,000 employees (“Amneal Employees”), excluding approximately 200 employees in our AvKARE segment. Of the Amneal Employees, approximately 2,300 employees were located in the United States and approximately 4,700 employees were located outside of the United States, primarily in India and Ireland. As a global employer, we hired 1,700+ Amneal Employees in 2021, and global turnover of those employees was approximately 19%. 

Diversity is essential to Amneal’s success. It starts at the top, with five out of ten of our executives identifying as diverse by race, ethnicity, or gender, and permeates through the organization of Amneal Employees. Women represented 19% of our global workforce of Amneal Employees. In the United States, women represented 39% of our workforce and held 27% of leadership roles at the level of Director and above for Amneal Employees. Approximately 69% of our U.S. workforce of Amneal Employees identified as diverse by race or ethnicity. 
Programs for Amneal Employees
Workplace Safety and Employee Wellbeing During COVID-19 
To ensure the health and safety of both our employees and patients, we mobilized a strategic task force of top leaders to guide our COVID-19 preparedness and response. We immediately prioritized employee health, safety, and wellbeing through quick and diligent planning, the implementation of extensive health and safety protocols aligned with CDC and WHO guidelines, enhanced employee benefits, and remote/alternate work arrangements where possible. We continued operating with firm commitments to social distancing and appropriate personal protective equipment. We also continued conducting thermo-screenings at facility entrances, conducting contact tracing, and operating under well-defined universal cleaning protocols for prevention and mitigation. 
The Company’s focus on employee wellness was amplified in 2021 and exemplified by the launch of the AmWell Program, powered by Virgin Pulse, encompassing free access to four applications that cover expanded financial wellness, nutrition, fitness, and mental wellbeing content along with an incentive program to inspire participation by offering financial rewards and prizes. 
Culture
Our “Rise, Lead, Succeed” culture is central to uniting our global team and serving as a dynamic framework for driving, celebrating and rewarding individual and team performance. Every day, we foster an environment that encourages colleagues to bring their best selves to work and be actively engaged, offer new ideas, and deliver real results. Permeating our culture and day-to-day business operations is a steadfast commitment to ethics and compliance, which is guided by our Code of Conduct and championed by our executive management team.
Total Rewards
Our Total Rewards programs are industry competitive and designed to attract and retain the best and brightest talent. At the heart of our Total Rewards commitment is a broad, flexible and competitive benefits program that enables employees to choose the plans and coverage that meet their personal needs. 
These robust programs, which vary by country, include basic and supplemental health and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, access to a personal health advocate, paid parental leave for birth, adoption or foster placement, family leave, employee assistance programs, travel assistance, tuition reimbursement assistance and retirement savings plans. 
Our compensation program includes competitive base salaries, annual cash performance-based incentives and equity-based long-term incentive awards for eligible employees. Together, these programs play a key role in attracting and retaining key talent as well as rewarding performance and achievement.
Talent Development, Growth and Recognition 
We groom employees to continuously elevate their careers by offering opportunities to expand skills through robust experiences, organizational mentoring and a continuously evolving Learning and Development platform. In 2021, we launched the Amneal Leadership Lab program to 200 senior and mid-level leaders to bolster social awareness and better prepare leaders to navigate the modern challenges and opportunities of our time. The Amneal Leadership Lab program curriculum included sessions on the following topics: Growth Mindset, Psychological Safety, Building Trust, Effective Decisions, Winning Collaborations, Communicating with Presence, Direct Conversation and Feedback and Leading and Embracing Change. We recognize that taking Amneal to the next level can be accelerated by upskilling all employees to think and act as leaders and requires a significant investment in our people. To help cascade Amneal Leadership Lab principles to all colleagues, we have extended our investment in people through the company-wide launch of LinkedIn Learning. The platform provides custom-curated learning paths enabling all colleagues to engage in individual and organization-wide leadership growth curricula. 

We strongly believe that encouragement and recognition of employee success is pivotal to inspiring an engaged and high-performing culture. In 2021, over 4,400 colleagues were recognized by their peers via Amneal Applause, our company’s online and on-the-spot rewards and recognition program. We also launched our global CEO Awards program which recognized a select group of employees for rising well above and beyond their regular job duties to advance Amneal’s success. 70+ nominations were submitted and 12 winners were selected by the Executive Leadership Team and selection committee. 
Driving Impact through Corporate Responsibility 
Prioritizing sustainability is essential to keeping Amneal resilient and able to meet future challenges and opportunities effectively and has been embedded in Amneal’s mission to make healthy possible by delivering affordable essential medicines since its founding. 
At the start of 2021, the Company committed to building a formal environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) framework as one of our corporate goals. As part of that commitment, we established an ESG function to guide our ESG programs and ongoing reporting, published our inaugural Corporate Social Responsibility report highlighting six key areas of focus (Company, People, Products, Governance, Planet and Impact), and added ESG oversight into our Nominating and Governance Committee charter. 
We are engaged in giving back and encourage employees to actively support the vitality of our communities through various company-sponsored social and environmental impact opportunities including advocacy, employee volunteerism, fundraising and product donations. Key company commitments include ongoing product donations to longstanding partners including Americares, Dispensary of Hope, and Kingsway Charities. 
These are just some of our many human capital initiatives. Every year, we aim to review and enhance these and other programs to ensure that we are improving, staying competitive and putting our people at the center of our success.
