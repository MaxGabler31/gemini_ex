ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
 
Overview 
 
Singular Chef, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 9, 2009 and has a fiscal year end of April 30. We were a development-stage Company that intended to provide specialized step-by-step cooking tutorials through our website for monthly subscribers and on pay-per-view basis. 
 
On October 10, 2012 the Company changed the name of the Company from “Singular Chef, Inc.” to “One Clean Planet, Inc.”. The Board of Directors approved an amendment to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share to 550,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.  
 
On October 10, 2012 the Board of Directors approved an amendment to effect a forward split of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of 526.3:1 (the "Forward Stock Split").  
 
On November 26, 2014 by and amongst One Clean Planet, Inc. (CLPT”) and Kashin/Txtpay USA, Inc., a company incorporated and registered in the State of California, company number C3704841, whose registered office is at 1740 W Katella Ave Suite Q, Orange County, California 92867, USA (“Kashin”) together with TXTPAY LIMITED, a company incorporated and registered in New Zealand, company number 2273279, whose registered office is at C/-4 Blake Street, Surfdale, Waiheke Island, New Zealand (“Txtpay” together with Kashin, “Kashin/Txtpay”) CLPT and Kashin/Txtpay, collectively referred to as the “Parties” (the “Agreement”) whereby Kashin/Txtpay shall sell, convey, transfer, assign, and deliver to CLPT, and CLPT shall purchase from Kashin/Txtpay, 100% of the business of Kashin/Txtpay and any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates. 
 
In exchange, CLPT was to issue to the Kashin/Txtpay Shareholders, their designees or assigns, 10,000,000 shares of our common stock or 50% of the shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding after the Closing as per the terms set forth in the Agreement. 
 
The Board of Directors conducted a review of the Material Definitive Agreement (“MDA”) between the Issuer and Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand as to the validity and the compliance of the terms of such MDA by Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand and its principles. Management believes there were misrepresentations made by the principles of Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand, therefore the value of the New Zealand division is not confirmed. As a result, Management will not be issuing 10,000,000 post consolidation shares to Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand shareholders. 
 
On June 26 th 2015, the directors resolved to change the Company name to Kashin, Inc., to reduce the authorized capital to 75,000,000 shares and effect a reverse stock split of 1:35. The name change/reverse split took effect at the open of business 7/27/2015. 
 
We are unable to complete our business plan or marketing efforts because we didn’t have enough money, we ceased our development and/or marketing activities until we raise money. We had no activity from 2015 to current. We are currently bringing our company filings current to allow a reverse merger of a viable corporation to ensure our investors do not lose their entire investment.
 
Plan of Operation 
 
Over the next twelve months, the Company will be focusing on the implementation of obtaining new avenues of revenue with Kashin, Inc. / Kashin USA, Inc. At this time, we are currently seeking new revenue sources.

BUSINESS OF KASHIN
 
Overview 
 
Kashin, Inc. fka One Clean Planet , Singular Chef, Inc. ("the Company", “our” or "we") was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on April 09, 2009. We have not had any significant development of our business nor have we received any revenue. Due to the lack of results in our attempt to implement our original business plan, management determined it was in the best interests of the shareholders to look for other potential business opportunities that might be available to the Company.  
 
In 2014, the company rebranded its name to Kashin (trademarked) and established operations in USA and Africa (Uganda & Kenya). During 2014, Kashin has connected its billing platform to VOIP systems and now provides low cost international calls from any mobile to any country (branded Kashin Kredits). Kashin Kredits is now connected to major Telco’s providing mobile money services in Africa (MTN Uganda, Airtel Uganda, MTN Kenya and MPESA Kenya). Kashin is currently in the process of connecting to PayNearMe services, which will provide 20,000 stores for customers to use cash to top-up their Kashin mobile wallets for instant purchases of goods & services globally. Kashin has since engaged with several other service providers on an international level to allow Kashin Remote Top ups of minutes. 
 
In Dec 2014, Kashin merged with One Clean Planet, Inc. a public company in which Kashin Inc. will become the surviving entity. 
 
April 30, 2021, Kashin has been a dormant company since 2014 and is now considered a Shell Company.

Management believes that if additional subsequent private placements are successful, we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. 
 
If One Clean Planet is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be very difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering described herein and failure thereof would result in One Clean Planet having to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because One Clean Planet is a development stage company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If One Clean Planet cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing, it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in One Clean Planet’s common stock would lose all of their investment. 
 
Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. 
 
We do not expect to be purchasing or selling plant or significant equipment during the next twelve months.
