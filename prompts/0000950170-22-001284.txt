Item 1. Business
 Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of novel products for the treatment of serious rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. We target diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are typically no approved therapies treating the underlying disease.
The patients we seek to treat have diseases with limited or no treatment options, and we recognize that their lives and well-being are dependent upon our efforts to develop new therapies. For this reason, we are passionate about developing these therapies with the utmost urgency and care.
We were founded in April 2010 by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., and we have since assembled an experienced team with extensive rare disease drug development and commercialization capabilities.
Our Strategy
The critical components of our business strategy include the following:
•Focus on rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases with significant unmet medical need and clear biology. There are numerous rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases that currently have no drug therapy approved that treat the underlying disease. Patients suffering from these diseases often have a significant morbidity and/or mortality. We focus on developing and commercializing therapies for multiple such indications with the utmost urgency. We also focus on diseases that have biology that is well understood. We believe that developing drugs that directly impact known disease pathways will increase the probability of success of our development programs. Our modalities of biologics, small molecules, gene therapy, and nucleic acids provide us with what we believe is an optimal set of options to treat genetic diseases by selecting the best treatment strategy available for each disease. 
 •In-license promising product candidates; retain global commercialization rights to product candidates. Our current product candidates are generally in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. We believe parties agree to license product candidates to us because they are confident in our team’s expertise in rare disease drug development and commercialization. We generally intend to retain global commercialization rights to our products and product candidates whenever possible to maximize the potential value of our product portfolio. 
 •Focus on excellent, rapid, and efficient clinical and regulatory execution on multiple programs in parallel. We believe that building a successful and sustainable rare disease-focused company requires very specific expertise in the areas of patient identification, clinical study design and conduct, and regulatory strategy. Because rare disease programs involve fewer patients and may have accelerated paths to market, we are able to feasibly develop multiple clinical-stage product candidates in parallel, resulting in a more diversified portfolio that provides multiple opportunities to create value, with some economies of scale.
 •Commercialize through patient-focused global organization. We seek to commercialize our products throughout the developed world, in North America, the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Latin America, Turkey, Asia, and select international markets. We have established our own commercial organization in these markets and a network of third-party distributors in smaller markets, and are in the process of establishing our own commercial organization in Japan. We believe our commercial organization is highly specialized and focused, due to the nature of rare disease treatment. Our commercial expansion outside of the United States (U.S.) is enabled through strategic collaborations and internal pipeline development.
Approved Products and Clinical Product Candidates
 Our current approved therapies and clinical-stage pipeline consist of four product categories: biologics, small molecules, gene therapy, and nucleic acid product candidates.
We have four commercially approved products, Crysvita® (burosumab) for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia, or XLH, and tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO, Mepsevii® (vestronidase alfa) for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis VII, or MPSVII or Sly Syndrome, Dojolvi® (triheptanoin) for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or LC-FAOD, and Evkeeza® (evinacumab) for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and we anticipate having six product candidates in the clinical pipeline in 2022. The following table summarizes our approved products and clinical product candidate pipeline:
Approved Products
 Crysvita for the treatment of XLH and TIO
 Crysvita is an antibody administered via subcutaneous injection that targets fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), developed for the treatment of XLH, a rare, hereditary, progressive and lifelong musculoskeletal disorder characterized by renal phosphate wasting caused by excess FGF23 production. There are approximately 48,000 patients with XLH in the developed world, including approximately 36,000 adults and 12,000 children. Crysvita is the only approved treatment that addresses the underlying cause of XLH. Crysvita is approved in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of XLH in adult and pediatric patients six months of age and older. In the European Union, or the EU, and the United Kingdom, Crysvita is approved for the treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children one year of age and older, adolescents, and adults. In Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, Crysvita is approved for treatment of XLH in adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older. We have submitted regulatory filings in various other Latin American countries.


Crysvita is also developed for the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO, a rare disease that results from typically benign tumors that produce excess levels of FGF23, which can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, bone fractures, fatigue, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness. There are cases in which resection of the tumor is not feasible or recurrence of the tumor occurs after resection. In patients for whom the tumor is inoperable, the current standard of care consists of oral phosphate and/or vitamin D replacement. There are approximately 2,000 to 4,000 patients with TIO in the developed world. Crysvita is approved in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphatemia TIO associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors that cannot be curatively resected or localized in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. We are collaborating with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or KKC (formerly Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK), and Kyowa Kirin, a wholly owned subsidiary of KKC, on the development and commercialization of Crysvita globally.
 Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Approved Products—Kyowa Hakko Kirin” for a description of our collaboration and license agreement with KKC.
 Mepsevii for the treatment of MPS VII
 Mepsevii is an intravenous, or IV, enzyme replacement therapy, developed for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII, also known as MPS VII or Sly syndrome, a rare lysosomal storage disease that often leads to multi-organ dysfunction, pervasive skeletal disease, and death. MPS VII is one of the rarest MPS disorders, affecting an estimated 200 patients in the developed world. Mepsevii is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of children and adults with MPS VII. In the EU and the United Kingdom, Mepsevii is approved under exceptional circumstances for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations of MPS VII for patients of all ages. In Italy, Mepsevii received reimbursement approval for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with MPS VII. In Brazil and Mexico, Mepsevii is approved for the treatment of MPS VII for patients of all ages.

 Dojolvi for the treatment of LC-FAOD
Dojolvi is a highly purified, synthetic, 7-carbon fatty acid triglyceride specifically designed to provide medium-chain, odd-carbon fatty acids as an energy source and metabolite replacement for people with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or LC-FAOD, which is a set of rare metabolic diseases that prevents the conversion of fat into energy and can cause low blood sugar, muscle rupture, and heart and liver disease. Dojolvi is the first FDA-approved therapy as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed LC-FAOD and the product is commercially available in the U.S. The product is also approved by Health Canada and commercially available in that country. In Brazil we have received product approval from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) and are in the process of seeking full reimbursement approval. Discussions with EU regulatory authorities related to the approval of Dojolvi are ongoing. There are approximately 8,000 to 14,000 patients in the developed world with LC-FAOD.
 Data published in February 2021 under France’s nominative Authorization for Temporary Use program, or Authorisations Temporaires d'Utilisation (ATU), of 18 pediatric and adult patients with LC-FAOD showed that Dojolvi (triheptanoin) led to reductions in LC-FAOD manifestations and was well-tolerated, with a median follow-up duration of 22 months (range 9-228 months). When comparing the year prior to treatment to the first year receiving Dojolvi, annual emergency hospital care visits decreased from a mean of 1.12 to 0.17, or an 85% reduction, and the mean number of emergency home care events decreased from 16.82 to 2.83, an 83% reduction. Similarly, the cumulative annual number of days of emergency home care was reduced from 286 in the year prior to receiving Dojolvi to 51 in the first year receiving Dojolvi, an 82% reduction. Further improvements in the cumulative annual number of days of emergency home care were seen in the second year receiving Dojolvi.

 Evkeeza for the treatment of HoFH
On January 7, 2022, we announced a collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Regeneron) to commercialize Evkeeza outside of the U.S. Evkeeza is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the function of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), a protein that plays a key role in lipid metabolism. Evkeeza is the first and only approved therapy for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH, a rare inherited condition. HoFH occurs when two copies of the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)-causing genes are inherited, one from each parent, resulting in dangerously high levels (>400 mg/dL) of LDL-C, or bad cholesterol. Patients with HoFH are at risk for premature atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events as early as their teenage years. Evkeeza is approved in the U.S. and the European Economic Area (EEA) as a first-in-class therapy for use together with diet and other low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with HoFH.
Under the terms of the agreement, Regeneron received a $30.0 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $63.0 million in potential regulatory and sales milestones. We received the rights to develop, commercialize and distribute the product in countries outside of the U.S. and will make payments to Regeneron based on net sales of the product. There are approximately 1,600

patients in the EEA and a total of 3,000 to 5,000 patients in the territories where we have product rights. We will also share in certain costs for global trials led by Regeneron and will have the right to opt into other potential indications.
 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with Regeneron, we were also granted an exclusive right to negotiate a separate agreement with Regeneron to collaborate on the development and commercialization outside of the U.S. of Regeneron's investigational antibody, currently in Phase 2/3 development, for the treatment of the ultra-rare disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) under terms to be agreed upon by both companies.

 Clinical Product Candidates
 DTX401 for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type Ia, or GSDIa
 DTX401 is an adeno-associated virus 8, or AAV8, gene therapy clinical candidate for the treatment of patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia, or GSDIa, a disease that arises from a defect in G6Pase, an essential enzyme in glycogen and glucose metabolism. Hypoglycemia in patients with GSDIa can be life-threatening, and the accumulation of the complex sugar glycogen in certain organs and tissues can impair the ability of these tissues to function normally. If chronically untreated, patients can develop severe lactic acidosis, progress to renal failure, and potentially die in infancy or childhood. There are no approved pharmacologic therapies. GSDIa is the most common genetically inherited glycogen storage disease, with an estimated 6,000 patients in the developed world affected by GSDIa. DTX401 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in both the U.S. and in the EU and the United Kingdom, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and Fast Track designation in the U.S.
 Throughout 2021 we shared updated longer-term safety, efficacy, and durability data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study through press releases and presentations at various medical congresses. Most recently, we announced data at the 14th International Congress of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ICIEM) that took place in November 2021. Across all 12 patients in the Phase 1/2 study, the mean reduction in daily cornstarch intake was 69.9% (p < 0.0001) ranging from 19-100% when comparing baseline to the most recent visit. The nine patients in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 continued to demonstrate improved glucose control while tapering or discontinuing oral glucose replacement therapy with cornstarch up to three years after receiving DTX401. The three patients in Cohort 4 had completed a tapering prophylactic steroid regimen. Two of the three patients have reduced the frequency of daily oral glucose replacement therapy from six times per day at baseline to one (Patient 10) and two (Patient 11) times per day as of the announcement. These reductions in cornstarch dosing have had an impact on energy metabolism and body weight. As of the last visit, patients had an average weight decrease of 5.2% with a range of a 14.4% decrease to 3.1% increase. The notable weight loss was attributed to improved glycemic control and potentially increased physical activity reported by patients.
 At the 14th ICIEM in November 2021, we also presented data demonstrating that in Cohorts 3 and 4, data collected from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) indicated that glycemic control was maintained and even improved despite the reductions in cornstarch dependence. In Cohort 3, the average cornstarch intake was reduced by 64% during Weeks 49 to 52 compared with Weeks 1 to 4, while the time in euglycemia (60-120 mg/dL) increased by 14% over the same time period. In Cohort 4, the average cornstarch intake was reduced by 73% at Weeks 33 to 36 compared with Weeks -1 to -4, while the time in euglycemia decreased by 3% over the same time period.
 All three patients in a fourth and final Phase 1/2 cohort, which utilized prophylactic steroids, have been dosed at the same dose as Cohorts 2 and 3. As of February 14, 2022, across all patients in the Phase 1/2 study, there have been no infusion-related adverse events, no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no dose-limiting toxicities reported.
 The first patients have been dosed in the Phase 3 study of DTX401 following an approximate 4- to 8-week baseline screening period. The Phase 3 study has a 48-week primary efficacy analysis period and we plan to enroll approximately 50 patients eight years of age and older, randomized 1:1 to DTX401 (1.0 x 10^13 GC/kg dose) or placebo. The primary endpoint is the reduction in oral glucose replacement with cornstarch while maintaining glucose control.

 DTX301 for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase, or OTC, deficiency 
 DTX301 is an AAV8 gene therapy product candidate designed for the treatment of patients with ornithine transcarbamylase, or OTC, deficiency. OTC is part of the urea cycle, an enzymatic pathway in the liver that converts excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, to urea for excretion. OTC deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder and leads to increased levels of ammonia. Patients with OTC deficiency suffer from acute hyperammonemic episodes that can lead to hospitalization, adverse cognitive and neurological effects, and death. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 patients in the developed world with OTC deficiency, of which we estimate approximately 80% are classified as late-onset, our target population. DTX301 has received Orphan Drug Designation in both the U.S. and in the EU and the United Kingdom and Fast Track Designation in the U.S.
 Throughout 2021, we shared updated longer-term safety, efficacy, and durability data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study through press releases and presentations at various medical congresses. Most recently, we announced at the 14th ICIEM that took place in

November 2021, that the six patients who had previously responded to DTX-301 remained clinically and metabolically stable up to four years after dosing and one responder was recently identified in the prophylactic steroid cohort. The three complete responders were stable through 104, 156, and 182-weeks post-treatment with good ammonia control despite discontinuation of their alternative pathway medications and protein-restricted diets. The four other responders also remained stable through Weeks 36, 91, 104, 156, and were either continuing to taper medications and diet. As of February 14, 2022, across all responders, there have been no significant adverse events or hospitalizations related to OTC deficiency reported.
 We are currently in the process of initiating a Phase 3 study that will include a 64-week primary efficacy analysis period and plan to enroll approximately 50 patients 12 years of age and older, randomized 1:1 to DTX301 (1.7 x 10^13 GC/kg dose) or placebo. The co-primary endpoints are the percentage of patients who achieve a response as measured by discontinuation or reduction in baseline disease management and the 24-hour plasma ammonia levels. The first patients in the U.S. are expected to enter an approximate 4-to 8-week baseline screening period in the first half of 2022, after which they are expected to receive a single dose of DTX301 or placebo.

 UX143 (setrusumab) for the treatment of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), in collaboration with Mereo BioPharma 3 Limited, or Mereo
 UX143 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a protein that acts on a key bone-signaling pathway and inhibits the activity of bone-forming cells. By blocking inhibitory effects of sclerostin, the anti-sclerostin antibody causes new bone formation, increased production of collagen, and increased bone mineral density and strength. Sclerostin inhibition also reduces excessive bone resorption, further enhancing the impact on bone density. Setrusumab has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA, rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA, and was accepted into the EMA’s Priority Medicines program (PRIME). OI is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by fragile bones and reduced bone mass resulting in bones that break easily, loose joints, and weakened teeth. In severe cases, those with OI may experience hundreds of fractures in a lifetime. In addition, people with OI often suffer muscle weakness, early hearing loss, fatigue, curved bones, scoliosis, respiratory problems, and short stature, leading to significant effects on overall health and quality of life. The majority of cases of OI (estimated at approximately 90%) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type I collagen, a key component of healthy bone. Current treatment of OI is supportive, focusing on minimizing fractures and maximizing mobility, but to date, there are no FDA or EU approved treatments. There are an estimated 60,000 patients in the developed world affected by OI.
 In October 2021, at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) annual meeting, we, along with our partner, Mereo, presented additional secondary endpoint data from the Phase 2b ASTEROID study demonstrating that treatment with UX143 resulted in dose-dependent increase in P1NP serum levels, a marker of bone formation, and a decrease in CTx serum levels, a marker of bone resorption, confirming the mechanism of action of sclerostin inhibition over the 12-month treatment period. Observed improvements in bone mineral density were continuous over the 12 months of the study, with comparable gains achieved in the first and second six months of treatment in the high dose group despite temporal changes in biomarkers.
 We currently expect to start a pediatric and young adult Phase 2/3 study in the first half of 2022. The objective of the Phase 2/3 study will first focus on determining the optimal dose based on increases in collagen production using serum P1NP levels and an acceptable safety profile. Following determination of the dose, we currently intend to adapt the study into a pivotal Phase 3 stage, evaluating fracture reduction over an estimated 15 to 24 months as the primary endpoint, subject to regulatory review. We currently expect a separate Phase 2 study of patients under age five with OI to start in the second half of 2022. We will, also, continue to evaluate adult patients who were previously treated in the ASTEROID study.

 GTX-102 for the treatment of Angelman Syndrome, partnered with GeneTx
 GTX-102 is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, that is being developed for the treatment of Angelman syndrome, a debilitating and rare neurogenetic disorder caused by loss-of-function of the maternally inherited allele of the UBE3A gene. There are an estimated 60,000 patients in the developed world affected by Angelman syndrome. GTX-102 was granted Fast Track designation, Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. GTX-102 is being developed in collaboration with GeneTx Biotherapeutics LLC (GeneTx).


In 2020, we, along with our partner GeneTx, announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalating study (GTX-102-001) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of GTX-102 in pediatric patients with Angelman syndrome. Five patients received GTX-102 treatment and signs of clinical improvement in multiple domains of Angelman syndrome were reported early in dosing. After the fifth patient was dosed, the patient experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of lower extremity weakness and the companies paused enrollment and dosing in the study. Subsequently, similar SAEs of lower extremity weakness were reported in the other four patients following treatment at the highest doses. The SAEs were assessed as mild or moderate in severity, improved over a period of a few weeks and all have been fully resolved. Full safety information was submitted to the FDA. A formal clinical hold was issued by the FDA on study GTX-102-001 during the fourth quarter of 2020, which was subsequently removed by the FDA in 2021, as described below.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, along with our partner GeneTx, we announced positive interim preliminary data from study GTX-102-001 which indicated substantial improvements in all patients in at least two disease domains including communication, behavior, sleep, gross motor function, and fine motor function as measured by the CGI-I-AS for Patients 1 through 4 at day 128, and Patient 5 at Day 86. These improvements were also supported by other scores, including the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-4), where multiple patients improved on receptive or expressive communication sub-scales.
 In the second quarter of 2021, we and our partner GeneTx announced that Health Canada (HC) cleared a protocol amendment and the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to begin treatment of patients in Canada and the U.K. with Angelman syndrome.
 In September 2021, we, and our partner GeneTx announced that the FDA removed the clinical hold and that GeneTx could begin dosing naïve patients in the Phase 1/2 study of GTX-102 in pediatric patients with Angelman syndrome.
 Under the amended U.S. protocol, eight patients (4 to < 8 years of age) who were not previously treated with GTX-102 will be enrolled into two groups, an active group and an age-matched comparator group. The active group will receive four monthly 2 mg doses of GTX-102, while the comparator group will have limited assessments at baseline and at Day 128. Patients in the comparator group will then be eligible to receive GTX-102 under the same dosing strategy as the active group. All U.S. patients who have completed the dose-loading phase will then move to a maintenance phase during which they will receive 2 mg of GTX-102 every three months and continue to be monitored for response and safety.
 Under the protocol approved in the U.K. and Canada, approximately 12 patients will be enrolled into two cohorts split by age: patients ages 4 to < 8 years will be enrolled into Cohort 4, and patients ages 8 to < 18 years will be enrolled into Cohort 5. Two patients in the younger cohort and two patients in the older cohort will be enrolled first and assessed after two doses by a data safety monitoring board. If recommended, then an additional four patients can be enrolled in each of the two cohorts.
The starting doses in Cohorts 4 and 5 will be 3.3 and 5 mg, respectively. Patients will receive three to four monthly doses, titrated individually through smaller steps than the first three cohorts in the original study with dose increases based on response and enhanced safety monitoring. Patients will then move to a maintenance phase during which they will receive GTX-102 every three months and continue to be monitored for response and safety. In this phase, individual dose titration may continue if safety is sustained, and the clinical response is not much improved in at least 2 domains up to a maximum dose of 14 mg.
 In October 2021, we announced that the first patients under the amended protocol in Canada and the U.K. were dosed in the Phase 1/2 study.
 In January 2022, we provided an initial update on the first four patients treated in Canada and the U.K. As of the update, all four patients had received multiple doses of GTX-102 with no treatment-related serious adverse events of any type nor adverse events related to lower extremity weakness. As of January 2022, three patients had received a preliminary assessment of clinical response and all have shown early signs of clinical activity. The data safety monitoring board (DSMB) for Cohort 4 recommended dose escalation for the first two patients and enrollment of the additional four patients in this cohort. Later in January 2022, the DSMB for Cohort 5 met and also recommended dose escalation and expansion of that cohort.
As of February 14, 2022, patients naïve to prior treatment with GTX-102 have been screened in the U.S. and dosing has begun. We currently anticipate data on full Cohorts 4 and 5 in Canada and the U.K., as well as available safety and efficacy data from the patients treated in the U.S. in mid-2022.

 UX701 for the treatment of Wilson Disease
 UX701 is an investigational AAV type 9 gene therapy designed to deliver stable expression of a truncated version of the ATP7B copper transporter following a single intravenous infusion. It has been shown in preclinical studies to improve copper distribution and excretion from the body and reverse pathological findings of Wilson liver disease. UX701 was granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and EU. Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which results in deficient production of ATP7B, a protein that transports copper. Loss of function of this copper-binding protein results in the accumulation of copper in the liver and other tissues, most notably the central nervous system. Patients with Wilson disease experience hepatic, neurologic and/or psychiatric problems. Those with liver disease can experience such symptoms as fatigue, lack of appetite,

abdominal pain and jaundice, and can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, life-threatening liver failure and death. Wilson disease can be treated by reducing copper absorption or removing excess copper from the body using life-long chelation therapy, but unmet needs exist because some treated patients experience clinical deterioration and severe side effects. Wilson disease affects more than 50,000 individuals in the developed world.
UX701 has received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA. This allows for early and frequent communication throughout the entire drug development and review process and reflects the serious, unmet need for patients with Wilson disease.
In October 2021, we announced that we had begun screening and enrolling patients with Wilson disease into the 6- to 12-week baseline monitoring period prior to dosing in the seamless Phase 1/2/3 study of UX701, or the Cyprus2+ study. The study will enroll patients receiving ongoing standard of care medication for the treatment of Wilson disease (copper chelators and/or zinc) for at least 12 months, with no medication or dose changes for at least six months prior to enrollment. After initial screening, which includes testing for pre-existing antibodies to the AAV9 capsid, patients will be evaluated to ensure stable measures of disease during a 6-to 12-week baseline monitoring period (including values for 24-hour urinary copper concentration, complete blood count, and liver function tests) and patients will then be dosed with either UX701 or placebo.
During the first stage of the study, the safety and efficacy of up to three dose levels of UX701 will be evaluated over the course of 52 weeks and a dose will be selected for further evaluation in stage 2. In this first stage, 27 patients will be randomized into three cohorts in a 2:1 ratio per cohort to receive UX701 at the dose level assigned for the cohort or a placebo. The sequential doses to be evaluated are 5.0 x 10^12 GC/kg, 1.0 x 10^13 GC/kg, and 2.0 x 10^13 GC/kg. In stage 2, a new cohort of patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive the selected dose of UX701 or placebo. The primary safety and efficacy analyses will be conducted at Week 52 of stage 2. The primary efficacy endpoints are change in 24-hour urinary copper concentration and percent reduction in standard of care medication by Week 52. After the initial 52-week study period, all patients will receive long term follow up in stage 3. Patients randomized to placebo in stages 1 and 2 will become eligible to receive UX701 in stage 3.

 UX053 for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type III, or GSDIII
UX053 is being developed for the treatment of GSDIII, a disease caused by a glycogen debranching enzyme (AGL) deficiency that results in glycogen accumulation in the liver and muscle. GSDIII can cause hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, some progressive liver cirrhosis, and muscle disease later in life, and affects more than 10,000 patients in the developed world. UX053 is our first mRNA program to enter clinical studies. UX053 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA in June 2021 and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July 2021, highlighting the significant unmet need for patients with GSDIII.
 Dosing in a Phase 1/2 study of UX053 for the treatment of GSDIII began in December 2021. Part 1 of the study is open label with single-ascending doses. Part 2 is double-blind and will evaluate repeat doses at escalating levels. We currently expect preliminary data from Part 1 of the study and to initiate Part 2 of the study in the second half of 2022.

 Competition
 In the case of indications that we are targeting, it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat these diseases.
With respect to Crysvita, although we are not aware of any other products currently in clinical development for the treatment of XLH and TIO, it is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches such as gene therapy, to treat XLH and TIO. Most pediatric patients with XLH are managed using oral phosphate replacement and/or vitamin D therapy, which is relatively inexpensive and therefore may adversely affect our ability to commercialize Crysvita, if approved, in some countries.
With respect to Mepsevii, we are not aware of any other compounds currently in clinical development for MPS VII, but it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat this disease. Additionally, gene therapy and other therapeutic approaches may emerge for the treatment of lysosomal diseases. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants have also been used in MPS VII and in other lysosomal storage diseases and represent a potential competing therapy. Stem cell transplants have been effective in treating soft tissue storage and in having an impact on brain disease, but have not to date proven effective in treating bone and connective tissue disease. Typically, enzyme replacement therapy has had an impact on bone and connective tissue disease in other disorders when patients were treated early.

With respect to Dojolvi, although we are not aware of any other compounds currently in clinical development for LC-FAOD, LC-FAOD is commonly treated with diet therapy and MCT oil. Dojolvi may compete with this approach. Although we believe that Dojolvi should be considered a drug and will be regulated that way, it is possible that other companies or individuals may attempt to produce triheptanoin for use in LC-FAOD. Investigators are testing triheptanoin in clinical studies across multiple indications, including LC-FAOD. It is also possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize other medium odd-chain fatty acids, or completely different compounds, to treat LC-FAOD. Other companies may also utilize other approaches, such as gene therapy, to treat LC-FAOD. In addition, Reneo Pharmaceuticals is developing REN001, a PPAR delta agonist, in Phase 1b for LC-FAOD and other genetic myopathies.
 With respect to DTX401, there are currently no pharmacologic treatments for patients with GSDIa and we are not aware of any programs in clinical development.
With respect to DTX301, the current treatments for patients with OTC deficiency are nitrogen scavenging drugs and severe limitations in dietary protein. Drug therapy includes sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl) and glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti), both nitrogen scavengers that help eliminate excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, by facilitating its excretion. A novel formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate, ACER-001 has been submitted for approval by Acer Therapeutics and has a target PDUFA date of June 5, 2022. During a metabolic crisis, patients routinely receive carbohydrate and lipid rich nutrition, including overnight feeding through a nasogastric tube, to limit bodily protein breakdown and ammonia production. In acute cases, ammonia must be removed by dialysis or hemofiltration. Liver transplant may also be a solution for OTC deficiency. In addition, Kaleido Biosciences is developing KB195, a synthetic glycan, in Phase 2 for urea cycle disorders, including OTC deficiency, and Arcturus Therapeutics is developing ARCT-810, a messenger RNA therapy, in Phase 1b for OTC deficiency.
With respect to GTX-102, there are currently no approved drugs for Angelman syndrome. Many patients take general treatments to try to manage specific symptoms, such as seizures or sleep disturbances, but there are no treatments available that address the underlying biology of the disease. We are aware of other ASOs in preclinical and clinical development for Angelman syndrome, including a program from Roche in a Phase 1 study, as well as preclinical gene therapy programs. In addition, Neuren Pharmaceuticals is developing NNZ-2591, an IGF-1 analog, in Phase 2 for Angelman syndrome.
 With respect to UX701, there are no currently approved treatments that address the underlying cause of Wilson disease. Many patients are on chelator therapies, but these fail to address the mutated ATP7B copper transporter gene. We are aware of another gene therapy, VTX-801, that is in preclinical development by Vivet Therapeutics, in collaboration with Pfizer, for Wilson disease.
With respect to UX143, there are currently no approved drugs for osteogenesis imperfecta. Most pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta are managed with off-label use of bisphosphonates to increase bone density and reduce frequency of bone fracture. We are aware of another anti-sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, that is in Phase 1 clinical testing by Amgen. In addition, fresolimumab, an anti-TGFβ antibody, is in Phase 1 clinical testing led by a Baylor College of Medicine investigator in collaboration with Sanofi-Genzyme.
 With respect to UX053, there are currently no pharmacologic treatments for patients with GSD III and we are not aware of any programs in clinical development.
 License and Collaboration Agreements
Our products and some of our current product candidates have been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Following is a description of our significant license and collaboration agreements.
Approved Products
 Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.
 In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with KKC. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, as amended, we and KKC currently collaborate on the development and commercialization of Crysvita in the field of orphan diseases in the U.S. and Canada, or the “profit-share territory”, and in the EU, U.K., and Switzerland, or the European territory, and we have the right to develop and commercialize such products in the field of orphan diseases in Mexico and Central and South America, or Latin America. In the field of orphan diseases, and except for ongoing studies being conducted by KKC, we are the lead party for development activities in the profit-share territory and in the European territory until the applicable transition date. We share the costs for development activities in the profit-share territory and European territory conducted pursuant to the development plan before the applicable transition date equally with KKC. In April 2023, which is the transition date for the profit-share territory, and following the applicable transition date for the European territory, KKC will become the lead party and be responsible for the costs of the development activities. However, we will continue to share the costs of the studies commenced prior to the applicable transition date equally with KKC. Crysvita was approved in the EU and U.K. in February 2018 and was approved by the FDA in April 2018. As described below, we and KKC share commercial responsibilities and profits in the profit-share territory until April 2023, KKC has the commercial responsibility in the European territory, and we are responsible for commercializing burosumab in Latin America.

In the profit-share territory, KKC books sales of products and we have the sole right to promote the products, with KKC having the right to increasingly participate in the promotion of the products until the transition date of April 2023, which is five years from commercial launch. After April 2023, KKC will have the right to promote the products, subject to a limited promotion right retained by us. See “Item I.A. Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks related to the expiration of our exclusive right to promote Crysvita in the profit-share territory. In the European territory, KKC books sales of products and has the sole right to promote and sell the products, with the exception of Turkey. In Turkey, we have rights to commercialize Crysvita and KKC has the option to assume responsibility for such commercialization efforts, after a certain minimum period. In Latin America, we book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products.
KKC manufactures and supplies all quantities of product for clinical studies. KKC also supplies all quantities of product for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America. The supply price in the profit-share territory and Latin America is 35% of the net sales price through December 31, 2022 and 30% thereafter.
The remaining profit or loss from commercializing products in the profit-share territory is shared between us and KKC on a 50/50 basis until April 2023. Thereafter, we will be entitled to receive a tiered double-digit revenue share in the mid-to-high 20% range in the profit-share territory, intended to approximate the profit-share. KKC pays us a royalty of up to 10% based on net sales in the European territory. We sold our interest in the European territory royalty to Royalty Pharma in December 2019. In Latin America, we pay to KKC a low single-digit royalty on net sales. Our and KKC’s obligations to pay royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis for so long as we or KKC, as applicable, are selling products in such country.
The collaboration and license agreement will continue for as long as products in the field of orphan diseases are sold in the profit-share territory, European territory, Turkey, or Latin America, unless the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
KKC may terminate the agreement in certain countries or territories based upon our failure to meet certain milestones. Furthermore, either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. In any event of termination by KKC, unless such termination is the result of KKC’s termination for certain types of breach of the agreement by us, we may receive low single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net post-termination sales by KKC in one or more countries or territories, the amount of which varies depending on the timing of, and reason for, such termination. In any event of termination, our rights to Crysvita under the agreement and our obligations to share development costs will cease, and the program will revert to KKC, worldwide if the agreement is terminated as a whole or solely in the terminated countries if the agreement is terminated solely with respect to certain countries.
Saint Louis University
In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Saint Louis University, or SLU, wherein SLU granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to Mepsevii. Under the terms of the license agreement, SLU granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell therapeutics related to SLU’s beta-glucuronidase product for use in the treatment of human diseases.
Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay to SLU a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products in the U.S., Europe, or Japan, subject to certain potential deductions. Our obligation to pay royalties to SLU in these territories continues until the expiration of any orphan drug exclusivity. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and SLU may terminate the agreement for our material breach, bankruptcy, or challenge of the licensed technology, and SLU may terminate the agreement or render our license non-exclusive if we fail to meet our diligence obligations. Unless terminated as set forth above, this license agreement continues in full force and effect until the latest expiration of any orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S., Europe, or Japan, at which point our license becomes fully paid.
 Baylor Research Institute
In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended, with Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, under which we exclusively licensed certain intellectual property related to Dojolvi. The license includes patents, patent applications, know-how, and intellectual property related to the composition and formulation of Dojolvi as well as its use in treating a number of orphan diseases, including LC-FAOD. The license grant includes the sole right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize licensed products for all human and animal uses. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in select orphan indications. If we fail to meet our diligence obligations with respect to a specified orphan indication or set of orphan indications, BRI may convert our license to a non-exclusive license with respect to such orphan indication or set of orphan indications until we receive regulatory approval for licensed products in the applicable orphan indication or set of orphan indications.
We are also obligated to pay a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales to BRI, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Our obligation to pay royalties to BRI continues on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the first regulatory exclusivity granted with respect to such product in such country or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, in each case in connection with approval in such country for LC-FAOD or an orphan disease covered by our license from BRI. We may make future payments of up to $2.5 million contingent upon attainment of certain development milestones and $7.5 million if certain sales milestones are achieved.

We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either we or BRI may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. If we terminate for BRI’s breach or bankruptcy, our license from BRI will remain in effect, subject to our continued payment of reduced milestones and royalties. Unless terminated by its terms, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until our royalty obligations expire, at which point our license from BRI with respect to such product in such country becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid and royalty-free.
 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
 On January 7, 2022, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, or Regeneron, to clinically develop, commercialize, and distribute Evkeeza for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) outside of the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, Regeneron received a $30.0 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $63.0 million in future milestone payments, contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones. We received the rights to develop, commercialize and distribute the product in countries outside of the U.S. and will make payments to Regeneron based on net sales of the product. We will share in certain costs for global trials led by Regeneron and also have the right to opt into other potential indications.
 We were also granted an exclusive right to negotiate a separate agreement with Regeneron to collaborate on the development and commercialization outside of the U.S. of Regeneron's investigational antibody, currently in Phase 2/3 development, for the treatment of the ultra-rare disease FOP under terms to be agreed upon by both companies.

We are required to develop licensed products in accordance with certain milestones. In the event that we fail to meet a particular milestone within established deadlines, we can extend the relevant deadline by providing a separate payment to REGENX. The 2013 license agreement will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment, or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse, or become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world. Upon expiration, our know-how license will become non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free with respect to licensed know-how that REGENX owns in the field and will continue with respect to all of REGENX’s other know-how in the field under certain of its licenses for so long as its rights from those licensors continue. Subject to certain obligations to Bayer, we may terminate the 2013 license agreement upon prior written notice or for a material breach. REGENX may terminate the license agreement if we or our controlling affiliate become insolvent, are late in paying money due, commence certain actions relating to the licensed patents or materially breach the agreement. If the 2013 license agreement is terminated with respect to an indication, we grant certain rights to REGENX, including transferring ownership of any applicable regulatory approvals and granting an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property for use with respect to products covered by the intellectual property we had licensed from REGENX in that indication.


In March 2015, we entered into an option and license agreement with REGENX, which was subsequently amended, pursuant to which we have an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell, and offer for sale licensed products to treat Wilson disease and CDKL5 deficiency. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and our rights to enforce the in-licensed patents are subject to certain limitations. Under the 2015 option and license agreement, as amended, we pay or will pay REGENX an annual maintenance fee and certain milestone fees per disease indication, mid to high single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, and mid-single to low double-digit percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicenses for the licensed intellectual property rights. We are required to develop licensed products in accordance with certain milestones. In the event that we fail to meet a particular milestone within established deadlines, we can extend the relevant deadline by providing a separate payment to REGENX. The 2015 option and license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the royalty obligations with respect to all licensed products for all licensed indications under all licenses granted under all exercised commercial options. Upon expiration, our know-how license will become non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free with respect to licensed know-how that REGENX owns in the field and will continue with respect to all of REGENX’s other know-how in the field under certain of its licenses for so long as its rights from those licensors continue. We may terminate the 2015 option and license agreement upon prior written notice or for a material breach. REGENX may terminate the 2015 option and license agreement if we or our controlling affiliate become insolvent, are late in paying money due, commence certain actions relating to the licensed patents or materially breach the agreement.

 In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with Bayer to research, develop and commercialize AAV gene therapy products for treatment of hemophilia A, which was amended and restated in June 2019. Under this agreement, we granted Bayer an exclusive license to develop and commercialize one or more novel gene therapies for hemophilia A. We are responsible for the development of DTX201 through a proof-of-concept clinical trial, with reimbursement from Bayer for project costs. Bayer is responsible operationally, including for conducting the proof-of-concept clinical trial, and will incur the costs of the conduct of the trial. Upon the successful demonstration of clinical proof of concept, Bayer agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to manage and fund any subsequent clinical trials and commercialization of gene therapy products for treatment of hemophilia A. Bayer will have worldwide rights to commercialize the potential future product.
 Under the agreement, Bayer paid us an upfront cash payment and will pay us development and commercialization milestone payments. The agreement expires on a licensed treatment-by-licensed treatment and country-by-country basis until the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale or when patent claims have expired, lapsed, been abandoned, or been invalidated in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party. Bayer may terminate the agreement upon prior notice to us, either in its entirety or with respect to certain territories subject to the agreement. Bayer may also terminate the agreement upon notice of a product’s failure to meet certain criteria or after the successful completion of certain Phase 1 trials in the event Bayer makes a good faith determination that there is a material safety issue with respect to such product. Either party may terminate the agreement upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement if Bayer institutes certain actions. Under certain termination circumstances, we would have worldwide rights to the terminated program(s).
University of Pennsylvania
 In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with the University of Pennsylvania to sponsor certain research of Dr. Wilson at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine related to liver gene therapy and hemophilia. Under the agreement, the University of Pennsylvania granted us an option to obtain a worldwide, non-exclusive or exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patent rights conceived, created or reduced to practice in the conduct of the research. The agreement expired on December 31, 2021.

In May 2016, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with the University of Pennsylvania under which we are collaborating on the pre-clinical development of gene therapy products for the treatment of phenylketonuria and Wilson disease, each, a Subfield. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to certain patent rights arising out of the research program, and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to certain University of Pennsylvania intellectual property, in each case to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, commercialize and import licensed products in each Subfield for the term of the agreement.

We are collaborating to develop products that combine Solid’s differentiated microdystrophin construct, our Producer Cell Line (PCL) manufacturing platform, and our AAV8 variants. Solid is providing development support and was granted an exclusive option to co-invest in products we develop for profit share participation in certain territories. We also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Solid in October 2020 pursuant to which we purchased 7,825,797 shares of Solid’s common stock for an aggregate price of $40.0 million, and we currently continue to hold all of the purchased shares.
 Other
Daiichi
In March 2020, we entered into a License and Technology Access Agreement, or the License Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., or Daiichi Sankyo, pursuant to which, we granted Daiichi Sankyo a non-exclusive license to intellectual property, including know-how and patent applications, with respect to our PCL and HEK293 transient transfection manufacturing technology platforms for AAV-based gene therapy products. We retained the exclusive right to use the manufacturing technology for our current target indications and additional indications identified now and in the future. We are providing certain technical assistance and technology transfer services during the technology transfer period of three years to enable Daiichi Sankyo to use the technologies for its internal gene therapy programs. Daiichi Sankyo has an option to extend the technology transfer period including know-how improvements by two additional one-year periods by paying a fixed amount for each additional year. Daiichi Sankyo will be responsible for the manufacturing, development, and commercialization of their products manufactured with the licensed technology; however, we have the option to co-develop and co-commercialize rare disease products at the IND stage. We may also provide strategic consultation to Daiichi Sankyo on the development of both AAV-based gene therapy products and other products for rare diseases.
Under the terms of the License Agreement, Daiichi Sankyo made an upfront payment of $125.0 million and during the fourth quarter of 2021, an additional payment of $25.0 million upon achievement of the milestones related to the technology transfer of the PCL and HEK293 platforms. Daiichi Sankyo will reimburse us for all costs associated with the transfer of the manufacturing technology and will also pay us a single-digit royalties on net sales of products manufactured with the technology platforms.
 In March 2020, we also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, pursuant to which Daiichi Sankyo purchased 1,243,913 shares of our common stock in exchange for $75.0 million in cash. Daiichi Sankyo is subject to a three-year standstill and restrictions on sale of the shares (subject to customary exceptions or release).
In June 2020, we executed a subsequent license agreement, or the Sublicense Agreement, with Daiichi Sankyo for transfer of certain technology in consideration for a payment of $8.0 million and annual maintenance fees, milestone payments, and royalties on any net sales of products incorporating the licensed intellectual property.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our products, product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our products, product candidates, processes, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our products, product candidates, and processes. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technologies, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We also use other means to protect our products and product candidates, including the pursuit of marketing or data exclusivity periods, orphan drug status, and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries, including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China. See “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Biosimilars and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Patent Term Restoration,” “Government Regulation—EU Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,” and “Government Regulation—EU Regulation — New Chemical Entity Exclusivity” below for additional information.

We seek regulatory approval for our products and product candidates in disease areas with high unmet medical need, significant market potential, and where we expect to have a proprietary position through patents covering various aspects of our product candidates, such as composition, dosage, formulation, use, and manufacturing process, among others. Our success depends in part on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio by filing new patent applications, prosecuting existing applications, and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications.
Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to achieve or maintain market exclusivity or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. We also cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, product candidates, or processes. For more information, please see “Item I.A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of December 31, 2021, we own, jointly own, or have exclusive rights to more than 160 issued and in-force patents (not including individually validated national patents in European Patent Convention member countries) that cover one or more of our products or product candidates, methods of their use, or methods of their manufacture, including more than 50 in-force patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO). Furthermore, as of December 31, 2021, we own, jointly own, or have exclusive rights to more than 325 pending patent applications, including more than 50 pending U.S. applications.
With respect to our owned or in-licensed issued patents in the U.S. and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain an extension of patent term to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the U.S., this extended coverage period is known as patent term extension (PTE) and can only be obtained provided we apply for and receive a marketing authorization for a product. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. In Europe, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPC) may also be available to patents, which would be available by applying to the member states. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting marketing approval from the FDA.
The exclusivity positions for our commercial products and our clinical-stage product candidates as of December 31, 2021 are summarized below.
 Crysvita (Burosumab) Exclusivity
 We have in-licensed rights from KKC to patents and patent applications relating to Crysvita and its use for the treatment of XLH, TIO, and various other hypophosphatemic conditions. Pursuant to this license, we have rights to a number of issued patents and pending applications, including seven issued U.S. patents, as well as patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering generic and specific antibodies against FGF23 as well as their use for the treatment of XLH, TIO, and related conditions. The patent terms for the issued patents in the U.S. are from 2022 to 2035, while the issued patents outside the U.S. expire between 2023 and 2035. For patents covering the Crysvita composition of matter, KKC has applied to extend the patent term in the U.S. from 2029 to 2032 and in Europe from 2028 to 2033. In addition to the foregoing patent protections, Crysvita is protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2030 and by orphan drug exclusivity for treating XLH and TIO until 2025 and 2027, respectively.
Mepsevii (Vestronidase Alfa) Exclusivity
 We own four issued U.S. patents and the corresponding issued foreign patents covering Mepsevii and its use in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as MPS VII. These patents expire in 2035. Mepsevii is also protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2029 and by orphan drug exclusivity for treating MPS VII until 2024.
Dojolvi (Triheptanoin) Exclusivity
 We have an exclusive license from BRI to patents and patent applications relating to Dojolvi and its use for the treatment of FAOD. The in-licensed BRI patent portfolio includes issued patents in the U.S and Mexico that expire in 2025 and cover Dojolvi, as well as an issued patent in Canada that expires in 2025 and covers the use of Dojolvi for the treatment of FAOD. In the U.S., we have applied to extend the term of a BRI patent covering Dojolvi from 2025 to 2029. Beyond these BRI patents and patent applications, we own a pending U.S. patent application, corresponding foreign patent applications, and issued patents in Australia, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan relating to our pharmaceutical-grade Dojolvi composition; these owned patents and any additional patents issuing from these owned applications are expected to expire in 2034. Dojolvi is also protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2025 and orphan drug exclusivity for treating FAOD until 2027.
DTX401 (Pariglasgene Brecaparvovec) Exclusivity
 We have two in-licenses to patents and patent applications covering elements of our DTX401 product candidate. First, we have in-licensed patents owned by University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and sublicensed to us by REGENX relating to the AAV8 capsid used in DTX401 that expire between 2022 and 2024 in the U.S., and in 2022 in foreign countries. Second, we have a non-exclusive license from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to an issued U.S. patent expiring in 2034 (not accounting for any available PTE) and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications covering a recombinant nucleic acid construct used in DTX401 that includes a codon-optimized version of the G6Pase gene.
DTX301 (Avalotcagene Ontaparvovec) Exclusivity
 We have in-licensed patents and patent applications owned by UPENN relating to various adeno-associated viruses and vectors utilizing the capsids of those viruses. These patents and patent applications are licensed or sublicensed to REGENX and sublicensed to us. Our product candidate DTX301 utilizes an AAV8 capsid and a codon-optimized version of the OTC gene. The in-licensed patents relevant to the AAV8 capsid expire between 2022 and 2024 in the U.S., and in 2022 in foreign countries. Our in-license also includes two issued U.S. patents expiring in 2035 (not accounting for any available PTE) and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications covering the codon-optimized version of the OTC gene used in DTX301.
UX143 (Setrusumab) Exclusivity
 We have in-licensed rights from Mereo to patents and patent applications relating to setrusumab and its use for the treatment of OI. Pursuant to our license from Mereo, we have exclusive rights outside of Europe to a first Mereo patent family that includes three issued U.S. patents and corresponding issued foreign patents that relate to the setrusumab antibody, nucleic acids encoding setrusumab, processes for producing setrusumab, and setrusumab’s use as a medicament. Patents emanating from this first patent family expire in 2028 (not accounting for any available PTE). We also have exclusive rights outside of Europe to two additional Mereo patent families, including an issued U.S. patent expiring in 2037 (not accounting for any available PTE), relating to methods of using anti-sclerostin antibodies including setrusumab for the treatment of OI. Beyond these Mereo patents and patent applications, we jointly own with Mereo two additional patent families relating to dosing regimens for the use of anti-sclerostin antibodies including setrusumab in the treatment of OI and other bone disorders; we expect any patents emanating from these patent families to expire in 2042 (not accounting for any available PTE).
UX701 Exclusivity
We have two in-licenses to patents and patent applications covering elements of our UX701 product candidate. First, we have in-licensed patents owned by UPENN and sublicensed to us by REGENX relating to the AAV9 capsid used in UX701 that expire between 2024 and 2026 in the U.S., and in 2024 in foreign countries. Second, we have an exclusive license from UPENN to patent applications covering AAV vectors containing certain regulatory and coding sequences packaged in UX701; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2037 (not accounting for any available PTE). Beyond these UPENN patents and patent applications, we own a patent family covering AAV vectors expressing a novel truncated version of the ATP7B protein produced by UX701; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2040 (not accounting for any available PTE).
   UX053 Exclusivity
We have an in-license from Arcturus to four U.S. patents expiring between 2034 and 2038 (not accounting for any available PTE), and corresponding foreign patents and applications, that cover the cationic lipid used in our UX053 product candidate. Beyond these Arcturus patents and patent applications, we own a patent family covering the codon-optimized version of the human AGL mRNA expressed by UX053; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2038 (not accounting for any available PTE).
 Trademarks
We own registered trademarks covering the Ultragenyx word mark in the U.S. and multiple other jurisdictions. In addition, we own a registered trademark in the U.S. covering a stylized design of our Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical logo. We also own registered trademarks in the U.S. and other territories relating to our Mepsevii and Dojolvi brand names for vestronidase alfa and triheptanoin, respectively. We additionally have a license from KKC to registered trademarks covering the Crysvita brand name for burosumab in the U.S., Canada, Turkey, and various Latin American territories.
Other
We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our ownership of know-how and trade secrets through an active program of legal mechanisms including assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations, and licenses.
Manufacturing
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our products and product candidates for use in preclinical, clinical, and commercial applications. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the cGMP production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We do, however, have process and analytical development and QC lab capabilities focused on the gene therapy and nucleic acid technologies. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners has historically minimized our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. All of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales.
 While our third-party manufacturers have met our current manufacturing requirements, we are building our own GMP gene therapy manufacturing plant to seek to mitigate potential program timeline delays, control manufacturing costs and reduce manufacturing lead times. For the other non-gene therapy modalities, we primarily use third-party manufacturers to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.
Products
 Mepsevii
The Mepsevii drug substance and drug product are manufactured by Rentschler Biopharma SE, or Rentschler, under non-exclusive commercial supply and services agreements effective December 2017 and January 2018, respectively. The drug substance agreement has an initial term of five years, which will be automatically extended for another five years following the initial term, and will continue in full force and effect for its term unless earlier terminated. Following the initial term, we and Rentschler can withdraw from the agreement without cause upon prior notice for specified periods. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches a material provision of the agreement and such breach remains uncured for a specified period following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach. The drug product agreement expires on December 31, 2025 and will continue in full force and effect for its term unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the agreements with immediate effect if the other party violates or breaches certain obligations set forth in the agreement, undergoes a material change in control, or infringes its intellectual property rights. We can also terminate the agreements if Rentschler loses the right to operate under the agreement. Either party can also terminate the agreements if Rentschler is unable to deliver its agreed upon services for a certain period in the case of a force majeure event. The cell line to produce Mepsevii is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available. We are transferring the fill and finish activities for the manufacture of Mepsevii to a new site as the Rentschler manufacturing site in Laupheim, Germany is being discontinued. In preparation of this activity, we intend to maintain sufficient inventory levels as we identify an alternative supplier and transfer the fill and finish activities for Mepsevii to such supplier. See “Item IA. Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks associated with the transfer of the Mepsevii finish and fill activities to an alternative supplier.
 Crysvita
The drug substance and drug product for burosumab are made by KKC in Japan under the collaboration and license agreement with KKC. The cell line to produce burosumab is specific for this product and is in KKC’s control. All other raw materials are commercially available.
Dojolvi
The pharmaceutical-grade drug substance for Dojolvi is manufactured by IOI Oleo GmbH, or IOI Oleo, in Germany under an exclusive worldwide supply agreement, subject to certain limitations, executed in 2012 with an initial term of three years. The agreement automatically renews for two-year periods at the end of each then current term unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew in writing at least three calendar months before the expiration of the then current term. Additionally, if a party materially breaches an obligation under the agreement and does not cure such breach within 60 days of receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. The drug product for Dojolvi is manufactured by Aenova Haupt Pharma Wolfratshausen GmbH, or Haupt Pharma, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement, for the non-exclusive manufacture and supply of product. The agreement was executed in April 2019 with an initial three year term and automatically renews at the end of the current term for an indefinite period unless we provide written notice of termination to Haupt Pharma no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the initial term. After the initial term, either party may terminate the agreement without cause with at least 12 months’ notice. Additionally, if a party materially breaches certain obligations under the agreement and does not cure such breach within 30 days of receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. Either party may also terminate the agreement with immediate effect if the other party breaches certain specified obligations as set forth in the agreement.
Product Candidates
 DTX401
 The drug substance and drug product for DTX401 are manufactured on a non-exclusive basis by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, pursuant to cGMP requirements.
DTX401 is currently manufactured using HEK293 suspension mammalian cells. Similar to DTX301, HEK293 cells are widely used in the biotechnology industry and the regulatory agencies in the U.S. and EU are familiar with the technology. As the clinical program advances we may consider alternate cell manufacturing systems such as HeLa cell systems.
 DTX301
 Similar to DTX 401, the drug substance and drug product for DTX301, our AAV product candidate, are manufactured on a non-exclusive basis by a CMO, pursuant to cGMP requirements.
DTX301 is currently manufactured using HEK293 mammalian cells. HEK293 cells are straightforward to grow and transfect readily, and as a result, are widely used in the biotechnology industry to produce therapeutic proteins and viral vectors for gene therapy on a small scale. Vectors produced using HEK293 cells have been, or are being, used safely in multiple clinical trials, including trials conducted in the U.S. and EU by other biopharmaceutical companies and academic government institutions. A key advantage of the HEK293 cell manufacturing system is flexibility and the relative speed with which AAV vectors can be manufactured for early Phase 1/2 clinical trials, allowing the establishment of early indications of therapeutic benefit in patients. As we advance and scale up our processes for Phase 3 clinical and commercial scale manufacturing, we have transitioned to a cell-based suspension bioreactor format.
 Commercialization and Product Support
We have built our own commercial organizations in North America, Europe and Latin America to effectively support the commercialization of our products and product candidates, if approved, and we expect to expand on our efforts in these regions and build our organizations in other areas such as in Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Our intention is to expand our product portfolio and its geographic accessibility, whether via acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or through the continued development of our proprietary pipeline. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract management organizations to assist in the commercialization of our products in certain geographies. The commercial infrastructure for rare disease products typically consists of a targeted, specialty field organization that educates a limited and focused group of physicians supported by field management and internal support teams, which includes our patient support services hub, distribution team and managed care team. One challenge, unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases, is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. Our commercial and medical affairs teams focus on maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases.
Additional capabilities important to the rare disease marketplace include the management of key stakeholders such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government payers as well as single national payers in some countries outside the U.S. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest a significant amount of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to regulatory approval of the products that they are intended to support.

We continue to build commercial and medical affairs organizations as well as other capabilities across North America, Europe, Turkey, Latin America and Japan to meet the scientific educational needs of the healthcare providers and patients in the rare disease community, focusing on providing accurate disease state information and balanced product information across our portfolio for appropriate management of patients with rare disorders.
 Medical affairs is comprised of the following capabilities in support of our mission: medical information, patient advocacy, patient diagnosis liaisons, medical science liaisons, research and educational grants. Medical affairs will engage as early as Phase 1 and will continue work throughout the lifecycle of each product and product candidate as dictated by the specific scientific needs in each therapeutic area.
 Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state, and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Accordingly, our operations are and will be subject to a variety of regulations and other requirements, which vary from country to country. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources that has a significant impact on our capital expenditures and results of operations.
 Global Regulation of Clinical Studies
Clinical studies involve the administration of an investigational medicinal product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with protocols, Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable regulatory requirements. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments are typically submitted to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities as part of an IND or clinical trial application, or CTA. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s institutional review board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee, or EC, before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB or EC must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. 
 •Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 •Phase 4. In some cases, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. Regulatory authorities may condition approval of a marketing application for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory authority requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but regulatory authorities may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations.

The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed or sold in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually; 
 •conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication under an active IND and approved by an independent IRB representing each clinical site; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies; 
 •potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed drug substance and drug product are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP;
 •FDA inspection of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP; and 
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA.
 Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a significant application user fee, unless waived.
Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
The FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may impose additional requirements, such as post-marketing studies and/or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of NDAs and BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.
 Furthermore, the FDA has made available expedited programs to sponsors of regenerative medicine therapies that have been granted designation as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT). Regenerative medicine therapies include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products and human cell and tissue products. A sponsor may seek RMAT designation if its regenerative medicine product is intended for a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the regenerative medicine therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the U.S., except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase 2 meeting and submission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the U.S. that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested studies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the sponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor’s data.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product.
A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are bioequivalent (i.e. identical) to previously approved branded drugs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is bioequivalent to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, quality and performance characteristics, the strength of the drug, and intended use.
The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA or supplement includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, it must certify, among other things, that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, which is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Patent Term Restoration
 Some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Thus, for each approved product, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our related owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the original expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
EU Regulation
In the EU, to obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The content of the MAA is similar to that of an NDA or BLA filed in the U.S., with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
Authorization Procedures
 Medicines can be authorized by using the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. The centralized authorization procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid across the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan medicines. Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country; or (iii) they can be authorized in a EU member state in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure).
A Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting an MAA. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric studies and their timing relative to clinical studies in adults and an MAA must comply with the PIP to be validated.
MAA Review and Approval Timeframe and Accelerated Assessment
Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA that has been validated is 210 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. A favorable opinion on the application by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, will typically result in the granting of the marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. Generally, the entire review process takes approximately one year. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions.
 Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval
Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.
 PRIME Program
 PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. The program focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines by EMA. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early and proactive support to medicine developers to optimize development plans and the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks and enables accelerated assessment of medicines applications.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulatory authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to formal commitments for post approval clinical trials and studies, manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior regulatory authority review and approval.
Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and country or state agencies for compliance with GMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior regulatory approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to patients. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various laws targeting, among other things, fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; 
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which seeks to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe to ensure data subjects’ fundamental right to privacy in the EU in the digital age by imposing requirements and limitations relating to the processing, storage, purpose of collection, accuracy, security and transmission of personal data and the notification of regulation authorities about data breaches, accompanied by a strong sanctioning mechanism; 
 •the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which introduced a wide range of reforms, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections for generic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product program, requiring disclosures about compassionate care programs, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products;
 •the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals; and
 •state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as transparency laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and privacy and security of health information laws. 
Additional Regulation
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In addition to these anti-corruption laws, we are subject to import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and regulatory limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets.
 In addition, federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information or other information treated as confidential obtained from consumers and individuals.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations. Complying with these requirements may have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and results of operations.

 Employee Retention and Engagement
 The biotechnology industry is an extremely competitive labor market and we believe our company’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We invest in the growth and development of our employees through various training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills, including leadership development programs for new leaders which continued virtually during the pandemic. We also have a talent management framework and process in place that regularly conducts activities like performance management, succession and workforce planning in order to support our employees in their growth and development and ensure we provide learning opportunities.
 To continually assess and improve our employee retention and engagement, we conduct an engagement survey on an annual basis, the results of which are discussed with our board of directors, at all hands employee meetings and in individual functions. We take actions to address areas of employment concern and follow-up routinely to share with employees what we are doing.
 Inclusion and Diversity
 We strive toward having a diverse organization and are committed to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity. As of December 31, 2021, of the nine members of our board of directors, three directors were women, two directors self-identified as racially or ethnically diverse, and one director self-identified as LGBTQ+. As of December 31, 2021, women represented approximately 58% of our global workforce and approximately 43% of our leadership positions at the Vice President level or above. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 45% of our U.S. workforce were racially or ethnically diverse. We have included questions in our engagement survey to measure employee perception of inclusive culture, with the results from such survey on inclusion and diversity included in our corporate goals for fiscal year 2021 and as part of our corporate goals for 2022. Our business units review diversity data related to hiring, promotions, and retention on an ongoing basis. We have also established an Inclusion and Diversity Action Team (I&D Action Team) comprised of employee representatives throughout our company. Amongst other initiatives, our I&D Action Team engages in continual discussions across the various business functions to identify potential actions to address areas of improvement and is focused on building accountability across the organization to ensure we meet our diversity objectives. In 2021, we hosted our first Inclusion & Diversity summit for our employees to expand their understanding of inclusion and diversity on issues such as disability and transgender rights. We have also organized multiple internal employee resource groups to foster dialogue and engagement related to inclusion and diversity, such as UltraProud and X2 Women in Biotech.
