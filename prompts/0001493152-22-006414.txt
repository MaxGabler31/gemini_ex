Item 1. Business
Overview
 
EzFill is a leading on-demand fuel delivery company in South Florida and the only mobile fueling company that combines on-demand fills and subscription services which fill customer vehicles on routine intervals for the consumer, fleet, marine and other specialty markets. The emergence of the digital technology, GPS-Based / On-Demand consumer deliveries, and the sharp increase in home delivery of products and services during the COVID-era are trends expected to continue in the post-COVID economy. The increased adoption rate of such ‘at home’ or ‘at work’ delivery of products and services has become the method both individual and commercial customers prefer.

EzFill provides customers in South Florida the ability to have fuel delivered to their vehicles (cars, trucks, and specialty vehicles) without having to leave the comfort of their home, office, and job site. EzFill’s app-based platform conveniently brings the gas station to customers with a growing fleet of EzFill-branded, Mobile Fueling Trucks. EzFill’s business verticals align to the high-use, high demand cases in vehicle operations. These are; individual CONSUMERS, COMMERCIAL entities and SPECIALTY vehicle markets. | An EzFill Mobile Delivery Truck

For CONSUMERS, EzFill services individual “consumer” customers directly at their residences or places of work. In the consumer vertical, EzFill customers sign-up for EzFill services individually, or as part of an employer which offers discounted EzFill services to their employees as an employee benefit while at work at offices, in office parks or on-job locations. Fuel deliveries are completed at optimal times during the day for ‘at work’ customers or at night for residential deliveries. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the COMMERCIAL vertical, EzFill provides vital fuel delivery services to commercial fleets of delivery trucks, rental cars, livery operators, and job sites. Deliveries for the commercial vertical are completed during down-times, when the majority of commercial vehicles are at designated locations. This method also allows EzFill to complete multiple fills at once, while providing the commercial customers the benefit of a fleet of fueled vehicles ready for operations on any given morning. 
In the SPECIALTY vertical, EzFill adapts to each market based on the type of vehicles that can benefit from “at location” fuel delivery. In EzFill’s home market, Florida, their “specialty” vertical services hundreds of boat owners at the marinas at which they are docked. EzFill’s specialty market also includes equipment rental companies, construction job sites, agricultural operations, motorsports events and recreational vehicle grounds. 

EzFill Model – Resolving Pain Points in the Consumer and Commercial Fuel Customer Markets
 
EzFill’s experience in this market indicates that the legacy gas station model is ripe for disruption specifically by a model which works to address major issues with the status of the industry, such as:

● | Convenience. People find going to the gas station inconvenient and time consuming. Leaving the house a little late in the morning on an empty tank means arriving late to the office or stopping for gas on your way home after a long day is inconvenient. This number does not include the time it takes to drive to and from the gas station. Our solution saves our customers valuable time and shaves time off of our customers’ commutes to and from work. Our Mobile Fueling Truck brings a convenient fueling solution that we expect to disrupt the current industry by saving our customers valuable time and helping them to avoid the stress of not having a full tank of gas.

● | Fleet Driver Expense. When fleet managers send their vehicles to the gas station to fill up, they are paying for: (i) the driver to take the vehicle to the gas station; (ii) the gas the vehicle consumes on the way to and from the gas station; (iii) wear and tear on the vehicle being driven to the gas station; and (iv) indirectly the downtime for the vehicle being driven to the gas station, which usually will be during the regular working day due to the fact that an employee must take the vehicle there. When fleet managers use EzFill, they only pay for gas and we fill up the vehicles after hours so there is no downtime during the regular working day. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fleet Driver Fraud. Research conducted by Fleet News confirmed the 64% of fleets have been the victims of fuel theft or fuel fraud. According to a survey conducted by Shell, 93% of fleet managers think that some of their drivers are committing fraudulent activity and 41% of fleet managers think that more than 10% of their drivers are committing fraudulent activity. According to Shell’s research, 48% of fleet managers think that improving practices to tackle fraud could reduce a fleets fuel spend by more than 5% and 14% of fleet managers believe it would reduce fuel spend by more than 10%. EzFill’s solution tackles fraud head on by taking the drivers out of the equation. EzFill brings the gas directly to our customers fleets and reduces the risk of driver related fuel fraud. 
● | Operating Costs. The rising cost of real estate in major metros, over the past couple of years has caused many gas stations to close their doors, leaving major cities without significant competition, which could lead to higher local gas prices. According to data provided by Fueleconomy.gov there were 168,000 gas stations in 2004, compared to just 115,000 gas stations reported by marketwatch.com in February 2020 (a 31% drop). EzFill’s App-based approach lowers our underlying costs and allows us to offer gas with competitive pricing in each zip code in which we operate. 
● | Safety Concerns. Gas stations have a reputation of being unsafe locations. This reputation developed due to the many robberies and assaults that occur at gas stations. According to FBI crime data, over the past five years 1.3% of all violent crimes occurred at gas stations. Violent crimes such as robberies and assaults are commonplace at gas stations because often, customer’s need to exit their vehicles in remote and secluded areas, at late hours, with improper lighting and security at the location. EzFill’s Mobile Fueling Trucks address these safety issues by bringing the gas to the consumer, who, from the comfort of their home or office can order a fill-up via our App without even going outdoors. The customer simply needs to place the order and leave the gas tank access open on their vehicle. 
● | Fraud Concerns. Gas stations are hubs for fraud issues. These issues primarily emanate from gas stations employing mostly old-fashioned magnetic strip credit card readers. Gas stations experience hundreds of millions of dollars in credit card fraud annually. According to the Florida Department of Agriculture, more than 1500 skimmers were found at Florida gas stations in 2019. A study from FICO, found that fraud from credit card skimmers is increasing at a rate of 10% per year. The US Secret Service reports finding between 20 and 30 credit card skimmers at gas pumps, per week. EzFill’s platform does not store any customer credit card data and uses the latest in credit card processing technology to verify cards and secure customers’ payments to ensure authenticity of purchases. 
● | Addressing Environmental Concerns. We can never eliminate our environmental exposure completely. However, by delivering fuel to areas with high vehicle density, we are lowering the environmental impact by reducing the number of separate trips our customers make to refuel their vehicles. Since EzFill sources direct from oil companies on a daily basis, we have a very high turnover of inventory and do not store our fuel in underground tanks. All our tanks go through a rigorous annual inspection, plus they are visually inspected before and after every shift to ensure proper fuel storage and no loss of vapors. A rapid turnover of inventory and daily tank inspections are not available for underground tanks used by retail gas stations.

● | Sanitary and Touchless. According to a study conducted by the Kymberly Clark Group, the gas station pump handle is the dirtiest surface Americans touch on their way to work. Also, according to a recent study conducted by busbudy.com, gas station pumps have 11,000 times more bacteria than the common household toilet seat, while pump station buttons contain 15,000 times more. In addition to being germ and bacteria infested, a recent article by njtvonline.org highlighted the near impossibility of social distancing at self-service gas stations, further exacerbating the health risks of going to the gas station. Proper social distancing is required to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Our service is a sanitary and touch free way for our customers to get gas. We believe our service eliminates one of the dirtiest and most unhealthy places from our customers once mandatory to-do list.

Our Product Offerings
 
We provide gas delivery via our Mobile Fueling Trucks in the greater South Florida area and expect to soon begin fueling in other areas in Florida. Our goal is to service all our customers across all our lines of business at predictable locations during vehicle downtimes. Our fleet currently includes 24 Mobile Fueling Trucks that we utilize to deliver fuel directly to our customers. We have three major lines of business and to our knowledge we are the only company in the space which fuels all three verticals:

1. | SERVICING CONSUMERS AT HOME AND AT WORK 
---+--------------------------------------------

 
We offer residential fueling services to customers who can request a fuel delivery through our app and have fuel delivered directly to their vehicle, from the comfort of their home or apartment building, while they go about their night. We offer convenient weekly schedules to our residential customers, so they can live with the comfort of knowing that they will never be without a full tank of gas when they need it. Additionally, our competitive pricing keeps our residential customers from having to travel out of their neighborhood for lower gas prices. Our residential customers currently pay a delivery fee of $4.99 for each delivery or they have the option to pay $9.99 per month for unlimited deliveries. We may increase these prices in the future. We currently offer delivery to residential customers in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties and expect to soon begin deliveries in other parts of Florida. Our service is a great new amenity for condominiums, which has been widely used by residents of the buildings we service and has been enhancing residents’ experience.
 
Through entering agreements with local and national businesses, we work directly with businesses human resource departments to offer employee perks, and fuel employees’ cars while they are working. This is a creative benefit for employers to offer, enabling their employees to have their cars filled, stress free. Additionally, we work directly with the landlords of corporate office parks to bring the amenity of EzFill to their tenants. Our corporate employee fueling is currently done at competitive prices with no delivery fee. Our corporate office park solution offers benefits to employers and EzFill. Benefits to employers include: (i) a new perk to offer their employees; and (ii) happier employees who do not have to waste precious time going to the gas station. Benefits to EzFill include: (i) multiple deliveries at one location creates efficiencies and cuts operating costs; (ii) the employers serve as “influencers” which reduces our marketing costs for each location; and (iii) push-marketing by the employers also results in more residential consumer fills.

2. | SERVICING COMMERCIAL ENTITIES 
---+----------------------------------

 
We partner with and offer national and local businesses who operate fleets an alternative solution for fueling their fleet to reduce the businesses operational costs and improve fleet efficiency. Our solution for fleets helps businesses: (i) save money spent on expensive gas stations; (ii) save money on paying employees to go to gas stations; (iii) eliminate unnecessary wear and tear to Company fleet vehicles on trips to the gas station; (iv) better monitor their gas consumption; (v) eliminate employee mistakes (putting regular gas into a diesel engine); and (vi) prevent theft by employees (customers have reported instances where it was months before they realized their employee was making unauthorized charges on their fleet card). This product offering is sold with zero fees, our fleet customers pay only for the gas they consume. We may charge delivery fees to fleet customers in the future.
 

3. | SERVICING SPECIALTY MARKETS 
---+--------------------------------

 
EzFill delivers fuel directly to other, market-specific personal and commercial vehicles and tanks. In our home market, the prevalence of boats and boat owners was the first specialty market we developed, particular to the south Florida area which is the base of our services. Marina gas stations are some of the highest priced in the country. We offer low prices and pre-scheduling so our marine customers can get affordable fuel whenever they need it. The same is true for the markets which we have targeted to enter. In these markets we find similar, market-specific vehicles which our future customers use for; construction or agricultural purposes, personal or recreational vehicle use, or sporting events where a large concentration of vehicles can be serviced at specific locations.
 
Customers
 
In addition to our individual, residential customers, we also have structured relationships with property management companies and builders who co-market our services as a benefit to their residents and allow our trucks to enter their communities to fill vehicle owners at their single family homes, condominiums or apartments. Employers who have offered at-work fueling as a corporate perk have included Ryder, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean, Telemundo, Loreal, Y Green, and more. Customers we have signed up through our corporate offerings may also be customers of our residential offering. Our services are very flexible, and our residential customers do not have to sign any long-term commitments with us and can decide not to use our service whenever they choose.
 
Our commercial vertical has serviced the fleets for many national and local businesses, such as a leading national delivery company, a leading OEM, Enterprise, Telemundo, Easy Scripts, Air Around the Clock, Boucher Brothers, and The Pullman Hotel.
 
In our specialty market vertical, we service hundreds of boats at various marinas across Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, as well as boats at customers’ homes. We are a preferred delivery partner for a mobile application with thousands of boat-owner users. We have recently begun developing this line of business and it is growing, mostly through existing customer outreach and strategic partnerships with marinas.

Software Systems, IT, User Interface and Experience
 

Our software systems provide us logistical and cost saving efficiencies that allow us to forecast the need for truckloads of fuel to effectively service clusters of customers in a specific area or zip code. At the front end of our system, we employ an app-based approach that provides all our customers with an easy-to-engage user interface and ordering system. Customers are able to select the times and locations of their on-demand or routinely scheduled fills and manage their account on their mobile device or desktop system.
 
In the back end of our system, we aggregate customer orders based on their location and expected gallon demand for their vehicles. The aggregation of customer orders based on these variables triggers a truckload fill of one of our mobile tankers designated for each of the customer orders our system generates.
 
Our software and IT systems have been developed and customized in-house to provide cost-saving efficiencies which produce higher margins than traditional, gas station fuel margins.
 
We are planning to expand our software capabilities using AI and machine learning algorithms that will, among other things, automatically generate outbound. “fill reminder” communications to customers based on their recorded usage amounts and time intervals.
 
Our Mobile Application
 

The EzFill Mobile Application has been designed for iPhone and Android devices with our customers and convenience in mind.
 
Sign Up: The EzFill App provides a quick and easy registration process.

Profile Management: The EzFill App provides easy profile management where users can seamlessly update personal information, such as: vehicle details and location, this way we are able to provide the best services to our customers.
 
Location Sharing: This feature enables our customers to simply drop a pin at their location on an integrated map which lets our driver know where to deliver the fuel.
 
Request Fuel Delivery: The EzFill App lets our customers pick the type and quantity of fuel to be delivered in addition to the time and date of availability.
 
Weekly Delivery Schedule: The EzFill App also enables our customers to preschedule weekly deliveries, on a specific day of the week. This feature enables our customers to request their delivery for a specific time window, this ensures they can schedule their fill up at convenient times when they would be busy attending other tasks and their car is idle.
 
Push Notifications: The EzFill App has a push notification feature. This allows us to keep customers informed of all the activities associated with the service they have requested. We also use it to keep our customers updated with recent offers and discounts, which helps to boost customer satisfaction and promotes our business.
 
Transaction History: The EzFill App offers our customers the ability to always view their transaction history. This gives our customers an option to check the previous fuel delivery requests and bills.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Information provided by Statista indicates that there are about 273 million registered cars in the United States as of 2018. According to the US Energy Information Administration, in 2019 there was approximately 39 million fill-ups per day. According to Statista.com, in 2018, US gas stations produced revenues of roughly 503 billion dollars. EzFill wants to take advantage of the growing number of US drivers and the dwindling number of gas stations by bringing the gas directly to the consumers. We feel that our service is years in the making and solves many problems posed by the legacy gas station. EzFill presents a new way for Americans to get gas: at home, at the office, wherever, on demand.
 
The on-demand market continues to grow. According to a study conducted by rockresearch.com, in 2019 the on-demand market was $110 billion, growing by 18% from the previous year. The same study indicates that participation in the on-demand market has tripled since 2016, with an estimated 64+ million consumers purchasing on-demand goods or services. EzFill believes that the on-demand market will continue to grow and expand into new areas, such as the gasoline market.
 

We believe our market opportunity is to expand into major MSAs across the continental U.S. with similar population size and demographics to the Miami-Dade - Broward - Palm Beach MSAs. We want to be in locations where people rely heavily on their personal cars to get places. Based on our research, we have identified several major MSAs across the U.S that would be attractive for expansion.

As we expand to a new market, we plan to employ a strategy that has helped us build a strong base of business in our existing market. The strategy we developed begins with sales in our fleet category to build a base of business in the target city, while developing and strengthening our delivery operations. Next, after launch, we secure corporate and landlord agreements to allow us to begin marketing our services to their employees and tenants. These agreements include fueling at large office parks during daytime hours and fueling at residential buildings during nighttime hours.
 
We generate business through establishing corporate and landlord partnerships, we then leverage companies’ internal communication channels to market directly to their employees or residential tenants. By implementing our digital marketing campaigns as well as placement of our content throughout residential and corporate facilities, we are able to develop greater brand awareness. We coordinate with our partners to set up organic marketing efforts with our brand ambassadors to help increase recognition and assist users with downloading the app and setting up their accounts.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our strategy is to leverage our established business partnerships and generate organic methods of acquiring new markets. This has given us significant brand recognition by the consumer and has enabled us to acquire competitor territories. In doing so, we have generated a substantial presence and footprint in the regional area in which we operate. As we continue to develop our business relationships and expand our geographic footprint in the South Florida area and other areas of Florida, our goal is to open in new markets along the east coast.
 
EzFill’s current focus is on expanding its geographic footprint. We aim to open in new markets along the east coast in the future both organically and through acquisitions of existing companies in the space. We make our expansion decisions based off of research into optimal target markets where public transportation is less prevalent, leading to more residents owning cars and the areas where a demand for lifestyle improving technology is present. We also consider State/City/County regulations when assessing new areas to expand into. We are targeting high potential locations with the least regulations on mobile fuel delivery.
 
EzFill currently has strategic partnerships with businesses across industries such as property management, parking solutions services, travel industry, delivery industry, transportation and logistics, marinas, and other diversified business sectors. By establishing these strategic business-to-business relationships, we are able to offer cost effective business solutions, whether through human resource departments as employee perks, optimization of efficiency for fleet companies, or tenant satisfaction by adding amenities.
 
EzFill believes a strategic partnership with a major oil company will help with our expansion by enabling us to lower cost and attract a larger customer base by selling branded gasoline. However, there cannot be any assurance that EzFill will be able to obtain such a strategic partnership. The oil companies Exxon and Shell are both in the mobile fuel delivery space though investments in mobile fueling companies.
 
Technology License Agreement
 
On April 7, 2021, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement with Fuel Butler LLC. Under the terms of the license, the Company issued 265,728 shares of its common stock to the licensor upon signing. The Company also issued 332,160 shares to the licensor in May 2021 upon the filing of a patent application related to the licensed technology. The Company also issued 186,010 shares to the licensor upon the Company’s IPO. The Company will issue up to 730,752 additional shares to the licensor upon the achievement of certain milestones. In addition, the Company has granted stock options for 531,456 shares at an exercise price of $3.76 per share that will become exercisable for three years after the end of the fiscal year in which certain sales levels are achieved using the licensed technology. The Company has the option for four years after the achievement of certain milestones to either acquire the technology or acquire the licensor for the purchase price of 1,062,913 of its common shares. Until the Company exercise one of these options, it will share with the licensor 50% of pre-revenue costs and 50% of the net revenue, as defined, from the use of the technology. The Company does not expect any significant revenue from this agreement until at least the second half of 2022.
 
Under the Technology Agreement, the Company will license proprietary technology that the Company believes will enable the Company to expand its services into certain other markets. To this end, the Company believes this technology will allow the Company to provide its fuel service in high density areas like New York City and potentially allow entry into parking structures with portable containers without the necessity of driving fuel trucks into these locations.

Competition
 
EzFill is a mobile fuel delivery service in the South Florida area and competes with other local fuel delivery companies and gas stations. We differentiate ourselves by allowing our customers to request our service via a mobile app and delivering the fuel directly to the end user. We use our innovative technology and excellent concierge service to offer convenient fueling solutions to all our vertical markets at different times of the day to maximize the efficiency of each mobile fueling truck. To our knowledge, there are no significant mobile fueling competitors in the markets we currently serve.
 
We distinguish ourselves from our competitors by:
 

● | Prioritizing our customer’s experience and satisfaction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Streamlining our customers ordering experience; 
● | Rigorously vetting and training our drivers; 
● | Providing the latest in scheduling, GPS technology, and payment systems; 
● | Offering competitive pricing in the zip codes which we service; 
● | Providing all our customers with certified, accurate reports and detailed invoices. 

 
Though the electric vehicle industry is growing, we do not consider this relatively new subsegment of the vehicle market a threat to our business model or growth trajectory. The vast majority of vehicles are gas or diesel powered and the entire fuel industry is a major component of the economy. According to Inside Climate News, less than 5% of the vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2020 were electric vehicles.
 
Additionally, the continued growth of the electric vehicle industry means more and more traditional gas stations are closing because of: (i) high overhead because of rising real-estate prices; (ii) lack of demand due to electric vehicle adoption; and (iii) their inability to fuel vehicles outside of their station. Our mobile fueling solution allows us to service many zip codes with one truck, so if sales slowdown in one area we are able to transition seamlessly to areas with higher demand.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our industry has certain government regulations, EzFill is dedicated to ensure that we are always operating in a way that is in compliance with all applicable regulations.

1. | DOT/Hazmat Registration: We are required to be registered with the Department of Transportation to transport and dispense hazardous materials. EzFill as a company is registered to transport and dispense hazardous material. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Weights and Measures: In order to ensure the accuracy of our fuel sales to customers, our fuel meters and registers have to be calibrated and certified by the Florida Department of Agriculture. EzFill’s fuel meters and registers have been calibrated and certified by the Department of Agriculture to be a fuel retailer. 
3. | CDL Licensing with Hazmat Endorsement: Drivers are required to have a Commercial Driver’s License with a Hazmat endorsement in order to operate the Mobile Fueling Trucks. All of our drivers have their Commercial Driver’s License with the Hazmat endorsement. 

 
Our operations may also be subject to local fire marshal regulations, which varies in the different cities and counties. EzFill keeps up to date on the local regulations in each of the locations it operates and does ample research into local regulations before opening in any new location.
