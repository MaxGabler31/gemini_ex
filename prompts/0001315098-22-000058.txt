Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at that time.
Today, an average of 49.5 million people from around the world come to Roblox every day to connect with friends. Together, they play, learn, communicate, explore, and expand their relationships in millions of 3D digital worlds that are entirely user-generated, built by our community of millions of active developers. We call this emerging category “human co-experience,” which we consider to be the new form of social interaction we envisioned back in 2004.
Some refer to our category as the metaverse, a term often used to describe the concept of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces in a virtual universe. The idea of a metaverse has been written about by futurists and science fiction authors for more than 30 years. With the advent of increasingly powerful consumer computing devices, cloud computing, and high bandwidth internet connections, the concept of the metaverse is materializing.
Our Roblox human co-experience platform consists of the Roblox Client, the Roblox Studio, and the Roblox Cloud. Roblox Client is the application that allows users to seamlessly explore 3D digital worlds. Roblox Studio is the free toolset that allows developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D experiences and other content accessed with the Roblox Client. Roblox Cloud includes the services and infrastructure that power our human co-experience platform.
Our mission is to connect a billion people with optimism and civility. We are building a human co-experience platform that enriches the way people connect, create and express themselves through shared experiences. We are constantly improving the ways in which the Roblox Platform, or our Platform, supports shared experiences, ranging from how these experiences are built by an engaged community of developers to how they are enjoyed and safely accessed by users across the globe.
The Roblox Platform has a number of key characteristics:
•Identity. All users have unique identities in the form of avatars that allow them to express themselves as whoever or whatever they want to be. These avatars are portable across experiences.
•Friends. Users interact with friends, some of whom they know in the real world and others who they meet on Roblox.
•Immersive. The experiences on Roblox are 3D and immersive. As we continue to improve the Roblox Platform, these experiences will become increasingly engaging and indistinguishable from the real world.
•Anywhere. Users, developers and creators on Roblox are from all over the world, including North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. In 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Songhua River Investment Limited, or Songhua, an affiliate of Tencent, to operate a Chinese version of the Roblox Platform. Tencent was granted a license to operate and publish the Chinese version of the Roblox Client under the name “Luobulesi” in December 2020. Currently, Luobulesi is not being offered to users in China. As of December 31, 2021, the Roblox Client operates on iOS, Android, PC, Mac, and Xbox, and supports VR experiences on PC using Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets.
•Low Friction. It is simple to set up an account on Roblox, and free for users to enjoy experiences on the platform. Users can quickly traverse between and within experiences either on their own or with their friends. It is also easy for developers to build experiences and then publish them to the Roblox Cloud so that they are then accessible to users on the Roblox Client across all platforms. On behalf of the developers and creators, Roblox also provides critical services such as user acquisition, billing, collections, content moderation, translation, safety, regulatory compliance, and customer support. This makes it easier and simpler for even individual developers and creators and small studios to be successful developers and creators.
•Variety of Content. Roblox is a vast and expanding universe of developer and creator-built content. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 29 million experiences on Roblox, and in the year ended December 31, 2021, over 1,900 of those experiences generated more than 1 million hours of engagement in 2021. These ranged from experiences that simulate building and operating a theme park to adopting a pet, scuba diving, creating and playing your own superhero, and more. There are also millions of creator-built virtual items, such as hats, shirts, and pants, with which users can personalize their avatars and 3D virtual items, assets and sounds that creators can incorporate in experiences. Historically, Roblox has also created virtual items with which users can personalize their avatars and these items are still available in the Avatar Marketplace. Our focus today and going forward, however, is on user-generated content. 
•Economy. Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux. Users who choose to purchase Robux can spend the currency on experiences and on items for their avatar. Developers and creators earn Robux by building engaging experiences and compelling items that users want to purchase. Roblox enables developers and creators to convert Robux back into real-world currency.
•Safety. Multiple systems are integrated into the Roblox Platform to promote civility and ensure the safety of our users. These systems are designed to enforce real-world laws, and are designed to extend beyond minimum regulatory requirements.
Growth at Roblox has been driven primarily by a significant investment in technology and two mutually reinforcing network effects: content and social.
First, user-generated content, built by our community of developers and creators, powers our Platform. As developers and creators build increasingly high-quality content, more users are attracted to our Platform. The more users on our Platform, the higher the engagement and the more attractive Roblox becomes to developers and creators. With more users, more Robux are spent on our Platform, incentivizing developers and creators to design increasingly engaging content and encouraging new developers and creators to start building on our platform.
Second, our Platform is social. When users join, they typically play with friends. This inspires them to invite more friends, who in turn, invite their friends, driving organic growth. The more friends that each of our users has playing together on the platform, the more valuable and engaging the platform becomes. This drives more users to our Platform through word of mouth from their existing friends on the Platform.
The Roblox Platform combines significant bookings and revenue with strong unit economics, free cash flow generation and high growth.
•As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 29 million experiences on Roblox, and in the year ended December 31, 2021, over 1,900 of those experiences generated more than 1 million hours of engagement in 2021.
•Daily active users, or DAUs, on Roblox grew 85% from 17.6 million DAUs in 2019 to 32.6 million in 2020 and grew 40% to 45.5 million in 2021.
•Daily paying users on Roblox grew from approximately 184,000 in 2019 to approximately 490,000 in 2020, and approximately 678,000 in 2021.
•Hours engaged on Roblox grew 124% from 13.7 billion in 2019 to 30.6 billion in 2020 and grew 35% to 41.4 billion in 2021.
•Revenue grew 82% from $508.4 million in 2019 to $923.9 million in 2020 and grew 108% to $1,919.2 million in 2021.
•Bookings grew 171% from $694.3 million in 2019 to $1,882.5 million in 2020 and grew 45% to $2,725.7 million in 2021.
•Net loss was $71.0 million, $253.3 million, and $491.7 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.
•Net cash provided by operating activities was $99.2 million, $524.3 million, and $659.1 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.
•Free cash flow was $14.5 million, $411.2 million, and $558.0 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively.
See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.
Our Community
Roblox is powered by user-generated content from our community of developers and creators who build immersive and engaging experiences found only on Roblox, as well as the vast majority of the items for customizing avatars. Upon signing up for Roblox, users personalize their avatars by selecting body types, clothes, and gear. Users are then free to immerse themselves in the millions of developer-built experiences. Developers and creators can earn our virtual currency, Robux, through microtransactions in their experiences, by selling virtual items and through engagement-based rewards. Robux can be exchanged for real-world currency through our Developer Exchange Program. This ability to generate income encourages developers and creators to invest in more and better content that attracts more users. As users enjoy our platform with each other and invite more friends to Roblox, developers and creators attract larger audiences and are encouraged to create even more. Many users eventually become developers and creators, and nearly all developers and creators started as users.
Our Users
In the year ended December 31, 2021, 45.5 million average DAUs across over 180 countries enjoyed experiences on Roblox across mobile, desktop and console platforms. Our users are diversified across multiple dimensions, including age, geography, platform, and gender. Each day users can express themselves through their avatars, explore different worlds, and engage with others in the Roblox community. In the year ended December 31, 2021, there were over 1,900 experiences that generated at least 1 million hours of engagement and nearly 350 experiences that generated 10 million hours of engagement or more. During the year ended December 31, 2021, users spent 41.4 billion hours engaged on our Platform, or an average of 2.5 hours per DAU each day. Over the same period, our users explored an average of around 18 different experiences on the Roblox Platform per month.

Our Developers and Creators
We offer users the ability to build engaging, immersive experiences that they can easily share with the Roblox community. Experiences refer to the various titles that can be enjoyed by our users on our Platform. Users who create experiences are called developers and those who create avatar items are called creators. Developers can also build and sell custom tools and 3D models to help other developers create experiences. Collectively, our developers and creators contribute to our Platform in three ways: by building experiences for users to enjoy, by building avatar items for users to acquire and express themselves with, and by building tools and 3D models for other developers and creators to utilize. In this way, our developers and creators enable us to offer a wide variety of experiences and cost-effectively crowd-source our experiences, marketplace content, and development environment. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we had millions of active developers across more than 170 countries who had either created or updated an experience on the Roblox Platform. Our developer and creator community includes individuals with a wide spectrum of professional capabilities and team sizes, ranging from young students and independent hobbyists, all the way to full-time studios.
We measure the health and success of our developer and creator community based on their earnings and the user engagement in their experiences. As our Platform has scaled, our monetizing developers and creators have enjoyed meaningful earnings expansion over time, reflecting the increasing monetization of our Platform and driving a growing incentive for our developers and creators to continue to build high-quality content.
Developers and creators earn Robux through two main methods on Roblox: (1) through microtransactions on virtual items (both in-experience and in the Avatar Marketplace) and (2) through our engagement-based reward program, or Premium Payouts, which rewards developers based on the number of hours spent in their experiences by Roblox Premium subscribers. There were nearly 1.7 million developers and creators who earned Robux on the Roblox platform in the month ending December 31, 2021, of which over 7,000 developers qualified for and were registered in our Developer Exchange Program and therefore met certain conditions, such as having earned at least 100,000 Robux, a verified developer account, and an account in good standing, and were eligible to exchange their earned Robux for real-world currency. Of such developers and creators, for the year ended December 31, 2021, over 5,500 developers and creators actually exchanged their earned Robux for real-world currency through our Developer Exchange Program. For the same period, there were over 2,200 developers and creators that earned $10,000 or more and over 500 developers and creators that earned $100,000 or more in Robux. On an engagement basis, for the year ended December 31, 2021, there were over 1,900 experiences that generated at least one million hours of engagement per year and nearly 350 experiences that generated ten million hours of engagement or more.
Reward and Experiences Breakdown
We invest in our developer and creator community by providing a comprehensive set of tools and services through Roblox Studio that enable them to easily build, publish, and monetize experiences. In addition, our developer relations function focuses on providing appropriate support for all developers and creators to ensure engagement and growth in our developer and creator community. This includes creating self-guided tutorials, managing and moderating our online developer and creator forums, and operating special programs for aspiring and top developers and creators such as our incubator program and our annual Roblox Developers Conference.
The investment in our developer and creator community has resulted in an ever-changing offering of diverse content for our users to explore and engage in. The chart below on the left shows the percentage of in-experience engagement within the top 1,000 experiences by month from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. In the last twelve months, roughly 90% of our users’ in-experience engagement was distributed across the top 1,000 experiences. The bottom right chart shows the top 100 grossing experiences by month from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2021. The color coding indicates the year in which each individual experience was created. Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2021, approximately half of the highest grossing experiences were made in the prior two years and a third were made in the same year.
Our Products and Technology
The Roblox Platform is the underlying technology and infrastructure that supports shared experiences for an average of 45.5 million DAUs. The platform is composed of three elements:
•Roblox Client—The application that allows users to explore 3D digital worlds.
•Roblox Studio—The free toolset that allows developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D experiences and other content accessed with the Roblox Client.
•Roblox Cloud—The services and infrastructure that power the human co-experience platform.
Since our founding, we have invested heavily in building the Roblox Platform, and 74% of our employees are dedicated to maintaining, improving, and expanding it. Here is how our technology supports the key characteristics of the Roblox Platform.
Identity
The Roblox avatar system allows users to create and personalize their unique 3D identities. Our avatar technology supports a wide variety of character styles, ranging from classic “blocky” avatars with minimal motion and unrealistic proportions, to highly detailed stylized avatars with human proportions and realistic movement.
The Roblox Client features the Avatar Editor, which enables users to manipulate the size and body shape of their avatars as well as equip their avatar with clothing, gear, animations, simulated gestures, or emotes, and other accessories from the Avatar Marketplace. Our avatar system allows users to attach practically any accessory to any avatar maximizing the combinatorial variety of avatar configurations supported by the platform. Users manipulate their avatar through a consistent set of controls for emotes, basic movement, and tap-to-move functionality which adapts to dynamically changing virtual environments. The Roblox client normalizes camera and avatar control inputs from different device form factors, including mobile, tablet, PC and game console to simplify the process of building multiplayer, multiplatform, and avatar-based experiences.
Within most experiences, avatars appear exactly how they were configured in the Avatar Editor, creating a sense of persistent identity. However, developers, when designing experiences, have the freedom to dynamically reconfigure all or part of the participating avatars to meet the specific needs of the developer’s virtual experience.
Friends
The Roblox Client allows users to connect through various means, including matching their phone and email, detecting nearby players, or simply meeting in 3D experiences. The social graph created by these connections is stored in the Roblox Cloud and requires mutual opt-in to avoid unwanted communications.
The social graph is central to human co-experience. When a user chooses to join an experience, the Roblox Cloud is designed to automatically place that user into the same virtual environment as others connected through the social graph. In addition, most developers allow users to purchase private servers that allow groups of friends to share an exclusive, invite-only instance of a 3D experience.
The Roblox Platform supports text-based chat among users sharing the same 3D experience and between users connected through the social graph. For safety, every message passes through filters that block personally identifiable information, or PII, profanity, and offensive language. Using advanced pattern matching and machine learning, our chat filters are constantly evolving and process billions of messages per day.
Immersive
The Roblox Platform allows developers to build deeply immersive 3D environments where users can share synchronous experiences with others, independent of where they may be physically. The Roblox Client provides users with intuitive camera and input controls that are tuned for each device’s form factor. By abstracting these controls from developers, the process of building cross platform 3D experiences is greatly simplified.
Developers use Roblox Studio to easily build 3D experiences that are then rendered and simulated on the Roblox Platform. The Roblox Client leverages efficient low-level hardware-specific device APIs, such as Vulkan for Android devices and Metal for Apple devices, to efficiently render those experiences. Each experience combines thousands of meshes, textures, 3D models, and animations that are brought to life through techniques such as physically based rendering, dynamic shadowmap lighting, and fully 3D smooth voxelized terrain.
Each 3D experience is simulated in the Roblox Cloud with a custom physics engine built for rigid body and constraint-based physics. Using a combination of novel mathematical formulations and aggressive optimization, the engine can simulate a large number of complex mechanisms at high levels of fidelity. To achieve an optimal balance between latency, scale, and consistency, computations for the simulation are distributed across Roblox Clients and the Roblox Cloud.
Assets that make up the 3D experience are stored in a persistent tree hierarchy that is the foundation for collaborative editing and interactive multiplayer experiences. The hierarchy can be modified through APIs which serve as a powerful abstraction layer making it easy to create experiences that are consistent across all Roblox Clients, regardless of device type. During simulation, this data is dynamically replicated within the Roblox Cloud and selectively transmitted to Roblox Clients. The Roblox Client then constructs and renders its own view of the 3D experience.
Low Friction
The Roblox Platform gives users the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly, on most popular client devices, and from anywhere in the world over existing broadband and cellular networks. As of December 31, 2021, the Roblox Client operates on iOS, Android, PC, Mac, and Xbox, and supports VR experiences on PC using Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets. With Roblox, developers can build an experience once and then expect that experience to operate consistently on all supported devices.
The Roblox Client is designed for the rapid movement of users between experiences. Almost immediately upon launching a new experience, the Roblox Client will begin simulating and rendering the virtual world using a partial representation of the environment at a low level of detail. As more and higher fidelity assets are received by the Roblox Client, the fidelity of the experience automatically improves.
Assets are delivered to the Roblox Client through geographically distributed content delivery networks. The Roblox Cloud determines the format, level of detail, and priority of each asset sent in order to optimize for the capabilities and bandwidth available to the client device. For large experiences, the Roblox Client can dynamically purge unnecessary assets from device memory, ensuring that a single large experience can be played simultaneously on different devices regardless of device memory capacity.
The Roblox Cloud is central to enabling low-latency, responsive gameplay within 3D environments having millions of concurrent players. When a user joins a 3D experience, the Roblox Cloud assigns that user to a particular game instance based on, among other considerations, the user’s social graph, geographic location, spoken language, and age group. When the number of users in a given experience increases, the Roblox Cloud automatically spawns additional server instances necessary to support additional users. The Platform optimally packs these instances onto physical servers and allocates compute resources based on the resource requirements of each instance. Developers can choose to allow up to 100 users within an instance, but may choose fewer to optimize their experience.
Developers have access to high-speed data stores in the Roblox Cloud where information about users and each simulated environment can be persisted. This, along with other services hosted in the Roblox Cloud, make it possible for a developer to build, launch, scale and monetize a 3D experience without any additional tools or services.
The majority of services operated by the Roblox Cloud are hosted in Roblox managed data centers. For some of our high-speed databases, scalable object storage, and message queuing services we leverage Amazon Web Services and, when additional compute resources are required, the Roblox Cloud can leverage Amazon EC2. All servers tasked with simulating the virtual environment and optimizing assets for Roblox Clients are owned by Roblox and operate from data centers and regional PoPs widely distributed across 23 cities in North America, Asia, and Europe. As of December 31, 2021, the Roblox Cloud uses over 40,000 servers. The Roblox Cloud is designed to be fault tolerant and prepared for disaster recovery and we are expanding into multiple availability zones and data centers to improve reliability and fault tolerance.
Data centers in the Roblox Cloud are linked through a high-performance dedicated backbone network bypassing the public internet for server-to-server calls and we operate under an open peering policy where we have direct interconnection with Internet providers globally. Operating our own network maximizes performance and increases the immersiveness experienced by our users.
Variety of Content
Developers and creators build nearly all of the content for the Roblox Platform. Their efforts contribute to an expanding content library that includes approximately 29 million of experiences and millions of items for the Avatar Marketplace as of December 31, 2021.
Developers build, publish, and operate 3D experiences with Roblox Studio, a free suite of tools accessible to all skill levels, from novice to professional. Teams can work together using built-in access control management and collaborative editing. Once content is built, it can be replicated and shared across multiple experiences giving developers the ability to scale their efforts and make rapid updates.
In addition to constructing 3D objects and environments, developers can script complex behaviors into their virtual experience with Roblox Luau. Based on Lua, an interpreted light-weight programming language popular in the gaming industry, Roblox Luau adds an optional static type system and a highly optimized interpreter that maximizes performance on Roblox Clients and in the Roblox Cloud. Using scripts, developers can modify the environment, control object behavior, and create new ways for users to interact with the virtual environment. Within Roblox Studio, developers have access to a powerful script editor which supports autocomplete, debugging, and the ability to emulate the Roblox Client running on supported devices.
Developers can share their work with other developers through the Studio Marketplace. The Studio Marketplace drives collaboration within our developer community, accelerates creation of new experiences, and provides additional ways for developers to monetize their work. As of December 31, 2021, the Studio Marketplace contained millions of models, meshes, textures, scripts, audio clips, developer tools, and packaged combinations of these items.
We provide developers with reference material, tutorials, community forums, and analytics to build their creations. Dev Hub includes reference material, API documentation, and tutorials for developers. Developer Forum is a private forum for qualified developers which provides insight on new features, community initiatives, recruitment opportunities, bug reporting, and direct engagement with our employees. Edu Hub provides content for educators, students, and parents who are using Roblox as a tool to learn coding, 3D design, and digital civility. All developers on the Roblox Platform have access to dashboards that show daily visits and earned Robux. For top developers we provide more robust reporting.
Within the Roblox Client, users find experiences through personalized content recommendations and search. Recommendations are based on past user behavior, the social graph, and basic demographic information collected at signup. An emphasis is always placed on experiences where someone you are connected with is present. The search engine automatically learns user intent, accounting for misspellings, slang, and multilingual queries.
Anywhere
The Roblox Platform serves a global audience. In the year ended December 31, 2021, developers from over 170 countries and users spanning over 180 countries accessed our Platform.
Localization and compliance systems embedded within the Roblox Client and Roblox Cloud help to lower cultural barriers and enable our developers to meet regional requirements with little to no additional effort.
Developers can build experiences in their native language and then, using machine translation and advanced pattern recognition, the Roblox Cloud automatically translates those experiences into 11 languages including simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Developers also have the ability to customize all or part of their translations if needed.
To meet an evolving global regulatory environment, the Roblox Client can adjust a user’s experience and available content based on their age, device type, current location and where the client application was obtained. This allows Roblox to dynamically apply relevant content filters, anti-addiction rules, payment limits, and parental consent requirements.
The localization and compliance systems are also central to Luobu, our joint venture with Songhua, which we believe will form the basis of growing our brand penetration in the China market. In December 2020, Tencent received a publishing license from the National Press and Publication Administration of the Chinese government to publish and operate a localized version of the Roblox Client as a game in China under the name “Luobulesi.” The localized version of the Roblox Client, Luobulesi, is not currently being offered to users in China. Luobu is continuing to focus on creating opportunities for local Chinese developers to learn a localized version of Roblox Studio for building and publishing experiences and content on our global Platform. See the section titled “Risk Factors—We may not realize the benefits expected through our China joint venture and the joint venture could have adverse effects on our business.”
Economy
Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and Roblox website. Roblox works with multiple payment and gift card processors including Amazon, Apple, BlackHawk, ePay, Google, Incomm, PayPal, Vantiv, and Xsolla. Roblox relies on payment processor partners to store account information.
Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox Premium. With a subscription, users receive discounted Robux along with access to exclusive or discounted items in the Avatar Marketplace. Developers may also choose to offer additional benefits to active Premium subscribers in the form of discounted virtual merchandise or access to exclusive in-experience features.
Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. The payout system is designed to protect against fraud and computes a developer’s revenue share on a daily basis. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences.
Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program. All Developer Exchange Program requests are reviewed on a risk-based approach to mitigate fraud and money laundering. Developers and creators participating in the program are required to create an account with Tipalti, our partner which collects tax information, ensures regulatory compliance, and executes the payouts.
Safety
Multiple systems are integrated into the Roblox Platform to promote civility and ensure the safety of our users. These systems are designed to enforce our policies, protect users’ personal information, and abide by local laws. We leverage text-filtering, content moderation systems, and automated systems to proactively identify behaviors that may violate our policies.
Content submitted by developers and creators, including images, models, meshes, and audio, goes through a multi-step review process before appearing on the platform. Images are evaluated for Child Sexual Abuse Material, or CSAM, using PhotoDNA with flagged images automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC. Audio files are scanned for IP infringement using Audible Magic. Finally, assets which have not already been flagged for removal are subject to a 100% human review policy. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our human review team evaluated over 140 million assets. Assets refer to images, meshes, audio files, and video files that developers upload to Roblox to include in their experiences.
When experiences are published or updated on the Roblox Platform, they are evaluated by a suite of tools that identify problematic language, potential bypasses to our chat filters, and content that falls outside our policies. A human review team is continuously operating to evaluate flagged experiences. The Roblox Platform includes a suite of anti-intruder technology leveraging machine learning, throttles, and circuit breakers to block automated bot attacks and mitigate the impact of humans who attempt to spam users and disrupt the service. We also leverage automated penetration testing, a bug bounty program, code threat assessments, and vulnerability to management tools to ensure the safety of our users and the platform.
Roblox operates a customer service portal that profiles self-help information along with ways to contact Roblox via email or from within the Roblox Client. In the year ended December 31, 2021, Roblox responded to over 13 million customer inquiries and had a human respond to actionable safety issues generally within 10 minutes of their submission on average.
Safety and Digital Civility
We aspire to build a safe and civil online society. We have no tolerance on our Platform for content or behavior that violates our rules. Safety and civility systems are built into our Platform and apply to every experience. In many instances, our systems extend beyond minimum regulatory requirements.
Our Platform is designed to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, regulations. We work closely with regulators, authorities, and safety groups in many countries. We endeavor to promptly report any suspected child exploitation or abuse materials to the relevant authorities.
We partner with over 20 leading global organizations focused on child and internet safety, including the WeProtect Global Alliance, Digital Wellness Lab, Family Online Safety Institute, or FOSI, UK Safer Internet Centre, and kidSAFE, among others. We are also a member of various organizations, such as the Association for United Kingdom Interactive Entertainment, or Ukie, and the Technology Coalition, with a goal of cross-industry collaboration, knowledge and technology exchange in areas of user safety, and child safety. For example, we worked with Microsoft on a cross-industry initiative to identify child safety issues. As a member of the Technology Coalition, we are committed to providing transparency and promoting child safety online. We continue to work diligently with other digital platforms to report bad actors and inappropriate content so that they can also take appropriate actions on their platforms.
Our Trust & Safety Systems
We use machine scanning and a dedicated team of human moderators to review content, including images, sound, and video, uploaded into our Platform. Our advanced machine scanning algorithms also review and monitor communications that flow through Roblox to block and protect users from inappropriate behavior, such as questions about personal information and instructions on how to connect on less protective third-party chat applications. The algorithms in our chat filters are age-sensitive: they monitor both what users can say and see based on their ages.
Throughout our site and in-experience, we provide our users with the ability to report activity that they find objectionable. Users can also block or mute players with whom they don’t want to interact. We also provide parents with customizable parental controls to limit or disable online chat or to restrict access to a curated list of age appropriate experiences.
We have a dedicated team and thousands of trust & safety agents protecting our users by focusing on detecting inappropriate content 24/7 through a combination of machine scanning and human moderation. We take swift action to address any content or developer or creator that violates our terms of use once detected. We have a Safety Advisory Board, made up of global industry experts that advise on the best practices to protect our community.
We continue to invest in technology and people to combat bad actors who attempt to undermine our efforts to connect millions of people. Our priority remains the safety and digital civility of our community.
The Roblox Economy
We support our developer and creator community by giving them the tools to build, publish, operate, and monetize content. Our economy enables developers and creators to generate income through Roblox. There were nearly 1.7 million developers and creators who earned Robux on the Roblox Platform in the month ending December 31, 2021, of which approximately 7,000 developers qualified for and were registered in our Developer Exchange Program and therefore met certain conditions, such as having earned at least 100,000 Robux, having a verified developer account, and having an account in good standing, and were therefore eligible to exchange their earned Robux for real-world currency. Of such developers and creators, for the year ended December 31, 2021, over 5,500 actually exchanged their earned Robux for real-world currency through our Developer Exchange Program. For the same period, there were over 2,200 developers and creators that earned $10,000 or more and over 500 developers and creators that earned $100,000 or more in Robux.
Business Model
When users sign up for Roblox, they can create an avatar and explore the vast majority of our experiences for free, although the business model for any given experience is ultimately up to its developer. Most free experiences allow users to spend Robux by purchasing experience-specific enhancements. Users can also use Robux to purchase items such as clothing, accessories and emotes, from our Avatar Marketplace. Roblox retains a portion of every Robux transaction and distributes the rest to developers and creators. Robux can only be purchased from us at a price set by us, and can only be spent within our Platform. Other than daily and monthly limitations to prevent fraud, there is no cap on the number of Robux that any user or users in the aggregate can purchase. Robux have no monetary or intrinsic value outside of our Platform and can only be converted to U.S. dollars through our Developer Exchange Program as described below. We are aware that some users seek to use unauthorized third-party websites to exchange Robux for real-world currency which is not permitted under our terms of use. We regularly monitor and screen usage of our Platform with the aim of identifying and preventing these activities, as well as regularly send cease-and desist letters to operators of third-party websites offering fraudulent Robux or digital good offers.
How Users Purchase Robux
Users can purchase Robux in two ways, as one-time purchases or via Roblox Premium, a subscription service that is billed monthly and includes discounted Robux, access to exclusive in-experience benefits, exclusive and discounted marketplace items and the ability to buy, sell and trade certain Avatar items. Roblox accepts payments through app stores, credit cards, and prepaid cards. The average price for a Robux for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.01.
How Developers and Creators Earn Robux
Robux are considered “earned” if a developer or creator receives them as payments for a bona fide third party transaction for virtual goods through the Roblox Platform. We currently offer developers and creators four mechanisms to earn Robux:
•sale of access to their experiences and enhancements in their experiences;
•engagement-based payouts, which reward developers for the amount of time that Premium subscribers spend in their experiences;
•sale of content and tools between developers; and
•sale of items to users through the Avatar Marketplace.
As users purchase and subsequently spend Robux on Roblox, developers receive 70% of the Robux spent within their experiences and 70% of the Robux spent for items that appear in the Studio Marketplace. Creators receive 30% of the Robux spent for their items that appear in the Avatar Marketplace.
Earned Robux are deposited into the virtual accounts of the developers and creators, who can convert Robux into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate which is determined by Roblox in its sole discretion of 1 Robux to $0.0035 as of December 31, 2021, if they qualify for and are registered in our Developer Exchange Program. Acceptance into the Developer Exchange Program is subject to certain requirements, such as earning at least 100,000 Robux, having a verified account, and having an account in good standing. In 2021, approximately 7,000 developers and creators that were qualified and registered in our Developer Exchange Program earned $538.3 million, up from over 4,300 of such developers and creators who earned $328.7 million in 2020.
Our developers and creators do not always cash out their Robux into real-world currency. Some choose to reinvest their Robux into developer tools from the Studio Marketplace, promote their experiences through our internal ad network, or spend the Robux as any other user would.
Our Growth Strategies
We are continually innovating the Roblox Platform, including making significant investments in high fidelity avatars, more realistic experiences, 3D spatial audio technology, and other social features. We believe that these innovations have the potential to transform how people express themselves, socialize, play, learn, work, and transact together around the world. We are focused on the following key growth strategies:
•Platform Extension: We believe the investments we are making to facilitate more immersive and engaging experiences on Roblox to expand our platform beyond play into new verticals such as brand partnerships, music and entertainment, and education. For example, in 2021, brands including Gucci, Nike, Chipotle, Warner Brothers launched their own experiences on the Roblox Platform, enabling them to connect and engage with audiences in an entirely new way. In addition, the Roblox Platform was used to host virtual concerts, listening parties and album launch parties with musical artists including 21 Pilots, Zara Larssen, and Poppy.
•Age Demographic Expansion: As a result of Roblox Platform innovations, developers, and creators are now able to build higher quality experiences and content that appeals to an older age demographic. We believe there is significant potential for us to increase our penetration and engagement across all age demographics. We ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages. An early sign of what is possible: DAUs from our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the year ended December 31, 2021.
•International Reach: We believe there is significant potential for us to grow the global reach of our Platform. We believe some of that will occur by the same organic, word of mouth user and developer growth that we have seen in markets like the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom. In addition, we are investing in technology that will also enhance our growth around the world. For example, we believe that features such as automated translation and built-in regional compliance will enable us to scale usage in global markets, allowing developers to publish in multiple languages and allowing users to communicate with each other even when they speak different languages.
•Monetization: We believe there is significant potential to increase monetization on our Platform. First, we are actively working with our developer and creator community to help them improve their monetization. Second, we believe Roblox Premium, our subscription service will increase our conversion of our free users to paying users and the retention of our paying users. Finally, we expect to work with leading brands to build unique commerce opportunities on the Roblox Platform.
Brand and Marketing
Our go-to-market approach is driven by the strength and continued enhancement of our brand, organic adoption across our user, creator and developer communities, and an influencer-based marketing strategy. We primarily rely on our owned and earned channels and word of mouth to drive user acquisition. This strategy has continued to be integral to our growth to 45.5 million DAUs in the year ended December 31, 2021.
Users build a direct relationship with the Roblox brand by establishing a single identity and creating their social graph. Users are able to navigate across an integrated universe of experiences on our Platform and engage on the Platform with users in their social graph. We believe this approach helps to create a flywheel that brings new users to the Platform, and promotes loyalty and engagement.
We have millions of experiences to choose from on Roblox, and developers continue to build new experiences on the Platform and publish them daily. As experiences on the Platform grow in popularity, this success accrues to the Roblox brand and serves to draw in new audiences. Our approach is to amplify these experiences on both earned and owned channels which builds awareness and affinity for Roblox.
We believe safety is an integral and differentiating part of our brand. We have invested heavily in creating a safe and civil platform, which has allowed us to both grow and retain our user base.
We continue to enhance our brand through investment in products and experiences that complement those on our Platform today. We have been active in leveraging our IP outside of the Roblox Platform through toys and branded apparel as a means to celebrate our users and further enhance our brand awareness. We have also launched entertainment partnerships to build brand awareness and drive engagement on the Platform.
Highly Efficient Marketing Model
We operate a highly efficient marketing model. Our approach is almost entirely organic, with our user, creator and developer adoption driven by mutually reinforcing content and social network effects. We also leverage our influencer community to increase brand awareness and our reach across all age demographics.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed roughly 1,600 full time employees. In addition, we had thousands of trust & safety agents across the globe. In order to continue to evolve the Roblox Platform, we must continue to invest heavily in attracting and retaining key talent, especially those focused on product and engineering. We monitor our progress with human capital metrics such as turnover, time to fill open roles, ratio of internally developed talent to external hires, ratio of technical talent to overall employees and employee engagement. Our brand, market position, reputation for innovation, and developer and creator-centric culture support our ability to recruit best-in-class engineering talent. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,190 employees in product and engineering functions, accounting for 75%, and 124 of our employees are located outside of the U.S.
We operate Roblox as a portfolio of small vision aligned teams. Each team maintains their own objectives, roadmap, and key performance indicators. Organizing this way maximizes accountability, creativity, and the number of leadership opportunities.
We have embraced four core values since we founded Roblox and focus on incorporating them into our daily actions:
•Respect the Community. We put the needs of our community above our own.
•Take the Long View. We incorporate our long-term goals in every decision.
•Take Responsibility. We drive execution by solving problems along with flagging issues.
•Get Stuff Done. We have a bias toward action.
In addition, in 2021, we launched new programs to benefit our employees. 
•Wellbeing Benefits: We invest heavily in our employees’ wellbeing by providing access to holistic benefits such as Carrot (fertility and family forming), Ginger (mental and behavioral health), Headspace (meditation and mindfulness), Physera (unlimited physical therapy), Aaptiv (fitness classes), Rightway (healthcare concierge and support), and One Medical (primary care and virtual care).
•Charitable Giving Matching: Roblox Giving is our charitable giving matching gift program that supports the generosity of our employees and doubles their social impact in local communities. Roblox will match contributions from eligible employees, dollar for dollar, up to $15,000 USD ($20,000 CAD) per contributor per year, to eligible organizations.
•401(k) Matching and Additional After-Tax: We invest heavily in our employee’s financial wellbeing through 401(k) matching. Our plan matches 100% of the first 3% deferred and 50% of the next 2% deferred. All 401(k) matching contributions are immediately vested.
We also allow employees to contribute to an Additional After-Tax 401(k) plan for employees who want to save above and beyond the normal annual IRS deferral limit.
•Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP: We have a generous ESPP benefit with a 24-month lookback period that allows an employee to invest in our growth.
•Employee Resource Groups: Our Employee Resource Groups, or ERGs, were created in order to promote and support diversity, inclusion and equity. Our ERGs are inclusive, voluntary, employee-led and executive sponsored groups whose aim is to foster a diverse, inclusive workspace. They include groups for women, racial and ethnic minorities, and people who identify as LGBTQIA+.
Finally, we have seen a wide range in how people have experienced working from home this past year, and we care a great deal for every employee’s well-being. We designed our 2021 Spring, Summer, and Winter Recharge Breaks as time for our entire Company to take a moment to breathe and recharge.
China Joint Venture
In February 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Songhua, an affiliate of Tencent Holdings Ltd., a leading internet company in China and one of the world’s largest gaming companies, to create Roblox China Holding Corp. (in which we hold a 51% ownership interest and Songhua holds a 49% interest). The joint venture operates through a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Shenzhen, China, named Roblox (Shenzhen) Digital Science and Technology Co., Ltd and branded “Luobu.” Through Luobu, Roblox and Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Co. Ltd or Tencent, will work together with the goal of building a successful localized version of Roblox in China that will leverage the strength of each party. Tencent currently intends to publish and operate a localized version of the Roblox Client as a game in China under the brand name “Luobulesi.” In December 2020, Tencent received a required publishing license from the National Press and Publication Administration of the Chinese government. The issuance of this publishing license follows a review of the content of Luobulesi to confirm that such content is not in contravention with the requirements of Chinese law. The localized version of the Roblox Client, Luobulesi, is not currently being offered to users in China. Luobu is continuing to focus on creating opportunities for local Chinese developers to learn a localized version of Roblox Studio for building and publishing experiences and content on our global Platform.
Competition
We compete for both users, developers, and creators. We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention on the basis of our content and user experiences. We compete for users and their engagement hours with global technology leaders such as Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent, global entertainment companies such as Comcast, Disney, and ViacomCBS, global gaming companies such as Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Valve, Unity, and Zynga, online content platforms including Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, as well as social platforms such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Snap. We are able to compete for these users based on our variety of content, personalized user experience, and various engaging and social features.
We rely on developers and creators to create the content that leads to and maintains user engagement (including maintaining the quality of experiences). We compete to attract and retain developers and creators by providing developers and creators the free tools to easily build, publish, operate, and monetize content. We compete for developers, creators and engineering talent with gaming platforms such as Epic Games, Unity, and Valve Corporation, who provide developers and creators the ability to create or distribute interactive content. We are able to compete for these developers and creators because of our comprehensive offering to build, publish, and operate experiences on our Platform, our free and easy-to-use technology, our broad user reach, our economic rewards system, our brand, our reputation for innovation, our developer and creator-centric culture, and our mission.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonality in monetization on our Platform and tend to generate higher levels of bookings in the fourth quarter of the year due in large part to the end-of-year holiday season. While bookings are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, this trend may not be reflected in the revenue recognized in the same period due to our revenue recognition methodology. The significant user and monetization growth, along with COVID-19 impact, have partially masked these trends in recent historical periods, particularly in 2020, and the seasonal impacts may be more pronounced in the future or different altogether.
Security, Privacy, Data Protection and Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, security, rights of publicity, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, credit card processing, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or securities law compliance or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country or state to state and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations are high and likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows and our geographic scope expands. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. It is imperative that we secure the creative assets, performance and user data that are critical to our business. We devote considerable resources to our security program and regularly test the security of our services with the intent to ensure that user assets are securely stored and separated. We make it easy for content developers and creators to securely build and distribute their content on our Platform.
We rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or the DMCA, the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the fair-use doctrine in the U.S., and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the EU. However, each of these statutes is subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. In addition, pending or recently adopted legislation in the EU may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by users to our Platform. If the rules, doctrines or currently available defenses change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply protections similar to those that are currently available in the U.S. or the EU, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our service, we could be required to expend significant resources to try to comply with the new rules or incur liability, and our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed.
We are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, including with respect to the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of the sale of personal information. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters in November 2020 and will go into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA would significantly modify the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states. Aspects of the CCPA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation, and other laws and regulations may be more restrictive and burdensome. For example, GDPR imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance. Under GDPR, fines up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations. In addition, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, struck down the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program, which was used by 5,000 companies to transfer data from the EU to the U.S. The court ruling also suggested that the propriety of Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, which are an alternate method of data transfer from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the U.S., may be challenged in the future. On September 8, 2020, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield did not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S. pursuant to Swiss data protection law. In June 2021, reflecting GDPR and the CJEU’s ruling with respect to the SCCs, the European Commission issued two new sets of SCCs, which will need to replace all existing SCCs by December 2022. The evolving regulatory landscape internationally results in uncertainty and could require us to incur additional costs and expenses to comply.
Children’s privacy has also been a focus of recent enforcement activity and subjects our business to potential liability that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorney generals in the U.S. have in recent years increased enforcement of COPPA, which requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain processing of the personal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on the country) without parental consent. The CCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California under the age of 16 (or parental consent for children under the age of 13) before selling their personal information. In the U.K., the Age Appropriate Design Code, or the AADC, came into effect in September 2021. Actual or perceived noncompliance with the AADC may result in audits or other proceedings by the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner Office, the body set up to uphold information rights in the United Kingdom, and other regulators in the EEA or Switzerland, as noncompliance with the AADC may indicate noncompliance with applicable data protection law. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, we may in the future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, the AADC, or other laws or actual or asserted obligations relating to children’s privacy. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us if enacted in the future.
We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other measures designed to protect our data, including data pertaining to our users, employees and business partners. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data.
Non-compliance with any applicable laws and regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Government authorities outside the U.S. may also seek to restrict access to or block our Platform, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our Platform or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our Platform in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content. Our privacy policy and terms and conditions of use describe our practices concerning, the use, transmission, and disclosure of user information and are posted on our website.
Our privacy policy and terms and conditions of use describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of user information and are posted on our website. For additional information, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Generally—If the security of our Platform is compromised, it could compromise our and our users’, developers’, and creators’ proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our platform, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Generally—We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulations—Because we store, process, and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could significantly harm our business.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and our success depends in part on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, contractual provisions, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned more than 70 U.S. patents relating to aspects of our actual or contemplated operations and technologies. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2040. We also had more than 130 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. There can be no assurance that each of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent. In addition, any resulting issued patents may have claims narrower than those in our patent applications. We seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business through patent protection; however, we are not dependent on any particular patent or application for the operation of our business.
We have registered “Roblox,” “Robux,” and our corporate logo as trademarks in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. In total, we are the owner of over 375 trademark filings and have over 70 trademark applications in the U.S. and foreign countries as of December 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that each of our trademark applications will result in the issuance of a trademark or that each resulting trademark registration will be able to be maintained. As of December 31, 2021, we were the registered holder of 286 domestic and international domain names. We continually monitor the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and in certain locations outside the U.S.
Despite our efforts, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient protection for or successfully enforce our intellectual property. Any current and future patents, trademarks and other intellectual property or other proprietary rights we own or license, or otherwise have a right to use may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid. Our existing and future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages, distinguish our products from those of our competitors or prevent competitors from launching comparable products. We may also be dependent on third-party content, technology and intellectual property in connection with our business. Further, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, diluting or otherwise misappropriating or violating our intellectual property rights, and we may face challenges to the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We cannot guarantee that our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the rights of third parties. We expect to continue to face allegations from third parties, including our competitors and “non-practicing entities,” that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. While we do not anticipate that these allegations, if they were to result in litigation against us, would have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results, there can be no guarantee that such lawsuits would not have a materially adverse impact on us. Further, certain federal statutes in the U.S. may apply to us with respect to various activities of our users, including the DMCA, provides immunity from monetary damages for online service providers such as us from, among other things, infringing content uploaded to our Platform by our users provided we comply with certain statutory requirements. The immunity is part of a statutory safe harbor. To enjoy the benefits of the safe harbor and be immune from monetary damages for infringing content uploaded by our users, we have to register a designated agent with the U.S. Copyright Office and maintain that filing on a periodic basis with the U.S. Copyright Office. We must also expeditiously remove any infringing content upon acquiring actual knowledge of such infringement or, in the absence of actual knowledge, if we become aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. We must also adopt and reasonably implement, and inform users of our Platform, of a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of users who are repeat infringers of the copyrights of third parties. If we fail to comply with the conditions for qualifying for safe harbor protection, we may be subject to monetary damages for infringing content on our Platform. The damages for copyright infringement can range from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed and, in the case of willful infringement, up to $150,000 per work infringed. Alternatively, copyright owners could seek to recover their actual damages and our profits. As we host millions of user uploaded works, we could be subject to significant damages claims if we are determined not to comply with the DMCA safe harbors. Intellectual property disputes are common in our sector and, as we face increasing competition or grow our business, there is an ongoing risk that we may become involved in legal disputes involving intellectual property claims. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our intellectual property.
For additional information on risks relating to intellectual property, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement would harm our business,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—We use open source software on our Platform and in connection with certain experiences on our Platform, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and could have a negative impact on our business.”
