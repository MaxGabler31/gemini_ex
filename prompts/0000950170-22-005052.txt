Item 1.
Business
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the business of Spire and its subsidiaries.
Overview
 We are a global provider of space-based data, analytics and space services, offering unique datasets and powerful insights about Earth from the ultimate vantage point—space—so that organizations can make decisions with confidence, accuracy and speed. We own and operate one of the world’s largest multi-purpose satellite constellations in low earth orbit. Our fully deployed constellation consists of over 100 satellites, and we believe it is also one of the world’s largest “listening” constellations, observing the earth utilizing radio frequency sensors. We enrich this hard-to-acquire, valuable data with analytics and predictive solutions, providing data as a subscription to organizations around the world so that they can improve business operations, decrease their environmental footprint, deploy resources for growth and competitive advantage and mitigate risk.
In December 2021, our satellite constellation covered the earth over 200 times per day on average and our global ground station network performed over 2,300 contacts each day on average, reliably and resiliently collecting data with low latency. Our cloud-based data infrastructure processed five terabytes of data each day on average in December 2021, in creating our proprietary data analytics solutions. We provide customers these solutions through an application programming interface (“API”) infrastructure that delivers approximately one terabyte of data each day to our customers, as of December 31, 2021. The global data we collect includes data that can only be captured from space with no terrestrial alternatives. We collect this data once and can then sell it an unlimited number of times across a broad and growing set of industries, including weather, aviation and maritime, with global coverage, real-time and near real-time data that can be easily integrated into our customers’ operations.
 From our founding in 2012, we have set out to leverage data from space to solve problems on Earth. We aim to help inspire, lead, and innovate the business of space-based data. Today, our proprietary data and solutions are being used to help commercial and government organizations gain the advantage that they seek to innovate and solve some of the world’s greatest challenges, like climate change. We have experienced rapid organic and inorganic growth in recent periods. In November 2021, we acquired exactEarth, a leading provider of global maritime vessel data for ship tracking and maritime situational awareness solutions in Canada.
 Our Data Solution Offerings
 
Our proprietary constellation of low Earth multi-use receiver (“LEMUR”) satellites collects and transmits data to our proprietary global ground station network. The data is then autonomously moved from ground stations to proprietary data warehouses for cleansing, standardization, fusion and analysis. Via the SpireSight API, our customers receive proprietary data, analysis, and predictive solutions delivered seamlessly in near real-time.
 We collect data from space once and can sell it an unlimited number of times without added cost. The four forms of data we sell to customers are:
 •Clean data: Clean and structured data directly from our proprietary satellites;
 •Smart data: Clean data fused with third-party datasets and proprietary analysis to enhance value and provide insights;
 •Predictive data: Big data, AI, and ML algorithms applied to fused data sets to create predictive analytics and insights; and
 •Solutions: Data-driven actionable recommendations to solve specific business problems, utilizing the full spectrum of our data analytics suite.
 

Key elements of our data platform include:
 •All-in-one: Our data platform provides a unified view of robust, deep data sets that are accessed from multiple data sources, globally. 
 Through this single view, users are able to gain better insight and make informed decisions;

 •Cloud-based data analytics: We have developed data processing and analytics systems which are used to process the data produced by its sensors, combine it with third-party data, and provide predictive analytics solutions for our customers.
 We monetize our proprietary solutions across a broad and growing range of current and target industries including agriculture, logistics, financial services, insurance, aerospace, energy, fishing, academia and real estate, among others. The largest industries we currently serve include maritime, aviation and government (civil and defense).
 
Maritime
 
We provide current and historical data, insights and predictive analytics for highly accurate ship monitoring, real-time vessel updates, port operations, ship safety and route optimization. We leverage the International Maritime Organization automatic identification systems ("AIS") standard, which is an automatic tracking system that uses transceivers on ships to provide geographic location data through historical or live satellite AIS (“S-AIS”) data as observed by our satellites and terrestrial AIS (“T-AIS”) data from third party sensor stations. Dynamic AIS (D-AIS) combines three types of AIS data to provide greater vessel tracking data in high traffic zones. Our AIS-based maritime solutions increase global maritime domain awareness, facilitate coastline policing, and provide greater ocean coverage. Key applications include:
 •Tracking vessels globally: Precise vessel tracking using AIS data helps owners and operators know where vessels are located. Customers can run queries by Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI), vessel name, call signs, AIS class type and more.
 •Supply chain and port operations: Expected time of arrival and vessel tracking data enables shippers, third party logistic companies and ports to optimize routes, minimize delays and time at port, plan berths and orchestrate last mile delivery.
 •Optimizing fuel efficiencies: Smart route planning, identification of busy shipping lanes, weather forecasts and port selection enable customers to effectively manage fuel costs.
 •Monitoring illegal activities and compliances: Real-time solutions help facilitate organizations to secure fishing territories, protect underwater infrastructure and analyze maritime incidents.
 •Analyzing commodity trading: Fuel, grain, building materials and precious metals are all traded by sea. We constantly track what, where and by whom such commodities are being traded. We use location data and maritime intelligence in combination with trade data to visualize the global commodity flow and identify patterns.
 In November 2021, we acquired exactEarth, a leading provider of global maritime vessel data for ship tracking and maritime situational awareness solutions that was mainly based out of Canada.
 In December 2021, our proprietary technology collected 283 million AIS messages daily on average.
 Aviation
 We provide global satellite-based aircraft tracking data to power applications, drive decision making and improve cost efficiencies. We utilize International Civil Aviation Organization-backed ADS-B aircraft tracking data to provide a near real-time precision and situational awareness. Using ADS-B, customers can track the overall operational status of aviation assets and relevant weather conditions along a given aircraft’s flight path or in particular areas of interest around the world. Our versatile datasets include historical and near real-time aircraft position and status, aircraft type and airline data, flight and airport information, delivered via our near real-time and historical data APIs. Our satellites capture global aircraft movements from space using ADS-B signals, even when the aircraft is flying over oceans, deserts, mountains and regions without available ground-based tracking.
•Flight tracking: We generate near real-time information on the movements of all ADS-B equipped aircrafts across continents and oceans for a long suite of regulatory and operations applications;
 •Estimated time of arrival/on-time performance: Our versatile, near real-time aviation ADS-B data streams provide insight into both historical on-time performance and real-time estimated time of arrivals;


•Overflight fee: National aviation authorities charge overflight fees to operators of aircraft that fly in their airspace, but neither take off nor land in the country. Our easy to integrate APIs allow automatic detection and aid in fee administration;
 •Air cargo and freight analytics: Tracking all cargo aircraft in near real-time can be leveraged for analysis of supply of air cargo capacity which aids in optimizing pricing and distribution;
 •Analytics and market intelligence: Companies integrate live and historical flight and weather data into innovative solutions for their customers and internal teams, driving more favorable outcomes through deeper insights; and
 •Predictive maintenance and aircraft management: By tracking aircraft usage and flight patterns, our data aids in the analysis allowing for less aircraft downtime and fewer schedule disruptions.
 In December 2021, we collected 368 million ADS-B messages daily on average.
 Weather
 
We provide space-based data, AI-powered insights and predictive weather analytics to empower the world to optimize costs, increase safety, boost decarbonization and make optimal business decisions. By utilizing radio occultation technology (“RO”), we are able to offer global and precise weather monitoring capabilities, capturing detailed temperature, humidity, and pressure information across the entire planet. Our extensive low-orbit satellite constellation collects near real-time data from every layer of the atmosphere, even at traditionally difficult high and low altitude ranges. Our constellation delivers global access to a specialized global observation dataset and delivers accuracy, previously only available locally and in well-developed regions. These tools provide immense value to governments, companies and individuals across the world, including the following sample of applications:
 •Asset protection: Our data can help facilitate the protection of physical assets like power lines from storm damage;
 •Crop yields: Customers can use our solutions to help to optimize crop yields with optimal farm operations;
 •Local weather forecasting: Taking exact measurements around the world helps improve local forecasts since weather systems connect globally and can provide emergency management professionals and search and rescue teams with highly detailed forecasting across their operational regions; 
 •Reducing losses and insurance: Provision of data can decrease losses related to inclement weather and provide enhanced customer experiences in insurance, and
 •Minimize supply chain disruptions: Reduce risks to cargo, ship and crew safety, optimize fuel consumption and manage operational costs with hyper-accurate weather forecasts for maritime, aviation and ground operations.
 In December 2021, our constellation collected approximately 20,000 RO profiles daily on average.
 Space Services
 We leverage our fully deployed, at-scale space, ground and cloud infrastructure, our proven, low-risk development lifecycle and proprietary infrastructure to provide our Space Services solution, which takes full advantage of our space heritage, vertically integrated capabilities and global space infrastructure to revolutionize how customers access space. Akin to cloud-based services like Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, we provide customers fast, scalable and reliable access to space data at a fraction of the cost and time it historically took by leveraging the same operational infrastructure we use for our own data and analytics solutions across maritime, aviation and weather. In doing so, customers are able to convert high capital expenditures typically recognized at the outset into affordable and recurring operating expenditures though a flexible subscription-based pricing model. Our consistent launch schedule and end-to-end LEMUR design and manufacturing process allow customer sensors to go from design to launch in a matter of months, as opposed to three to five years–common under legacy satellite development.
 Our customers can deploy their own applications and sensors into space quickly and efficiently with our diverse offerings:
 •Software in Space: Deploy customer software to existing satellites, using Software Defined Radios (SDR) in space without the need to launch a dedicated spacecraft.
 •Payload in Space: Host customer payloads on trusted, fully-integrated space, ground and web platform.
 •Solutions in Space: Customers partner with Spire to build a custom end-to-end solution.
 Our Technology Platform
 Our Constellation
 We operate a large constellation of LEMUR nanosatellites along with a global network of ground stations. By operating our own satellites and ground stations, we are able to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data and make them available to our customers.
 Key elements of our constellation include:


•Proprietary Satellite Space Platform: We have developed a configurable nanosatellite platform called LEMUR, which is used to deploy data- generating sensors into space and provide all necessary resources for them to be operated efficiently, including power, pointing, data communications and onboard processing. As of December 31, 2021, the LEMUR platform has accumulated over 300 years of space flight heritage, with over 145 nanosatellites deployed in over 30 unique configurations. LEMUR is compatible with a significant number of available launch vehicles, having completed more than 30 launch campaigns on nine unique vehicles.
 •Software-defined radio frequency sensors: We have developed a number of software-defined-radio based sensors, including AIS receivers, ADS-B receivers, and GNSS radio occultation (GNSS-RO) receivers. These sensors are used to produce the proprietary datasets used in our data and analytics solutions.
 •Ground station network: We have deployed and operate a network of more than 30 ground stations distributed around the globe. These ground stations allow seamless communications between LEMUR nanosatellite platforms (and their hosted sensors) and our cloud-based operations and data processing system.
 •Supercomputing power in-orbit: We have launched supercomputing power in-orbit, which supports up to one teraflop of computing performance. 
 •Automated operations system: We have developed a cloud-based automated operations system, which allows us and users of our Space Services solution to operate sensors hosted on the LEMUR nanosatellite platform seamlessly through a web-based API. The operations system includes proprietary optimization algorithms which allow coordinated operations of multiple satellites, enabling us and our Space Services users to scale operations of constellations efficiently.
 Industry Background
 We believe technological advancements and the rapid pace of innovation continue to drive the commercialization of spaced-based data, analytics, and insights, making them more relevant to businesses, governments and to the public at large. Furthermore, we believe that the demand for data that can be collected from space is growing rapidly, while the cost of access to space is falling. Key trends in the new space economy include the growth in the number of constellations and the availability of space-based data, the shift in user demand from data toward analytics and insights, climate change adaptation, and advancements in on-board technologies.
 Growth in the number of constellations and the availability of data
 
One of the biggest drivers of growth in our industry has been the growth in the number of satellites orbiting the earth and the increasing amounts of data being made available by them. Satellites continue to evolve into smaller forms, as small as a breadbox or even as tiny as a mobile phone subscriber identification module (“SIM”), with significant capabilities. These smaller satellites are less expensive to build and easier to launch than legacy satellites. These small satellite constellations are disrupting the space industry due to their rapid pace of innovation (aligned with a 10-fold improvement in capability per kilogram every five years), deployment cycles and lower cost to deploy in orbit.
Shift in user demand from data to analytics
 
Users are increasingly demanding not only data, but also analytics and insights. Advancements in technologies such as big data and cloud-based processing allow for massive amounts of data to be not only stored, but also analyzed in real-time, providing users with faster, more meaningful data, analytics and insights. Artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and the application of specified algorithms continue to improve insights and predictive analytics.
 Climate change response
 
The response to the world’s problem of global warming and climate change over the past several decades has been largely focused on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. More recently, there has been a growing realization that the world lacks sufficient tools to anticipate and respond effectively to extreme weather events and climate change, and that more of our efforts and investment should be focused on how we can best protect vulnerable populations, infrastructure, land and the impact to the global economy. We believe that more accurate weather data, prediction technologies and analytics will play an increasingly important role in helping to devise strategies to maintain water quality and availability, modify land use, protect and preserve coastal land and development, manage stormwater logistics, mitigate the spread of wildfires, repair and retrofit vulnerable facilities and maximize the use of green infrastructure.
 Advancements in on-board technologies
 Rapid innovation in space technology infrastructure, including communication devices and sensors, has improved data download times and spatial resolution and measurement accuracies, allowing for better space-based data, analytics and insights to be delivered faster.

Before space-based data, legacy solutions were often burdened with substantial shortcomings in terms of coverage and safety. For instance, before the advent of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (“ADS-B”), aviation stakeholders were blind to the vast majority of global aerospace activity, as terrestrial-based solutions were unable to track aircraft over oceans. This occasionally resulted in tragedies like that of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in March 2014 while flying a routine route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. As of December 2021, our sensors covered the entirety of the globe over 200 times per day on average, including remote areas where terrestrial automatic identification system (“AIS”), ADS-B and atmospheric weather information are out of reach.

The introduction of intersatellite links has been a game changer for the industry. Our constellation already has radio frequency links (RF links) in-orbit and we have begun testing optical intersatellite links (“optical ISLs”). The effective rollout of this technology throughout our constellation will create a mesh network

in a similar way to how personal computers were linked with one another through the internet. Optical ISLs will enable us to deliver more data faster and in an even more secure way to our customers.
Lastly, the compute power on-board satellites in-orbit continues to improve. Spire launched its first supercomputer in-orbit with a teraflop of data processing capability in October 2020 and has iterated on the technology since to meet the needs of space services customers and enhance the data solutions delivered to customers.
 Sales and Marketing

Our innovation and focused execution have allowed us to quickly extend our network and our reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand within our existing industries and enter new industries and geographies in the future. However, we could face significant risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations as a result of competition. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Spire—We face intense competition and could face pricing pressure from, and lose market share to, our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property protection for our technology, inventions, improvements, proprietary rights, and other assets. We seek to accomplish that objective by establishing intellectual property rights in and protecting those assets through a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures. As of December 31, 2021, we have 25 issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, no pending U.S. provisional patent applications, one issued non-U.S. patent and two pending non-U.S. patent applications (one of which is an allowed Canadian Application). Our issued U.S. patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending applications, are scheduled to expire at dates ranging between February 1, 2033 and November 4, 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we owned six registered trademarks in the United States, no pending trademark applications in the United States, 21 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions and no pending trademark applications in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also license data and software from third parties for integration into our business, including open-source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
 Additionally, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limiting access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our offerings or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and time consuming. Third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. The laws, procedures and restrictions on which we rely may provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
 Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property against us or our customers, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. In addition to competitive base salaries and cash compensation, the principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 370 employees based out of eight offices located in five countries, of which 269 were full-time employees. In addition, we engage contractors and third-party service providers in connection with certain projects. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Government Regulation and Compliance
 Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing laws and regulations related to the deployment and operation of satellites, ground stations, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, investment screening, labor and employment, worker classification, product safety, economic sanctions, anti-trust laws, anti-money laundering laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.
 Our business requires licenses and permits from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and review by other agencies of the U.S. Government. License approval can include an interagency review of safety, operational, radio frequency interference, national security, foreign policy and international obligations implications, as well as a review of foreign ownership. We must also comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal governmental organizations, which affect how we do business with governmental agencies.
 Selling our services to the U.S. government also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. In addition, we maintain similar licenses and permits in Luxembourg, Singapore and other jurisdictions that impose regulatory and operational requirements.
 Our launch and operation of planned satellites may require regulatory authorizations from the FCC or a non-U.S. licensing jurisdiction. Obtaining launch windows for planned satellites and ground stations, preparing for launch and working with the requisite equipment in foreign jurisdictions may require coordination with U.S. and foreign regulators. It is not uncommon for licenses for new satellites or additional operational parameters to be granted just prior to launch, and we expect to receive such licenses for all planned satellites. If we do not obtain required authorizations in the future, we will not be able to operate

our planned satellites. If we obtain a required authorization but do not meet milestones regarding the construction, launch and operation of a satellite by deadlines that may be established in the authorization, we may lose our authorization to operate a satellite using certain frequencies in an orbital location. Any authorizations we obtain may also impose operational restrictions or permit interference that could affect our use of planned satellites.
 We hold FCC and foreign governmental licensing authority licenses, permits and approvals for its satellite constellations and earth stations. As we build out our satellite constellation, we will require new licenses, permits and approvals from the FCC and/or foreign governmental licensing authorities or modifications to existing licenses, permits and approvals. Changes to its satellite constellation and earth stations may also require prior approval from the FCC or other governmental authorities. These modifications or changes may take time: for example, the FCC typically processes satellite applications for new orbital locations or frequencies on a first come, first served basis. From time to time, we may have pending applications for permanent or temporary changes in frequencies and technical design. From time to time, we have filed or will need to file applications to replace or add satellites to our satellite constellation. These licenses, permits, and approvals are also subject to modification by the FCC and foreign government licensing authorities. In addition, our licenses, permits and approvals require coordination with various entities, including other federal government agencies.
 Our business is also dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”). These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radiocommunication Conference. Each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country. In the United States, the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
 Any ITU or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our services and have significant negative impacts on our customers, both of which could reduce demand for our business. We are licensed to uplink and downlink our data over certain bands. Other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our business as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our services.
 In many cases, our data, services, and technology are or may in the future be subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and International Traffic In Arms (“ITAR”), and subject to trade and economic sanctions maintained by Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We are also subject to or may in the future be subject to export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations in the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom, Singapore and other jurisdictions in which we operate. As such, an export license may be required to export or re-export our data, services, and technology to certain countries or end-users, or for certain end-uses. Compliance with the EAR, ITAR and other applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our services, including new releases and/or the performance of services, may create delays in the introduction of our services in non-U.S. markets, prevent our customers with non-U.S. operations from deploying these solutions throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of the services to some countries altogether. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management attention. Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations. Further, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions as well as similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions prohibit the export of offerings to certain U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses.
 Our business is also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and international laws, directives, and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information and other data. The regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and data transfers worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. For example, the European Court of Justice in July 2020 struck down the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which provided companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the EU to the United States. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), impose obligations on us and on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the “CDPA”), continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory or operational burdens. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Complying with the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, CDPA, or other laws, regulations, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations and contractual or other actual or alleged obligations relating to privacy, data protection, data transfers, data localization or information security may require us to make changes to our services to enable us or our customers to meet new legal requirements, incur substantial operational costs, modify our data practices and policies and restrict our business operations.
 Our business is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, such as fuels and batteries, which may contain hazardous materials. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions, and third-party claims, as a result of violations of or in connection with liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.


For additional information regarding the laws and regulations to which we are subject and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Spire,” including the sections titled “Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations,” “Our ability to obtain or maintain licensing authorization for our platform is subject to government rules and processes which can cause delays or failures in obtaining authorizations requested. Further, regulators may adopt new rules and regulations which could impose new requirements impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we do not maintain regulatory authorizations for our existing satellites, associated ground facilities and terminals, services we provide, or obtain authorizations for our future satellites, associated ground facilities and terminals, and services we provide, we may not be able to operate our existing satellites or expand our operations,” “We are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and failure to secure spectrum use rights to support our operations and future technological development could impede our growth. Further, our platform may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses,” “We are subject to domestic and international governmental export and import controls that would impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws or if we do not secure or maintain the required export authorizations,” and “The rapidly evolving framework of privacy, data protection, data transfers, or other laws or regulations worldwide may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.”
