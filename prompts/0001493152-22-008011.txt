Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
The Company is an industry leader in CEA (Controlled Environment Agriculture) facility design, technologies, and services. The CEA industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the United States’ economy and is defined by type of facility. The CEA industry is composed of any horticultural facility that is fully self-contained and has a controlled environment. Three facility types meet these criteria:
 
● Indoor facilities – environmentally sealed facilities for growing crops and that require artificial lighting.
 
● Vertical farms –cultivation facilities oriented vertically to minimize ground square footage.
 
● Greenhouses – facilities that are made of translucent materials to use natural sunlight on the crops.
 
Crops grown in CEA facilities include: leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, mustard, cress), microgreens (leafy greens harvested at the first true leaf stage), ethnic vegetables, ornamentals and small fruits (such as strawberries, blackberries and raspberries), bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, cannabis and hemp. Historically, we have primarily served customers growing cannabis in indoor facilities and we are currently pursuing our strategy to broaden our reach to serve other indoor farming including vertical farms.
 
We provide full-service licensed architectural and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineering services, carefully curated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVACD”) equipment, proprietary controls systems, air sanitation, lighting, and benching and racking products. Our team (including both internal employees and outside partnerships) of project managers, licensed professional architects and engineers, technology and horticulture specialists and systems integrations experts help our customers by precisely designing for their unique applications. Through our partnership with a certified service contractor network, we provide maintenance services to assist in a smooth build-out and ensure optimal facility performance.
 
We leverage our industry-leading experience to bring value-added solutions to our customers that help improve their overall crop quality and yield, optimize energy and water efficiency, and satisfy evolving state and local construction code, permitting and regulatory requirements. Our revenue stream derives primarily from supplying our products, services and technologies to commercial indoor facilities ranging from several thousand to more than 100,000 square feet.
 
CEA facility operators face multiple headwinds from high energy costs, water usage and waste materials, and, in the case of cannabis growing, increasingly rigorous quality standards and declining cannabis prices. To be competitive, among other things, our customers must develop innovative ways to meet the demands of their business and reduce energy costs, 90% of which are typically related to their HVACD (50%) and lighting systems (40%). HVACD systems have historically been and continue to be our primary area of expertise and energy efficiency is high on our list of considerations when engineering environmental control systems.
 
We often have the advantage of early engagement with our customers at the pre-build and construction phases and the corresponding opportunity to build longer-term relationships with our existing customers. During 2021, we added architectural services to our offerings in an attempt to engage with the customer at an even earlier stage. Going forward, we plan to leverage our existing customer relationships by introducing them to our expanded design services along with our expanded product offerings. We believe these efforts will generate incremental revenue and make us “stickier” to our customers.

We have three core assets that we believe are important to our going-forward business strategy and that will contribute to our future growth. First, we have a well-known brand name in the industry along with multi-year relationships with customers and others developed over our fifteen years of service to the industry. This length of service and broad network of industry contacts will benefit not only our organic growth initiatives, but also provide us with unique insight into other industry providers who may be appropriate for acquisition or joint efforts. Second, we have specialized engineering know-how and experience gathered from designing environmental control systems for over 200 commercial CEA cultivation facilities. Third, we have an expanding line of proprietary and curated environmental control systems and other core technology components needed to build a CEA facility.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted national, regional, and local governments, including those in the markets that the Company operates in, to implement preventative or protective measures to control its spread. As a result, there have been disruptions in business operations around the world, with an impact on our business.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated government and business response, the Company took and continues to take measures to adjust its operations as necessary. In early 2020 the Company responded to reduced orders by reducing expenses in an effort to preserve cash. Many expenses, including travel, marketing, headcount, work hours, and compensation were reduced, deferred, or eliminated while still allowing us to meet our customer obligations and develop new business. As 2020 progressed and our sales rebounded, and we were able to obtain additional funds through a forgivable bank loan, we restored our workforce and compensation. Many of these expense reductions were reversed by the end of 2021 when orders picked up and the overall business climate improved. Because the pandemic continues in different parts of the world and in different ways in the United States, the Company continues to actively monitor its operations. 
 
We are experiencing unexpected and uncontrollable delays with our international supply of products and shipments from vendors due to a significant increase in shipments to U.S. ports, compounded by a reduction in cargo being shipped by air, a general shortage of containers, and a shortage of domestic truck driver availability. While these delays have moderately improved in recent months, we, along with many other importers of goods across all industries, continue to experience severe congestion and extensive wait times for carriers at ports across the United States. In addition, restrictions imposed by local, state and federal agencies due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced personnel of importers, government staff and others in our supply chain. We have been working diligently with our network of freight partners and suppliers to expedite delivery dates and provide solutions to reduce further impact and delays. However, we are unable to determine the full impact of these delays and how long they will continue as they are out of our control.
 
While the Company is continuing to navigate the financial, operational, and personnel challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, the potential uncertainty related to (and proliferation of) new strains, and related actions taken by federal, state, local and international government officials, to prevent and manage the spread of COVID-19. All of these efforts are uncertain, out of our control, and cannot be predicted at this time.
 
The CEA Industry
 
According to leading market research firms Headset and New Frontier Data, the North American cannabis industry is expected to experience compound annual growth on the order of 14%-15% from 2022 through 2025. More U.S. states are legalizing either medical or recreational use of cannabis products, and sometimes both. Although the market is aware of how the cannabis sector is growing, it seems to be less aware of the non-cannabis CEA market, particularly the vertical farming segment which is growing nearly as fast as the cannabis market. Since the technical infrastructure and requirements for growing any plant in a controlled environment are similar, we believe we can bring our engineering expertise and suite of products to this adjacent high growth market.

Service Solutions: Facility Design Services
 
Our outsourced licensed architectural services provide facility design and layout to include space and workflow optimization, construction documents, and construction administration. Our extensive experience with CEA facilities brings extra value to our customers as we advise them on the design of their facility to maximize its productivity and return on investment.
 
We have professional engineers (PEs) on our staff to provide licensed, professional Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) engineering services to all non-cannabis customers, and to cannabis customers that are in cannabis-legal states and provinces. Our engineers perform mechanical engineering, and we outsource electrical and plumbing engineering to several vendors with whom we have long-term, trusted relationships. We believe we are among the most experienced engineering firms serving the cannabis growing CEA industry and we have leading edge, sophisticated engineering capabilities. We provide these services to facilities from several thousand to over 100,000 square feet in size. Over time the size and sophistication of projects we have served has grown increasingly large, a trend we expect will continue as the industry builds ever larger facilities.
 
Our licensed MEP engineering services provide stamped drawings that our customers need to obtain building permits and to build their facilities and specify equipment, and we can provide these services in any state or province. Our technical experience and know-how in engineering indoor cultivation facilities allow us to deliver to our customers practical solutions to complicated problems in four primary areas: (i) precision climate and environmental controls, (ii) energy and water efficiency, (iii) building code and permitting, and (iv) construction support services and start-up support of their environmental control equipment. Our engineering design typically includes all mechanical components of a climate control system: cooling and heating, dehumidification, ventilation, air sanitation, and odor control. We provide load calculations, equipment specifications, and engineered systems drawings for both the cultivation and comfort cooling portions of our customers’ facilities. We also have experience in, or knowledge of, state and local permitting and code compliance for facilities in states and provinces where cannabis has been legalized for either recreational or medical use or is expected to be legalized, and we provide stamped, engineered drawings in all states and provinces where we operate. We provide a drawing package to our customers that allows them to obtain a building permit that is code compliant, identifies construction materials and alternates, and provides construction administration information for their general and sub-contractors to follow.
 
Service Solutions: Equipment Selection and Specification
 
Our goal as engineers is to identify the best technical solutions in the market and to offer a curated range of technologies to our customers to best meet the needs of their facilities. Our engineers assess each facility’s requirements and recommend the best equipment options for the customer without limitation or bias to a particular HVAC technology solution as we have access to all major HVAC system types and multiple vendors. Our product development and R&D groups search the market for the best technical solutions to offer our customers. We offer a wide range of the best products in the market.
Service Solutions: Equipment Installation Advisory
 
We do not offer construction services or perform equipment installation. Typically, a facility owner hires a general contractor (GC) to manage the project, and the GC hires sub-contractors in specific trades to conduct the installation of each sub-system, such as environmental control equipment. Our role in the construction process is to work with the GC and sub-contractors to provide the equipment that the customer has ordered at the required time and place. Then, during the construction process, our technical services employees are available to advise the construction contractors, and we conduct multiple site visits to ensure the quality of the installation.
Service Solutions: Start-up Services
 
After construction is completed, our technical services employees participate on-site to inspect the installation and to conduct startup of the systems that we have provided. When we are contracted for controls, we offer operator training for the facility personnel. After the facility is up and running, we provide support as needed to include site visits and to ensure that the facility is operating to its design specifications.

Service Solutions: Lifecycle Services
 
CEA facilities are technically sophisticated and require multiple sub-systems, including: environmental control, lighting, CO2 enrichment and control, water conditioning and reclamation, and fertigation/irrigation. We believe that facility operators will eventually want to focus on their core business of growing plants and not be distracted by the unrelated, but necessary and technical, work of maintaining these mission-critical sub-systems.
 
In the summer of 2021, we developed and began selling preventive maintenance (PM) services to meet this demand from our existing clients. Sold on a recurring subscription basis to existing cultivation facilities, the PM services are sold by us and are provided by third-party service companies located near the customer’s facility. We have partnered with a company that can provide this service across most of the geography where our customers and prospects are located. The PM services product is important for our business for three primary reasons. First, it provides recurring revenue. Second, it establishes a long-term relationship with the customer. Third, it offers the opportunity to be sold independently of our existing engineering offering and to any of the several thousand existing cultivation facilities.
 
Product Solutions.
 
We have historically been a provider of HVACD engineering and systems, and since 2019 we have broadened our product lines to now offer a wide range of products and infrastructure technologies. Because many different technologies are required to operate an indoor cultivation facility, our product strategy is to offer both proprietary (Surna Cultivation Technologies branded) and off the shelf products. Our proprietary products are made by us or vendors on a contract manufacturing basis to our specifications. We offer a curated selection of products and specify those that best meet the needs of our customers’ particular applications. Our product solutions can be divided into three categories.
 
Product Solutions: White-label environmental control products
 
Environmental Control Systems. We offer a broad range of HVACD technologies, to include chilled water systems, custom air handling units, split systems, and packaged roof-top units. We sell our proprietary products under the brand names Surna®, IsoStream®, EnviroPro™, EcoChill™, StrataAir™ and SentryIQ®. We have a national accounts relationship with Trane, and we resell their chillers under a joint label agreement. We also have a national accounts relationship with Anden, and we resell their dehumidifiers under a joint label agreement. During 2019, we launched upgraded, white-labeled equipment lines of fan coils and air handlers. In 2020 we introduced our first DX-based packaged systems. We offer various configurations of our Surna-branded fan coil units, which provide greater efficiency, design flexibility and control for growers using modular chilled water systems. This expanded product line allows us to serve customers across a wide range of application and budget requirements. We have chosen to offer white-label products for two reasons. First, we can design the products to our own specifications, using our accumulated knowledge to develop products that meet the particular and demanding challenges of indoor agriculture. Second, we can maintain better product margins by offering products that are proprietary to us and are not otherwise available to potential competitors.
 
Product Solutions: Proprietary Facility Control System
 
Sensing and Control Systems. In 2018 we began to develop, and in 2019 began to offer, a branded, proprietary controls and monitoring system (consisting of sensors, controllers, software, monitoring and a user interface). Branded as SentryIQ®, it is a sensors, controls and automation (“SCA”) platform—a turnkey, single-vendor HVACD equipment and controls integration solution to new build projects as well as existing facilities in the startup and operation phases. We have continued the rollout of SentryIQ® and to date we have entered into nineteen contracts to implement our SentryIQ® SCA platform. This product line is important for tactical and strategic reasons, and we hope to offer this as a standalone offering in the future. SentryIQ® is our highest-margin product.
 
Cultivation facilities must have SCA to operate their HVACD equipment. In simple form, SCA is the computerized thermostat in the room. The SCA also functions as the “brains” in bringing multiple variables together for CEA grow operations. The operator selects the desired temperature set point, the wall thermostat (Sensor) detects the actual temperature, and when the space temperature deviates from the desired set point the controller (Control) commands the environmental control components to supply heated, cooled, or dehumidified air to bring the room temperature back to the set point. In the case of indoor cultivation facilities, there are more environmental conditions to monitor and control (such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2, lighting, vapor pressure deficit status, and more) than in a typical residential home.

Indoor CEA growers also need to vary and tightly control environmental conditions depending on the stage of plant growth (i.e., clone, vegetative and flowering stages), the time of day, and the plant genetics. In a cultivation facility, the desired conditions change many times during the plant’s growth cycle and even within a day, and this is most easily accomplished with a custom design, computerized environmental control system (automation), similar to the most sophisticated building automation systems (BAS) found in commercial and process cooling applications. This control system may also command lighting and CO2 enrichment.
 
Our SentryIQ® SCA package includes precision sensors to measure temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 levels more accurately than typical HVACD sensors and within tighter tolerance levels. Our controllers are purpose-built computers programmed by us to ensure our industrial environmental control equipment follows the engineered sequences of operation to obtain desired set points. Our sensors connect to our branded controllers through wires installed in the facility, and similarly they are wired to our HVACD equipment (e.g., chillers, fan coils and dehumidifiers) to direct these pieces of equipment. The controllers also provide a custom user interface on a screen so they can be easily programmed and controlled to achieve the customer’s environmental objectives and give the cultivator the ability to access this data and react to alerts remotely.
 
We entered this aspect of our business to satisfy customer needs that we did not previously address and that historically were provided by third-party controls contractors. Our entry into the SCA market helps both our customers and our business. Our customers benefit because they are saved the extra work of finding and engaging an experienced CEA controls contractor. This allows them to get their facility up and running more quickly by taking one decision off the table and thereby establishing a single point of responsibility for controls implementation. We are also in a position to provide SCA because we know our proprietary equipment better than anyone, thereby ensuring smooth integration with our equipment with minimal work scope shortcomings, what we refer to as “scope gap.”
 
From a tactical perspective, and with limited incremental selling costs, our current sales team can now offer our SCA package to nearly every prospect since every cultivation facility requires SCA technology. We believe this technology value-added solution gives us an opportunity to achieve incremental project revenue at higher margins than we earn from our other equipment. Strategically, through our SCA package, we are also able to deepen our long-term customer relationship by tethering us to the customer through a controls interface (dashboard) to their facility. Future development will allow our customers to use artificial intelligence (AI) by aggregating environment and growing data to optimize energy use, operating efficiency, and product quality and yield. While there are several other total controls systems providers, we believe that our industry know-how, experience and reputation with climate control environments gives us a compelling and competitive SCA offering.
 
Product Solutions: VAR of Cultivation and Environmental Control Products
 
Some of the technologies required in CEA facilities are non-proprietary and widely available, thus making it difficult to earn strong margins on resale of products like pumps, valves, piping, etc. are commodities within the HVAC industry. However, we add value by selecting, providing and integrating these products into our customers’ projects.
 
We offer CEA-specific products as a reseller from trusted suppliers. For example, we have partnered with a third party to offer energy efficient, cost competitive LED lighting products at attractive margins. As another example, we offer benching and racking products via a partnership with a well-respected and widely used third party manufacturer.

Our Customers and Prospects
 
We provide our services and products to customers who are building, upgrading, or expanding an indoor cultivation facility for any crop. Our customers can be defined on a range of criteria.
 
New construction or the retrofit of an existing facility. Nearly all of our business has historically been for new construction facilities, but we have done retrofit projects and we believe that over time more of such business will become available.
 
Existing commercial retrofit projects represent a business opportunity in the CEA industry. The estimated 5,000+ existing cannabis producing CEA facilities in North America are easier to identify than new build projects. We believe, based on evidence and our market knowledge, that some of these exiting facilities are operating sub-optimally and have environmental control problems that our services and products can help remediate. We also believe that the energy consumption of these facilities can be reduced, and we have commenced developing services and products to help them realize savings. We believe that retrofit projects do not typically carry the financial uncertainties associated with new build projects such as licensing, permitting and funding.
 
Crop, either cannabis or non-cannabis. Nearly all of our projects have been for cannabis cultivation facilities as that has been the focus of our sales and marketing efforts. However, we have recently performed services for several non-cannabis facilities. As non-cannabis markets are growing at a pace previously seen in the cannabis markets, we are actively pursuing this market.
 
Size of facility. We serve facilities ranging in size from 2,000 square feet to over 100,000 square feet. Most facilities are between 20,000 and 70,000 square feet.
 
Customer type. Most of our customers are new entrants to the industry and have no other cultivation facilities. Some customers have one or more facilities which we classify as MFOs (multi-facility operators), and these are our favored prospects that we pursue aggressively or who turn to us after we have served them on a previous facility. We currently do not have projects with the largest, publicly traded firms (typically referred to as “MSOs,” or Multi-State Operators).
 
MFOs are customers who already own cultivation facilities and they are our preferred customers because they are likely already successful and cash-flowing, and they understand the challenges of building a new cultivation facility. They are thus a less risky prospect with a much higher likelihood of successfully completing a project.
 
New entrants are often times investors from outside the CEA industry who are attracted by the growth opportunities available as the CEA industry grows. We are particularly effective at winning business from these prospects because of our fifteen-year track record and well-known brand name within the industry. However, the risks of a failed project with these prospects are higher because of the challenges that must be overcome to successfully build and operate a CEA operation—which include (but are not limited to) ability to obtain funding, licensure, and an appropriate facility.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We have both marketing and sales organizations and employees. Our Marketing team consists of a Vice-President of Marketing Communications and three staff members. Our Sales team is comprised of a Vice-President of Sales and four sales representatives located across the country. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on winning business from new entrants and smaller MFOs.
Marketing Strategy
 
Our marketing activities are focused on generating new leads and positioning us as a leader in the CEA facilities indoor cultivation market. We lead with our value proposition of offering a wide range of proprietary and curated products and services, giving more options to our customers to satisfy their individual applications and goals, versus our competition, which only offers single solutions for each of their products.
 
Brand Image. We emphasize our 15-year presence serving the industry and our status as an industry pioneer that was founded by cultivators to provide service to cultivators. We have also positioned ourselves as an engineering company that is, we believe, the most experienced such firm serving the cannabis segment of the CEA industry. We are well-known in the industry because of the many projects we have performed and because of our longevity serving the same. We reinforce our message and positioning with regular blog posts on our website, interviews with our technical cannabis professionals in certain industry magazines and podcasts, talks and presentations at trade shows, and technical white papers. Some of our engineers sit on industry technical standards groups. Some of our projects are referred to us by previous customers, and we reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle of past projects leading to new projects.

Internet. Our marketing activities include a fresh, easy to navigate website that provides education through our SEO-optimized landing pages, case studies, white papers, blogs and articles, advertising in various trade publications and digital outlets, social media and email campaigns.
 
Paid Referrals. We provide referral agreements to parties in the industry who are in a position to refer business to us.
 
Trade Shows. We make regular appearances at trade shows. We are also frequent speakers or panel members at trade show educational events. Our co-founder, Brandy Keen, is a well-known industry pioneer and authority who writes regular blog posts and is a sought-after speaker at industry events.
 
Investor Relations/Public Relations. We actively manage our public image to both the industry and to investors. For the industry we regularly publish press releases with positive company news including new product releases and major project wins. We retain an Investor Relations firm to provide regular coverage of Company developments to our investors and other stakeholders.
 
Sales Strategy
 
Our sales strategy is to call on leads developed by our marketing efforts, leads referred by existing customers, networking at industry events and trade shows, and to develop relationships with potential prospects. Our sales cycle is long, ranging from several months to 18 months from first contact with a prospect to signing a contract. In the organic growth strategy update we announced in May of 2021, we specifically added architectural services to our offering. Typically, architectural services are the first that will be needed when a facility is to be built. By selling our architectural services to a prospect we gain an early foothold in the relationship with the prospect. By offering most of the services and products that the prospect will need for their facility, we attempt to keep competitors out of the relationship.
Sales, Contract, and Fulfillment Cycle
 
The sales cycles for our new build commercial projects can vary significantly depending on the size and complexity of the project. From pre-sales and technical advisory meetings to sales contract execution, to engineering and design services and equipment delivery, and all the way through installation and startup of the installed system, the full cycle can range from three months to two years. Since we do not install any of the products we sell, our customers are required to use third-party installation contractors, which adds to the variability of the sales cycle.
 
When a customer agrees to enter into a contract with us it can be for any or all of the following:
 

● | Architectural design services; 
--+---------------------------------
● | MEP engineering services; 
● | Equipment provision; and 
● | Preventative maintenance. 


13
--


To enter into a contract, we require a 5-10% deposit and a signed contract. We then require progress payments as architectural and/or engineering work is completed, and before equipment is shipped. We generally do not ship equipment to a customer unless that equipment has been fully paid. The sales and fulfillment cycle can be summarized as follows, with elapsed time from start:
 
Start: Early meetings to understand goals and resources;
 
1-2 months: Proposal development and presentation;
 
3 months: Contract acceptance (requires 5-10% deposit);
 
3 months: Architectural and MEP engineering work begin;
 
4-5 months: Architectural and MEP engineering work completed, and equipment selections finalized (services paid for before release of construction drawings);
 
5 months: equipment ordered (40% deposit on equipment received prior to ordering);
 
6-18 months: construction project commences, equipment delivered as required (fully paid for before shipping); and
 
12-18 months: all equipment shipped and installed, project completed, operator training and system startup conducted.
 
Gross Margins and Revenue.
 
Architectural and Engineering services fees can range from $10,000 to over $100,000, depending on the size of the project. Revenue from equipment sales on individual projects has been over $3,000,000 but most typically ranges from $500,000 to $1,500,000. Our target gross margin from equipment sales ranges from 25% to 60%, with services margins ranging from 10% to 20%.
Our Corporate Growth Strategy
 
We continue to build upon the significant momentum we experienced in 2019, prior to the business disruptions caused by the COVID 19 pandemic. As we navigated through these challenges in the first half of 2020, we have seen an encouraging return to the pre-COVID-19 momentum, as evidenced by our revenue growth from Q3 2020 to Q4 2021. We believe this validates our market opportunity and our business model, and we remain committed to growing revenue and margin.
 
To that end, our corporate strategy for growing the Company and increasing shareholder value are based on the following pillars:


Pursue Aggressive Organic Growth.
 
We serve a market for the construction and expansion of CEA facilities and businesses that is projected to grow at a 20%+ compound annual growth rate for the foreseeable future. Our primary vertical market of cannabis cultivation facilities has been joined by the similarly rapidly growing urban vertical farming market to create two market opportunity segments that we are positioned to serve.
 
In May of 2021 we announced a new strategy for our organic growth, which included the following elements.:
 
Identify and Pursue New markets
 
Non-cannabis CEA (vertical/urban farming). We have expanded our business development plan to pursue non-cannabis CEA facilities, at least doubling our total addressable market. We have served several non-cannabis CEA facilities in the past and present and we have expanded our marketing efforts to aggressively pursue this vertical market.
 
Expand Product & Services Offering
 
We decided to expand our product offerings from a focus on primarily environmental control offerings to one that offers all of the primary technologies and services required in a CEA facility: architectural design, lighting, benching, HVACD, sensing & control systems, CO2 enrichment and control, water filtration & condensate reclamation, irrigation & fertigation systems, wastewater treatment, air sanitation, preventative maintenance and odor mitigation. In the last four months alone, we have seen a broadening of our booked contract pipeline to include offerings of architectural design, lighting, benching, HVACD, sensing & control systems, CO2 control, water reclamation, air sanitation and preventative maintenance.

Enhance Brand Through New Corporate and Trade Name
 
In May of 2021 we adopted the trade name “Surna Cultivation Technologies” because we believe that the new name will more clearly identify our business to prospects and make us easier to find on various social media and search engines. In November of 2021, we changed our corporate name from Surna Inc. to CEA Industries Inc. In January of 2022, Surna Cultivation Technologies LLC was formed and is a wholly owned subsidiary of CEA Industries Inc. Our recent name change, and internal restructuring were affected to prepare us to acquire potential targets and to nurture internal growth initiatives.
Seek Strategic Relationships, Mergers, and Acquisitions to Add to our Existing Business.


We also intend to grow our business through mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships that serve our goal of being a leading and rapidly-growing supplier to the CEA industry. Our strategy is to use our insight to select the right partners to align with and the right acquisition targets to pursue.
 
Our experience and engineering advantages. Our core expertise, developed over many years, is engineering the environmental controls of CEA facilities, which is a sophisticated engineering challenge due to the high humidity (latent heat) and heat load (sensible heat) within these facilities. Not only are the loads high, but the environmental conditions within these facilities must be held closely within limits that these facilities’ managers request. Engineering to meet these limits requires us to consider all of the primary components within the facility: lighting, irrigation, HVACD, fertigation, sensors, controls, CO2 dosing, monitoring and alarms, facility physical limits such as power availability, and energy consumption. This expertise uniquely informs our view on the requirements of CEA facilities.
 
Technical advantages as a strategic partner and acquirer. We believe that the expertise gained in engineering many of the primary technical components within a CEA facility provides us with a uniquely well-informed view of the efficacy of the many primary components on offer in the marketplace. We further believe that this knowledge will help us make wise choices when deciding on products to pursue for strategic relationships, and providers to potentially merge with or acquire.
 
Corporate advantages as a strategic partner and acquirer. For smaller component providers we believe that our publicly traded platform and our existing sales and marketing reach will make us an attractive partner. Our public status provides sources of capital, and our sales and marketing resources can help us bring other products to market.
 
Continue to Improve Our Public Profile and the Market for Our Securities
 
We recognize that the costs of being a public company are substantial. However, we believe that a public currency offers a wider audience to support our story and partnership opportunities to build that story. With that goal in mind, we continue to build our public brand through public capital markets, and as part of that effort, we completed two capital markets transactions that we believe will benefit our current and future shareholders.
 
First, effective February 10, 2022, trading of both shares of the Company’s common stock and certain of the Company’s warrants (which previously traded on the over-the-counter (“OTCQB”) market) commenced on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Uplist”). We believe an Uplist to the Nasdaq will contribute to our stock’s liquidity and offer a more visible and attractive equity currency to current and future investors.
 
Second, effective February 15, 2022, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $22 million from the sale of 5,811,138 shares of its common stock together with 5,811,138 warrants (the “Offering”). We believe the Offering will provide immediate liquidity to help fund the Company’s growth strategy through both organic development and opportunistic acquisitions. We also believe the expansion of our investor base created by the Offering will enhance our overall audience and strengthen the market for our securities.


Our Competitive Advantages
 
Customer Operations. First and foremost, we seek to help our customers build the most effective and efficient facility possible. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to engineer all of the complex components of a CEA facility into a holistic whole because of our dedicated engineering staff and our experience with over 800 cultivators including over 200 commercial facilities. Our 15 years in the business has provided us a wide network of technology vendors from which we curate a selection of the best products. In addition, we are the leading experts in applying the most challenging component of the technical infrastructure, the environmental controls, and we have the knowledge required to engineer the interactions among the required components. A PE license is required for all MEP engineering work, and this engineering competence is one of our greatest strengths.
 
Sustainability. Indoor cultivation facilities, like data centers, are resource intensive. Several U.S. states have implemented building code changes that place limits on the energy consumption allowed within cultivation facilities, and we anticipate that more states will do the same. Among our objectives is to provide our customers with the most energy-efficient alternatives for their infrastructure. Energy and resource efficiency is a high priority to us as engineers, and our most senior engineering staff hold the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) credential. Our CEO previously helped build a cleantech company, has been involved in the cleantech industry for over five years, and published a book on selling energy efficient technologies. We believe that we are in a position to lead the industry in sustainability initiatives which our customers will highly value.

Customer Acquisition. By offering Facility Selection & Design services we seek to build relationships with prospects at the earliest opportunity in the lifecycle of the cultivation business. By expanding our offerings to include nearly every piece of the technical infrastructure required in a facility we hope to engage at the earliest possible moment with the customer and earn the opportunity to provide all the products and services required for a facility. Our post-start-up, lifecycle services help us maintain a relationship with the customer as long as the facility is in operation. Our observation is that our customers want to focus on growing plants and entrust us to maintain the technical infrastructure of complex systems; we believe that they will accept our offer to do so, as some already have.
 
Revenue and Revenue Recurrence. We believe that our revenue can be expanded by offering most of the primary technical infrastructure components for a cultivation facility. For example, if we are able to provide all of the primary infrastructure components to a cultivation facility, our revenue on a project could be up to 200% higher than if we provided the environmental controls systems alone. In the past we did not have products or services to offer our customers after a facility was constructed. We have recently begun to offer preventative maintenance services, and we believe that by expanding this service offering we will be able to gain long-term recurring revenue on a subscription basis.
 
Our Competition
 
Our environmental control systems and our related engineering and design services compete with various national and local HVACD contractors and traditional HVACD equipment suppliers who traditionally resell, design, and implement climate control systems for commercial and industrial facilities, most of whom do not have the specific knowledge that we have about the complexities and challenges of CEA facilities. We have positioned ourselves to differ from these competitors by providing a broad range of engineering and design services and environmental control systems, across most major HVACD solutions, including chilled water systems, custom air handling units, split systems, and packaged roof-top units. Each is tailored specifically for managing the distinct challenges involved in CEA facilities. We believe our industry-specific applications and experience in the CEA market allow us to deliver the right solution to our cultivation customers. Unlike many of our competitors, our solutions are designed specifically for cultivators to provide tight temperature and humidity control, reduce bio-security risks, reduce energy requirements, and minimize maintenance complexity, costs and downtime. However, we are seeing more competitors enter the CEA market, focused on emulating the same types of crop-specific climate control systems and engineering services that we offer. We believe this increased competition may adversely impact our ability to obtain new facility projects from both MFOs and independent smaller growers and could require us to accept lower gross margins on our projects.
 
As the cannabis segment of the CEA industry continues to mature and develop and legalization becomes more prevalent, we expect to see more competition from agricultural product and service providers who seek to expand into this niche of the CEA market. Going forward, we intend to expand our focus to include non-cannabis crops grown in controlled environments such as leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, mustard, cress), microgreens (leafy greens harvested at the first true leaf stage), ethnic vegetables, ornamentals and small fruits (such as strawberries, blackberries and raspberries), bell peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Companies already operating in the non-cannabis CEA industry may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger client bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. These competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential clients, employees, strategic partners, distribution channels and advertisers. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and a potential loss of market share.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark rights, licenses, trade secrets, and laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with our employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have several issued patents, we do not believe that these issued patents currently provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. We have registered trademarks around our core Surna brand in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions, as well as the Surna logo and the combined Surna logo and name in the United States. Our Surna trademark is also registered in the European Union and Canada. We also recently secured trademark registration for our proprietary SCA platform, SentryIQ, in the United States and Canada. Subject to ongoing use and renewal, trademark protection is potentially perpetual. We actively protect our inventions, new technologies, and product developments by maintaining trade secrets and, in limited circumstances, filing for patent protection.

Employees
 
We currently have 31 active full-time employees. However, we may engage, and have in the past utilized, the services of consultants, independent contractors, and other non-employee professionals. Additional employees may be hired in the future depending on need, available resources, and our achieved growth.
US Government Regulation
 
While we do not generate any revenue from the direct sale of cannabis products, we have historically, and continue to, offer our services and engineering solutions to indoor cultivators that are engaged in various aspects of the cannabis industry. Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which specific uses of marijuana have been legalized, such as medical marijuana or for adult recreational purpose, its use remains a violation of federal laws.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, manufacture, distribute or sell cannabis or cannabis products, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
Previously, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration revised this policy but made no major changes in enforcement through Attorney General Jeffrey Sessions rescinding the Cole Memorandum. The Department of Justice will continue to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis under established principles in setting their law enforcement priorities to prevent:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis products, such as marijuana, to minors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of cannabis; 
● | the diversion of cannabis products from states where it is legal under state law to states where it is not legal under state law; 
● | the use of state-authorized cannabis activity as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis products; 
● | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis product usage; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most federally chartered banks will not accept deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry generally bank with state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to the industry.
 
In 2014, Congress passed a spending bill containing a provision (the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, now referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) blocking federal funds and resources allocated under the 2015 appropriations bill from being used to “prevent such States from implementing their own State medical marijuana laws.” The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, however, did not codify any federal protections for medical marijuana patients and producers operating within state law. The Justice Department maintains that it can still prosecute violations of the federal cannabis laws and continue cases already in the courts. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment must be re-enacted every year, and it was continued for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and currently, now known as the Joyce Amendment, remains in effect through December 3, 2021. The continued re-authorization of the Joyce Amendment cannot be assured. If the Joyce Amendment is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana use and cannabis related laws would increase. However, state laws do not supersede the prohibitions set forth in the federal drug laws.

In order to participate in either the medical or the adult use aspects of the cannabis industry, all businesses and employees must obtain licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions as well. As an example, Colorado issues four types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.
 
Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of cannabis businesses that are involved with the plant and its products. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements, and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
