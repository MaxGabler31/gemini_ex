ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Corporate History and Business Development
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 8, 2007, under the name “Aspen Global Corp.” On June 10, 2008, we changed our name to “Diversified Mortgage Workout Corp.”
 
On June 30, 2012, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement with Sanyi Group, we acquired 100%of the equity interest in Sanyi Group from its sole owner, Mr. Xin Jin, our current sole director, CEO and CFO, in consideration of 10,000,000 “post-split” (as defined below) shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock comprised of “restricted securities” as defined in Rule 144 of the SEC, which were issued to Mr. Jin on August 30, 2013. On the closing of this acquisition, we succeeded to the business operations of Sanyi Group, then consisting of the operation of two (2) wellness centres discussed below.
 
On June 19, 2013, Arem Pacific Arizona acquired voting control of the Company (then “Diversified Workout Corporation”). Subsequently, on August 8, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Arem Pacific Arizona from its then existing shareholders; and we retired and returned to our treasury all of the capital stock acquired in the Arem Pacific Arizona transaction, resulting in it becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
We changed our name in Delaware to “Arem Pacific Corporation” on July 23, 2013; and we effected a 388 to one (1) reverse stock split of our common stock on or about that date. Effective April 15, 2016, our Form S-1 Registration Statement registering shares of our common stock for public sale by certain “selling shareholders” of the Company was declared effective by the SEC. We became delinquent in our reports required to be filed under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act on or about February 15, 2017, and this Annual Report is our first filing with the SEC since that date.
 
Our current corporate structure is depicted below:
 
Arem Pacific Corporation (a Delaware corporation)
100% owned 
Arem Pacific Corporation (an Arizona corporation)
100% owned 
Sanyi Group Pty. Ltd. an Australian corporation 

 
For additional information about our corporate structure, please see the caption “References” and the heading “Corporate History and Business Development” above. All of our current principal operations are conducted through Sanyi Group in Victoria, Australia.
 
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017
 
During fiscal 2017, we closed one (1) of our two (2) wellness centers, which was located in the Chirnside Park Shopping Centre in a suburb of Victoria. This wellness centre was closed because our premier leasing contract for that wellness centre was becoming due and the owner of those premises had proposed a rental increase of approximately 50%. Since then, we have operated only one (1) wellness centre, which is also located in the Point Cook Shopping Centre in Victoria, Australia.
 
We rebranded ourselves to provide a unique service and marketing plan focusing on an in-service orientation strategy to ensure complete customer satisfaction when using our massage and related wellness services. Our objectives are to (i) maintain a happy customer database, depending on regular shopping mall promotions where our current facilities are located to attract walk-in customers; (ii) offer referral program cards to our customers to encourage additional services; and (iii) retain current customers and access new customers in return.
 
We have merged our experience, expertise and considerate care in our genuine wellness services to offer the customer unforgettable relaxation experiences in massage therapy, providing a quiet and personal therapeutic ambient environment.

A full-time employee is maintained throughout the year to lower our overhead expenses, with a team of part-time masseurs available to cater to any surge in customers whenever the demand rises. Our marketing expense is very minimal since our wellness centre is conveniently located within a major shopping centre, providing easy access to local residents and nearby office staffs and visiting tourists.
 
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018
 
The rebranding and re-strategizing of our marketing plan in fiscal 2017 were enhanced further with a year-round special promotion discount to improve sales revenue in attracting more potential walk-in and regular customers. The plan was to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty and service-oriented marketing, with a competitive pricing, offering special promotions year round in our competitive environment.
 
Full-time employees were maintained during fiscal 2018, along with a well-trained part-time masseur who was not on our payroll, to cater to sudden upsurges in demand for our wellness services. Part-time masseurs are paid when they are called upon to carry out the customer requested massage sessions or wellness packages we offer. With this “customer focus” approach, our attitude ensures every customer is truly satisfied with our proven and accepted wellness services. Our marketing promotional costs continued to be minimal.
 
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019
 
We further enhanced on our established 2017 and 2018 marketing plans by promoting an accumulative discount card and introduced a 100% satisfied or 100% refund service. This unique promotional method was implemented to attract more customers to increase our revenue and reduce our marketing related costs.
 
We realised natural therapy providers in Australia were undergoing a period of fierce competition, and we positioned our marketing strategy by constantly reviewing and processing improvements to all of our existing promotional activities in an attempt to stay ahead of our competitors. In this respect, we have focused on the following:
 
-        Convenience – Easy access to our wellness centre; 
 -        Comfort – Well equipped facilities designed to create a relaxing, cordial, friendly and comfortable environment; 
 -        Quality Service – All masseurs have formal training and extensive experience; and
 -        Flexibility – Onsite therapeutic massage services adjustable to customers’ schedules and needs.
 
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020
 
To further expand our wellness services business internationally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we planned expanding our traditional Chinese massage therapy and related services into China, and we spent almost three (3) months interviewing and engaging experienced massage therapists in China to join us as part of this strategy.
 
We focused on expanding our wellness services to China, which we believed to be the most promising massage therapy market. We identified future referral partners from major cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Sichuan, Beijing and Shanghai, where we anticipated opening additional wellness centres; and we issued shares of our common stock comprised of restricted securities to these potential partners as incentives. The partners were to be compensated for their respective referrals pursuant to the terms of a “Company Representative Agreement,” which each was required to execute and deliver to us as a condition of receiving these shares of our common stock, and which provides for a sliding scale of a percentage of the price of the wellness services rendered to the referred party at our anticipated planned facilities based upon the experience and qualifications of our therapist who rendered the referred services See Part IV, Item 15, Exhibit 99.1, for a Form of this Company Representative Agreement.
 
We determined that a number of queries and concerns were required to be considered prior to any plans for any wellness service centers to be opened in China, in addition to its strict border restrictions and other Covid-19 related controls, including, but not limited to (i) local law requirements in the cities we had selected; (ii) location, pricing, accessibility and potential customer traffic for any planned wellness centre; (iii) contract terms and conditions of any potential location, including the size of any such location, renewal rights, rental fees, termination notices and related matters; (iv) requirements for the operations of the wellness centres, including the availability of qualified personnel and their number, compensation arrangements, required equipment and supplies, among other similar issues; and (v) the total estimated cost of opening any such wellness centre and the potential methods of funding its operations.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2021
 
The Covid-19 outbreak in China in mid-fiscal year 2020 led to significant impacts on businesses and industries and has caused us to delay and pause our planned expansion of our wellness services to China, though we maintained our contacts in China through early fiscal 2022 to monitor, plan and prepare for expanding our wellness services to China, all depending on how China is reacting to and mitigating the impact of Covid-19.
 
From an economic perspective, recovery from a global pandemic like Covid-19 will take a long time. The future is going to focus on self-responsibility as people may realize the importance of taking care of their own health. We believe our customers will not only desire our massage and other wellness services; they will want to learn about the process and health benefits of our wellness services. Accordingly, our business model may have to change and may result in our offering of an “at home initiative” that will offer proactive and pragmatic ways for people to care for themselves and the people they love. This change of our business model may require more training, hiring better qualified employees and assessing customer reactions to our current and planned wellness services, all of which may impact our operating expenses and results of operations.
 
Covid-19 has had a minor impact on our business in Australia due to the tight control of local governmental agencies in respect of testing, monitoring and treating Covid-19; and we have experienced periodic lockdowns of our Victoria wellness centre. During fiscal 2021, we have continued with the same marketing plan we had in fiscal 2020 (except the plans for expansion to China, which were put on hold), and our wellness centre continues to focus on providing excellent wellness services. Five (5) full-time resource personnel are still maintained from our fiscal 2019 employees, with a back-up pool of well-trained and part-time masseurs to cover demand and who are paid when the particular wellness service is rendered. Continuing promotions and the heavy traffic flow in the shopping centre where our wellness centre is located continues to keep our marketing expenses in check.
 
With the Covid-19 pandemic continuing, all activities on our initial marketing plans in China have stopped completely, though we are optimistic that we can revive our contacts and enter the Chinese market since our basic groundwork has already been established with selected potential locations and supporting resources. We are waiting for the right entry moment to reactivate all our marketing plan and established structure to capture China’s potential for wellness services and “spa” related market opportunities, subject to available funding and resources.
 
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022
 
The fiscal year 2022 also fell within the Australian Government Authority’s MCO regarding the Covid-19 pandemic (from Feb 27, 2020, until July 6, 2022), with constant lockdowns, restricted people movement and border restrictions. On July 6, 2022, border restrictions for people travelling to and from Australia were lifted; however, this fiscal year saw improved revenue compared to fiscal 2021 as the Australian Government Authority started allowing occasional people movement and declared less frequent lockdowns, allowing our wellness centre to be open for business for a greater period of time. To minimize marketing costs and expenditures during this Covid-19 pandemic period, management decided to continue maintaining the same marketing strategy plan carried on in fiscal 2021, including the same headcount of personnel to support our wellness centre’s operations.
Business
 
Overview
 
Through Sanyi Group, we are engaged in providing wellness services that include acupressure/reflexology, massage therapy and cupping. We offer various types of massage therapy, such as Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone oil, among others, all as discussed below. 
 
Principal Products or Services and their Markets
 
Since 2017, we have operated one (1) wellness centre in Victoria State, Australia. The wellness centre is located Point Cook Shopping Center, Shop 109, Stockland Point Cook, Corner Murong and 20 Main Street, Point Cook, Victoria, 3030.

-

The Point Cook wellness centre consists of approximately seventy-seven (77) square meters, and its layout is depicted below:
 
The Point Cook location has one (1) full-time supervisor and four (4) part-time masseurs. The size of any future planned locations, if any, are anticipated to range between fifty (50) to one hundred (100) square meters.
 
Services Provided at our Wellness Centre.
 
We provide the following services at our wellness centre:
 
· Acupressure/Reflexology;
 · Neck, shoulder, back, legs and full body massages;
 · Foot massages;
 · Cupping; and
 · Deep tissue and hot oil massages.
 
Acupressure/Reflexology – is considered acupuncture without needles. Similar to acupuncture, strategic body meridians are targeted by the practitioner using pressure from their fingers, elbows or special devices. Acupressure also is a component of traditional Chinese medicine. Reflexology is similar to acupressure and targets specific points on the feet and hands, which correspond to organs in the body.
Massage Therapy – involves the application of soft tissue manipulation techniques to the body designed to reduce muscle tension and increase circulation. There are many variations of massage therapy, including Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone oil, among others. It is believed that massage therapy was practiced in many ancient civilizations, including China, India and Greece.
Cupping – involves the warming of glass cups through a flammable substance, which eliminates oxygen, thus creating a vacuum. The cup is then placed over a specific area. The lack of oxygen anchors the cup, and the suction draws the skin, which simulates blood flow to the area. This process is considered the inverse of massage. Cupping is one of the oldest forms of Chinese medicine. 
 
These wellness services are provided by skilled practitioners trained in massage therapy, acupressure and cupping. Sessions vary from fifteen (15) to ninety (90) minutes and prices vary according to the nature of the services and length of services session.
 
Our Revenue Model.
 We generate revenues from the following methods:
 
Fees for services are charged to our customers dependent upon the treatment administered and length of time of the treatment. Computed on an hourly basis, these fees generally range from $60 to $85 per hour.
 
Revenue derived from an average customer is approximately $60 per visit. At our locations, each masseur averages five (5) customers/day (eight [8] hours of operation) or thirty (30) customers/week (six [6] working days) or 1,500 customers/year (fifty [50] weeks). An average of five (5) masseurs yields approximate sales revenue of $200,000-250,000 annualized. Although our average has been five (5) customers a day per each masseur, we believe that each masseur is capable of serving up to ten (10) customers per day.

Our Masseurs.
 Our wellness centre location is staffed with between five (5) to six (6) masseurs and one (1) supervisor. The supervisor is our most experienced masseur at the wellness centre. The supervisor oversees the day-to-day operations of the wellness centre and may serve customers during personnel shortages. Our masseurs are employees and are paid a yearly salary of approximately $53,900, depending on experience. In addition, we are required by applicable law to pay our full and part-time employees “Public Liability Insurance,” which is approximately $446 yearly for each employee, including “Professional Indemnity Insurance” at a cost of (0.6%) of the employee’s salary. From time to time, we use independent contractors during personnel shortages, and they are paid a portion of the customer fee ranging between 45-55% of the fee.
Marketing.
 The marketing promotional activities for our current market and year are similar to previous years, including year-round special promotional discounts to improve sales revenue in attracting more potential walk-in and regular customers and to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty and service-oriented marketing, with a competitive pricing, offering various special promotions year-round in our competitive environment.
Our Growth Strategy.
 Other than the potential of expanding to the overseas market in China, if and when possible, we have no current plans to open additional wellness centres. Also, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”) in Australia increased by approximately 6.1% during the twelve (12) month period ended June 30, 2022, with the most significant increases being in the cost of new dwellings (5.6%), automobile fuel (4.2%) and furniture (7%). The rise in the CPI can have an adverse effect on personal disposable income available for the types of services we provide and could certainly limit any expansion plans we may consider.
 
Global massage services project that the market for wellness services like those we provide are on the rise, and medical spas have and are expected to register increased growth in the coming years. We believe that the Chinese market is the most promising area driven by a hectic lifestyle in urban areas. Rising demand from emerging markets is expected to propel the demand for spa treatments in the future with increased focus on personal health.
 
As outlined above, we have identified future partners from strategic cities in China to help us exploit the Chinese market in the major cities of China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai for fiscal 2023, who would be compensated under the above referenced Company Representative Agreement that is Exhibit 99.1 of this Annual Report, in Part IV, Item 15, if and when we are able to expand our wellness services to China, as to which no assurance can be given. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the consumer price index (“CPI”) in China rose approximately 2.5% during the twelve (12) month period ended June 30, 2022. The urban growth rate was approximately 2.5%, and the rural growth rate was approximately 2.6%. These overall increases were much lower than those experienced in Australia.
 
Seasonality.
 There is no discernible seasonality in our business, although we expect that the first calendar year quarter is typically our lowest as a percentage of total annual gross revenue.  Revenue and operating income will vary by quarter and are hard to predict from quarter to quarter.   In addition, the volatility in the local economy will impact our quarterly revenue and operating income, along with any effects related to the status of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Our equipment needs are minimal, consisting of massage benches and various office equipment and computers. We purchase our equipment from local suppliers on an “as needed” basis and presently do not believe the loss of any one supplier will have an adverse effect on our business, so long as our needs are not adversely affected by the current issues being experienced in world-wide supply chain. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
Currently, we have not entered into any written employment agreement with any of our directors or officers, and we do any not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.   Management does not plan to hire any additional employees at this time.

-

Competition
 
We plan to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business operations. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence and the competitors’ introduction of low-priced wellness services, as well as personal independent contractors who provide massage and related wellness services.
 
Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
There are no licensing requirements for masseurs in Australia. Many of our masseurs have received a “Certificate IV in Massage Therapy Practice” from Melbourne College of Professional Therapists. Potential recruitment of masseurs without these qualifications will require additional training and close supervision by our senior supervisor. The remainder of our masseurs have been trained internally by our senior supervisor.  Trainees undergo a three (3) months training program with our supervisor. In addition, we require each masseur to have a first-aid certificate, a certificate of insurance and two (2) written character references from the staff of a college or from a member of the Australian Association of Massage Therapists.
 
Existing and Probable Government Regulation to Our Current and Intended Business
 
We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we do and where we plan to conduct our wellness services operations and sell advertising, which are generally applicable to most businesses, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to any special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.”  That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC.
Emerging Growth Company
 
In fiscal 2019 our “emerging growth company” designation as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act,” expired as of the fifth anniversary of our initial registered public offering. During our “emerging growth company” designation we did not utilize any financial statement waivers as a result of that designation.
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence.  It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by publicly-held companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation to management’s conclusions about internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund black-out periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act could substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our shareholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent do not require us to provide our shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14 because we file our reports with the SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, resulting from the large number of shareholders we have. However, if we register our securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, we will become subject to Section 14(a).

6
-


We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, primarily because we have in excess of 500 shareholders of record, and we are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and changes in resignations of engagements of auditors and bankruptcy, among other events) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full-Time Employees
 
As of June 30, 2022, we had one (1) full-time employee and four (4) part-time employees, including our sole director. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
 
Subsidiaries
 
For information about our subsidiaries and their formation dates, see the caption “References” at the forepart of this Annual Report and the heading “Corporate History and Business Development” of Part I, Item 1, above, and Exhibit 21 in Part IV, Item 15 hereof.
 
Additional Information
 
You may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.  You may also find all the reports or registration statements that we have previously filed or file in the future in the “Edgar Archives” of the SEC at its Internet site at www.sec.gov.
