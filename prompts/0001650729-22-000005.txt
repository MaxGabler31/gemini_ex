Item 1. Business
    The following discussion of our business contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information” above. Our business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A., ‘‘Risk Factors’’ below. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Company Overview
    We are the largest and only national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies in the United States and have a growing presence in Canada. Our customers are primarily residential and commercial landscape professionals who specialize in the design, installation, and maintenance of lawns, gardens, golf courses, and other outdoor spaces. As of January 2, 2022, we had over 590 branch locations in 45 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Through our expansive North American network, we offer a comprehensive selection of more than 135,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) including irrigation supplies, fertilizer and control products (e.g., herbicides), hardscapes (including pavers, natural stone, and blocks), landscape accessories, nursery goods, outdoor lighting, and ice melt products to green industry professionals. We also provide value-added consultative services to complement our product offerings and to help our customers operate and grow their businesses. Our consultative services include assistance with irrigation network design, commercial project planning, generation of sales leads, business operations, and product support services, as well as a series of technical and business management seminars that we call SiteOne University. 
    Our typical customer is a private landscape contractor that operates in a single market. We interact regularly with our customers because of the recurring nature of landscape services and because most contractors buy products on an as-needed basis. We believe our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty, and drives repeat business. In addition, our broad product portfolio, convenient branch locations, and nationwide fleet of over 1,900 delivery vehicles position us well to meet the needs of our customers and ensure timely delivery of products. We source our products from approximately 5,000 suppliers, including the major irrigation equipment manufacturers, turf and ornamental fertilizer/chemical companies, and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes, and other landscape products. 
    We have a balanced mix of sales across product categories, construction sectors, and end markets. We derived approximately 60% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales from the residential construction sector, 30% from the commercial (including institutional) construction sector, and 10% from the recreational and other construction sector. By end market, we derived approximately 37% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales from maintenance of residential, commercial, and recreational properties. The recurring nature of landscape maintenance demand helps to provide stability in our financial performance across economic cycles. Fertilizer and control products are the primary products used in maintenance. The sale of products relating to new construction of homes, commercial buildings, and recreational spaces accounted for approximately 36% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales. These products primarily include irrigation, hardscapes, landscape accessories, nursery, and outdoor lighting. Approximately 27% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales were derived from sales of products for the repair and upgrade of existing landscapes. These sales benefit from increasing existing home sales, increasing home prices, and rising consumer spending.
Net Sales for 2021 Fiscal Year
Our History
    Our company was established after Deere & Company (“Deere”) entered the wholesale landscape distribution market through the acquisitions of McGinnis Farms and Century Rain Aid in 2001, United Green Mark in 2005, and LESCO Inc. (“LESCO”) in 2007, each of which significantly expanded our geographic footprint and broadened our product portfolio. In December 2013, an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) purchased a 60% interest in our company from Deere (“CD&R Acquisition”). On May 17, 2016, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock.
Our Industry
    Based on management’s estimates, we believe that our addressable market in North America for the wholesale distribution of landscape supplies represented approximately $23 billion in revenue in 2021. Growth in our industry is driven by a broad array of factors, including consumer spending, housing starts, existing home sales, home prices, commercial construction, repair and remodeling spending, and demographic trends. Within the wholesale landscape supply industry, products sold for residential applications represent the largest construction sector, followed by the commercial, and recreational and other sectors. Based on management estimates, we believe that nursery products represent the largest product category in the industry, with sales accounting for more than one-third of industry sales, followed by landscape accessories with approximately one-fifth of industry sales, and each of control products, hardscapes, irrigation products and outdoor lighting, and fertilizer and other accounting for approximately one-tenth of industry sales.
    The wholesale landscape supply industry is highly fragmented, consisting primarily of regional private businesses that typically have a small geographic footprint, a limited product offering, and limited supplier relationships. Wholesale landscape supply distributors primarily sell to landscape service firms, ranging from sole proprietorships to national enterprises. Landscape service firms include general landscape contractors and specialty landscape firms, who provide services such as lawn care and tree and foliage maintenance. Over the past decade, professional landscape contractors have increasingly offered additional products and services to meet their customers’ needs. These firms historically needed to make numerous trips to branches in various locations to source their products. Consequently, landscape professionals have come to value distribution partners who offer a larger variety of product categories and services, particularly given the recurring nature of landscape maintenance services.
Our Strategies
    Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Build Upon Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships to Expand Organically
    Our national footprint and broad supplier relationships, combined with our regular interaction with a large and diverse customer base, make us an important link in the supply chain for landscape products. Our suppliers benefit from access to our more than 280,000 customers, a single point of contact for improved production planning and efficiency, and our ability to bring new product launches quickly to market on a national scale. We intend to continue to increase our size and scale in customer, geographic, and product reach, which we believe will continue to benefit our supplier base. We will continue to work with new and existing suppliers to maintain the most comprehensive product offering for our customers at competitive prices and enhance our role as a critical player in the supply chain. 
Grow at the Local Level
    The vast majority of our customers operate at a local level. We believe we can grow market share in our existing markets with limited capital investment by systematically executing local strategies to expand our customer base, increase the amount of our customers’ total spending with us, optimize our network of locations, coordinate multi-site deliveries, partner with strategic local suppliers, introduce new products and services, increase our share of underrepresented products in particular markets, and improve sales force performance. We currently offer our full product line in only approximately 30% of the metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) in the U.S. where we have a branch, and therefore believe we have the capacity to offer significantly more product lines and services in our geographic markets.
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions
    Through acquisitions, we have added new markets in the U.S. and Canada, new product lines, talented associates, and operational best practices. In addition, we increased our sales by introducing products from our existing portfolio to customers of newly acquired companies. We intend to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions to better serve our customers, grow our market share, and enhance our local market leadership positions by taking advantage of our scale, operational experience, and acquisition know-how. In addition, we currently have branches in approximately 50% of the 384 U.S. MSAs and are focused on identifying and reviewing attractive new geographic markets for expansion through acquisitions. We will continue to apply a selective and disciplined acquisition strategy to maximize synergies obtained from enhanced sales and lower procurement and administrative costs.
Execute on Identified Operational Initiatives 
    We continue to undertake operational initiatives, utilizing our scale to improve our profitability, enhance supply chain efficiency, strengthen our category management capabilities, streamline and refine our marketing process, and invest in more sophisticated information technology systems and data analytics. Additionally, we have continued our digital initiative, to include the enhancement of our website and business-to-business (“B2B”) e-Commerce platform. Although we are still primarily in the early stages of these initiatives, they have already enhanced our customer service, contributed to improvement in our profitability, and we believe we will continue to benefit from these and other operational improvements.
Be the Employer of Choice
    We believe our associates are the key drivers of our success, and we aim to recruit, train, promote, and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our size and scale enable us to offer structured training and career path opportunities for our associates. We have built a vibrant and entrepreneurial culture that rewards performance at the area and branch levels. We promote ongoing, open and honest communication with our associates, including periodic engagement surveys, to ensure mutual trust, engagement, and performance improvement. We believe that high-performing local leaders coupled with creative, adaptable, and engaged associates are critical to our success and to maintaining our competitive position, and we are committed to being the employer of choice in our industry.
Our Products and Services
    Our comprehensive portfolio of landscape products consists of over 135,000 SKUs from approximately 5,000 suppliers. Our product portfolio includes irrigation supplies, fertilizer and control products, hardscapes, landscape accessories, nursery goods, and outdoor lighting products. Our customers value our product breadth and geographic reach, as well as our on-site expertise and consultative services. While pricing is important to our customers, availability, convenience, and expertise are also important factors in their purchase decisions. In addition to other capabilities, our ability to offer the significant yard space and special equipment required by items such as hardscapes and nursery goods provides us with a competitive advantage over many competitors who offer a more limited selection of product categories.
    Refer to “Note 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to our audited financial statements for information on our Net sales in landscaping products (irrigation supplies, hardscapes, landscape accessories, nursery goods, and outdoor lighting) and agronomic and other products (fertilizer, control products, ice melt, equipment, and other products).
Irrigation Supplies
    Our irrigation products include controllers, valves, sprinkler heads, and irrigation pipe. The market for irrigation products has historically provided stable growth and is driven primarily by new home construction and maintenance of existing irrigation systems.
Fertilizer and Other
    Our fertilizer and other products include fertilizer, grass seed, and ice melt products. Fertilizer products are sold to the maintenance end market and accordingly are relatively stable through economic cycles.
Control Products
    Our control products are specialty products that include herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, and other pesticides. Similar to fertilizer products, control products sales are strongly tied to the maintenance end market and accordingly are relatively stable through economic cycles.
Hardscapes
    Our Hardscapes include pavers, natural stone, blocks, and other durable materials.
Landscape Accessories
    Our landscape accessories products include mulches, soil amendments, drainage pipe, tools, and sod. Landscape accessories are typically sold in combination with other landscape supply products. As a result, sales of these accessories are often tied to sales of fertilizers and control products, as well as sales of nursery goods and hardscapes products.
Nursery Goods
    Our nursery goods include deciduous and evergreen shrubs, ornamental, shade, and evergreen trees, both field-grown and container-grown nursery stock, roses, perennials, annuals, bulbs, and thousands of plant species and cultivars that are available in a number of container sizes, heights, forms and bloom colors.
Outdoor Lighting
    Our outdoor lighting products include lighting fixtures (path, area, accent, up, down, well, hardscape, deck, underwater, bistro, and holiday), LED lamps, wire, transformers, and accessories.
Proprietary Branded Products
    In addition to distributing branded products of third parties, we offer products under our proprietary brands. Sales of LESCO®, SiteOne Green Tech®, and Pro-Trade® together accounted for approximately 15% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales, the large majority of which is attributable to LESCO®.
LESCO®
    LESCO® is a premium brand and maintains strong brand awareness with golf and professional landscape contractors.
    Under the LESCO® brand, we offer formulations of fertilizer (liquid and granular), combination products (pesticides on a fertilizer carrier), control products (liquid and granular pesticides), specialty chemicals, turf seed, application equipment (engine powered and walk behind or other non-engine powered), paint, maintenance products like engine oil, windshield washer fluid, ice melt, trimmer line, and soil tests. LESCO® products are sold through our branches and retail outlets such as The Home Depot, Lowe’s, and True Value.
SiteOne Green Tech®
    We offer pre-packaged landscape and irrigation management solutions that are designed to help customers manage and conserve water under the SiteOne Green Tech® brand. The core SiteOne Green Tech® product lines include central irrigation control systems, solar assemblies, fertilizer injection systems, irrigation pumps, and hand-held remote control equipment.
Pro-Trade®
    In September 2017, we launched a line of professional-grade landscape lighting fixtures, LED lamps, and transformers under our Pro-Trade® brand. The Pro-Trade® line of products is sold exclusively through our branches and website, and has expanded to include landscape lighting products, irrigation products, long handle tools, wire connectors, landscape staples, glues and solvents, and a centrifugal pump. During 2021, we introduced 20 new products and plan to continue expanding our Pro-Trade® offering in 2022.
Services
    We offer a variety of complementary, value-added services to support the sale of our products. We do not derive separate revenue for these services, but we believe they are an important differentiator in establishing our value proposition to our customers.
Product Knowledge and Technical Expertise
    Consultative services provided by our local staff, many of whom are former landscape contractors or golf course superintendents, include product selection and support, assistance with design and implementation of landscape projects, and potential sales leads for new business opportunities. Our SiteOne University program provides customers with access to substantive training and informational seminars that directly support the growth of their businesses. The program includes technical training, licensing, certifications, and business management seminars. In addition, our product category experts provide technical knowledge on the features and benefits of our products as well as installation techniques.
Project Services
    We partner with our customers by providing consultative services to help them save time, money, and effort in bidding for new projects and for new landscape installations. Our regionally based project services teams specialize in quoting, estimating, and completing sales for customers who compete in the commercial construction sector. Other services provided by our project services teams include specifications assistance and irrigation take-offs.
Partners Program
    We offer a loyalty rewards program, our Partners Program, which had approximately 22,500 enrolled customers as of January 2, 2022 and provides business and personal rewards, access to business services at preferred rates, and technical training and support. Reward points may be utilized, for example, on credit on-account, trips and special events, gift cards to major retailers, and SiteOne University courses and educational events. Access to preferred rate business services includes, for example, payroll and select human resource services, cell phone services, office supplies, and fuel rebates. For the 2021 Fiscal Year, Partners Program participants accounted for approximately 50% of our Net sales.
Operational Structure
    Our operational philosophy is to create local area teams and branch networks specifically designed to best meet our customers’ needs at the local market level, while supporting these teams with the resources of a large company delivered through regional and divisional management, including company-wide functions.
    At the local market level, we organize our over 590 branches and approximately 530 outside sales representatives into 42 designated “areas” that each typically serve a defined geography, a large MSA, or a combination of MSAs in close proximity. Area Managers are responsible for organization and talent planning, branch operations, sales strategy, and product delivery strategy. Area Managers are supported by Area Business Managers and Area Sales Managers who are responsible for executing the local market and operating strategies as well as key initiatives to grow sales and profitability.
    We support our over 590 branches and 42 areas with regional management and company-wide functions by providing: management of business performance, development and execution of local strategies, sharing of best practices, execution and integration of acquisitions, finance and accounting expertise (e.g., credit/collections, payables), category management and procurement, supply chain (e.g., planners, buyers), pricing strategies, marketing, and information technology. Our branches are integrated on a single technology platform, allowing us to leverage our full operational scale for procurement, inventory management, financial support, data analytics, and performance reporting.
    Our outside sales force is organized by geographic area. Each area maintains a number of outside sales representatives who drive sales growth on behalf of several branches across a variety of accounts from landscape contractors to municipal agencies. We also maintain a sales force of agronomic sales representatives who are focused on growing sales with customers in the golf industry. Our agronomic sellers also focus on contractors in the lawn care operations, maintenance and development, and sports turf verticals.

    We have a national account sales organization that leads sales strategy and execution for our largest national and regional customers. The national sales team is organized around 10 different market verticals: facility management, golf, sports turf, international, lawn care operators, maintenance and development, pest control, retail, sod, and tree accounts. Each national account manager is responsible for a group of large accounts and coordinates our business with them both nationally and locally through our local sales representatives. National account managers negotiate national programs with our largest customers in order to increase our share of their business.
Distribution Network
    We use two distribution models to offer a comprehensive selection of products and meet the needs of each local market.
Branches
    Our branch network is the core of our operations and creates a valuable connection between our suppliers and our customers. Of our approximately 5,000 suppliers, few are set up to serve the shipping needs of our customers as their supply chains are typically focused on bulk quantities shipped from only a few locations. In contrast, many of our customers often require comparatively small quantities of products from numerous suppliers to complete a typical project, making it difficult to source directly from those suppliers. Our branch network provides significant value to our suppliers by maintaining local availability of core and complementary products in quantities our customers need.
    The majority of our branches carry multiple product categories, but do not carry all. Branches that carry our full product lines combine our regular branch facilities with large 8-to-15 acre yards suitable for nursery goods and hardscape products. Yards are well-equipped to manage truckload-purchased landscape, nursery, and hardscape products and can maintain a diverse variety of greenhouse and nursery plants. All locations offering nursery goods have water distribution systems to maintain inventories, and many of these locations have access to municipal water supplies, wells, or ponds. Branches are strategically located near residential areas with convenient highway access. In-store merchandising displays are utilized to emphasize product features and seasonal promotions. We primarily lease 5,000 to 15,000 square foot facilities in both freestanding and multi-tenant buildings with secured outside storage yards averaging from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet.
Direct Distribution
    Our direct distribution business provides point-to-point logistics for bulk quantities of landscape products between suppliers and customers. Our direct distribution business provides customers with sourcing and logistics support services for inventory management and delivery, and in many cases, these services are more economical than the producers might otherwise provide. We believe that producers view us not as competitors, but as providers of a valuable service, brokering these large orders through the use of our network. We typically do not maintain inventory for direct distribution, but rather use our existing supplier relationships, marketing expertise, and ordering and logistics infrastructure to serve this demand, requiring less working capital investment for these sales. Approximately 6% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales were from direct distribution.
    Direct distribution is preferred for contractors with large projects, typically designed by professional landscape architects. Contractors work hand-in-hand with our outside sales and inside sales teams, including project planning support with material take-offs, product sourcing, and bid preparation. Using our large supplier network, our associates arrange convenient direct shipments to jobs, coordinated and staged according to each phase of construction. This distribution channel primarily handles bulk nursery, agronomic, landscape, and hardscape products.
Customers
    Our customers are primarily residential and commercial landscape professionals who specialize in the design, installation, and maintenance of lawns, gardens, golf courses, and other outdoor spaces. Our customer base consists of more than 280,000 firms and individuals, with our top 10 customers collectively accounting for approximately 4% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of Net sales. Small customers, with annual purchases of up to $25,000, made up 24% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales. Medium customers, with annual purchases from $25,000 up to $150,000, made up 33% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales. Large customers, with annual purchases over $150,000, made up 43% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales. Some of our largest customers include BrightView, Weed Man, Lowe’s, The Home Depot, Lawn Doctor, and Davey Tree. Distribution of our LESCO® proprietary branded products on a wholesale basis to retailers represented less than 1% of our 2021 Fiscal Year Net sales.
Suppliers
    We source our products from approximately 5,000 suppliers, including the major irrigation equipment manufacturers, turf and ornamental fertilizer/chemical companies, and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes, and other landscape products. Some of our largest suppliers include Hunter, Rain Bird, Cresline, Oldcastle, Turf Care Supply, Bayer, NDS, Toro, Techo-Bloc, and Spears Manufacturing. Purchases from our top 10 suppliers accounted for approximately 34% of total purchases for our 2021 Fiscal Year.
    We generally procure our products through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of suppliers that we target based on a number of factors, including brand and market recognition, price, quality, product support, service levels, delivery terms, and their strategic positioning. We typically have annual supplier agreements, and while they generally do not provide for specific product pricing, many include volume-based financial incentives that we earn by meeting or exceeding purchase volume targets. Our ability to earn these volume-based incentives is an important factor in our financial results. In certain cases, we have entered into supply contracts with terms that exceed one year for the manufacture of our LESCO® branded fertilizer, some nursery goods, and grass seed, which may require us to purchase products in the future.
Competition
    The majority of our competition comes from other wholesale landscape supply distributors. Among wholesale distributors, we primarily compete against a small number of regional distributors and many small, local, privately-owned distributors. Some of our competitors carry several product categories, while others mainly focus on one product category such as irrigation, fertilizer/control, nursery goods, or hardscapes. We are one of the only wholesale distributors which carries the full line of irrigation, fertilizer and other, control products, hardscapes, landscape accessories, nursery goods, and outdoor lighting products.
    We believe our top nine largest competitors include Ewing, Heritage Landscape Supply Group (a subsidiary of SRS Distribution), Harrell’s, Horizon Distributors (a subsidiary of Pool Corporation), BWI, Target Specialty Products, Howard Fertilizer and Chemical, BFG Supply, and Central Turf and Irrigation Supply.
    We believe regional or local competitors comprise approximately 85% of the landscape supply industry based on 2021 Net sales. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, location, availability of materials and supplies, technical product knowledge and expertise, advisory or other service capabilities, delivery capabilities, pricing of products, and availability of credit.
Human Capital Management
    As of January 2, 2022, we employed approximately 5,700 associates, none of whom were affiliated with labor unions. We periodically administer a company-wide associate engagement survey, the most recent of which occurred in November 2021, and we believe that we have good relations with our associates. Approximately 92% of our associates are employed on a full-time, year-round basis. Our associate count currently includes approximately 450 seasonal associates, who are temporarily employed due to the weather-dependent nature of our business. An associate is anyone employed by the Company.
    At SiteOne, we believe our associates are our greatest asset and the safety, health, and wellness of our associates and their families is a top priority. The support that we offer to our associates is an important part of our vision to be a great place to work and the employer of choice in the Green Industry.
COVID-19 Response
    Our primary objective during this uncertain period is to ensure the safety of our associates and customers. We created two new sick leave policies in response to COVID-19 – quarantine pay, which allows associates who quarantine in compliance with CDC or local guidelines to stay home with pay, and a paid time off donation program, which allows associates to donate paid time off to other associates whose family members are impacted by COVID-19. As of January 2, 2022, over 2,250 associates have received quarantine pay and approximately 7,400 hours of paid time off have been donated to provide support for 121 associates that have utilized the program.
    Also, to reward exceptional performance during the challenging circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a special “thank you” payment in August 2020 to front-line branch associates. The aggregate payment totaled $1.5 million. In March 2021, we made a second special “thank you” payment to front-line branch associates to reward their ongoing work during the pandemic. In aggregate, this second payment totaled $0.4 million. In addition to the “thank you” payments, during 2021, we issued COVID-19 reward payments to associates who became fully vaccinated. As of January 2, 2022, we paid $1.0 million towards this incentive.
    SiteOne has also implemented the measures listed below to mitigate the risk of exposure at our branches and field support offices:
•Requiring associates who are not fully vaccinated to wear face coverings inside branches, warehouses, offices, vehicles, and outside in branch yards;
•Asking customers to follow all state and local face covering legal requirements while in branches and offices;
•Reducing non-essential travel for associates and canceling certain events and company gatherings to help limit exposure;
•Asking associates not to travel to any high-risk areas identified by the CDC;
•Sanitizing and disinfecting checkout areas, equipment, restrooms, and other shared areas on a regular basis; and
•Equipping all locations with additional cleaning and sanitizing supplies and instruction on how to properly disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
Safety
    The first element of our SiteOne DNA is “Always Safe,” which means that we take personal responsibility for our own safety and for the safety of others. Our leadership team is focused on creating a culture of safety and evaluating ways to improve our operations that reduce the most common forms of on-the-job injuries. Our safety initiatives include:
•Our Environmental, Health, and Safety team which further enhances our safety efforts by establishing and monitoring safe work practices to prevent customer and associate injuries. As a result, we invest in safety equipment and practices at all branches with the goal of eliminating workplace injuries.
•A designated Safety Champion in each of our branches. Our Safety Champions are high potential, well-respected associates who help demonstrate and influence our culture of safety. Our goal is a robust culture of safety with all associates committed to working safely, every task, every day, 100% of the time.
Diversity and Inclusion
    We believe in the power of teamwork and in creating a great place to work for all our associates, no matter their race, age, gender, sexual orientation, or military status. At SiteOne, a culture in which all our associates are respected and valued is critical. Our diversity and inclusion efforts focus on creating a work environment that is respectful and supportive of each of our associates and which places the team first. Our initiatives include the following:
•Metrics intended to increase the Company’s diversity in certain field and field support associates’ short-term incentive bonus plans.
•Associate Resource Groups (“ARGs”) which are voluntary, employee-led groups tied to an aspect of diversity. Membership in each ARG is open to all SiteOne associates and diverse representation is encouraged. ARGs support business objectives, create diversity awareness, and offer an avenue of development for associates. Our ARGs include the following:
▪Black Resource Inclusion and Diversity Group for Excellence – BR1DGE provides a network for Black associates to be connected and supported, and to process and discuss life experiences in a safe space.
▪UN1DOS – UN1DOS aims to attract and retain engaged and diverse associates while enhancing SiteOne’s understanding of and relationships with Hispanic communities and customers.
▪VETS1 – VETS1 fosters an environment of diverse and engaged associates while developing SiteOne’s understanding of and relationships with Veteran associates, customers, and communities.
▪Women in the Green Growing – W1GG promotes an environment of diverse and engaged associates while advocating female growth within SiteOne and the Green Industry.
•The creation of a Diversity & Inclusion Council during 2020 that consists of ARG leaders, select operational and functional leaders, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and our Chief Executive Officer. The Council assists executive leadership in the creation and execution of the Company’s inclusion strategy, including key action items and milestones.
•Increasing Spanish-speaking capabilities in our branches, with the goal to employ at least one Spanish-speaking associate in each branch.
Benefits
    We offer a competitive benefits package with the goal of enabling our associates to get the most out of work and life. In 2021, we added a paid military leave benefit that provides additional resources to our full-time associates as they continue to serve our country. We also adjusted our PTO carry-over rule for 2021 to allow associates to carry over additional hours into 2022. In 2020, we added a paid parental leave benefit for our full-time associates to help new parents during the early days of parenthood. The parental leave benefit provides time away from work within the first year of the birth or adoption of a child with 100% of base pay.
Training and Development
    We believe that the training provided through our development programs and our entrepreneurial, performance-based culture provide significant benefits to our associates. Targeted skill development training is designed around an associate’s development and career interests. We offer certification programs that include instructor-led training, online learning, in-field work, and exit exams. We also facilitate leadership training to develop an understanding of leadership style, our values, and key coaching techniques.
Engagement
    We administer associate engagement surveys to determine how we are doing in our mission to be the employer of choice in the Green Industry. We review the survey results with all of our associates and seek their involvement in developing and executing action plans to continue our workplace improvements. We monitor associate satisfaction and aim to strengthen our pipeline of top talent by conducting talent reviews and succession planning for all critical roles in the organization. We identify, communicate, and utilize career development paths for key roles. This includes not only a path up for associates, but exposure to parallel roles across the organization.
Service Marks, Trademarks and Trade Names
    We hold various trademark registrations, including SiteOne®, LESCO®, SiteOne Green Tech®, and Pro-Trade®, which we consider important to our marketing activities. Generally, trademark rights have a perpetual life, provided they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain these trademark registrations and the other trademarks associated with our business so long as they remain valuable to our business. In addition, other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole.
Weather Conditions and Seasonality
    For a discussion regarding seasonality and weather, refer to Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Weather Conditions and Seasonality,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Compliance
Government Regulations
    We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the products and services we provide or the methods by which we offer and sell those products and services or conduct our business, and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
    These federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, wage and hour, deceptive trade practices, permitting and licensing, state contractor laws, workers’ safety, tax, healthcare reforms, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental, and employee benefits.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
    We are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws that regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, handling, treatment, storage, disposal, and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our associates and users of our products, and impose liability for investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances at sites we have ever owned, leased or operated, or used as a disposal site.
    In the United States, we are regulated under many environmental, health and safety laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, each as amended. Certain laws, such as those requiring the registration of herbicides and pesticides, and regulating their use, also involve the oversight of regulatory authorities and public health agencies. Although we strive to comply with such laws and have processes in place designed to achieve compliance, we may be unable to prevent violations of these or other laws from occurring. We could also incur significant investigation and clean-up costs for contamination at any currently or formerly owned or operated facilities, including LESCO’s manufacturing and blending facilities.
