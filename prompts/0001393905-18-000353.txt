  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  Overview
  Commencing in February 2018, through our subsidiary, Power Blockchain LLC (Power Blockchain), we began operating a start-up venture that specializes in blockchain mining for the Bitcoin network, the computer intensive process required to verify and record the digital exchange of money for crypto-currency transactions. In exchange for processing these complex mathematical equations, we will be rewarded with digital currency. We have yet to commence meaningful operations, and will require new capital investment to execute upon our business strategy.  Our business plan is to build a cryptocurrency mining operation, operating specialized computers (also known as crypto-currency miners") that generate cryptocurrency (primarily Bitcoin). A bitcoin is an asset that can be transferred among parties via the Internet, but without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency. The term decentralized is often used in descriptions of bitcoin, in reference to bitcoins lack of necessity for administration by a central party.  1    As further indicated below (see Our Operations), the results of our initial crypto-currency mining operations have been inconclusive to date, therefore, we are currently evaluating our strategic alternatives going forward.  Our Industry
  Bitcoin mining utilizes a combination of computer hardware and software to accomplish a dual purpose: (i) to verify the authenticity and validity of bitcoin transactions (i.e. the movement of bitcoin between addresses), and (ii) the creation of new bitcoin. Bitcoin miners do not need permission to participate in verifying transactions. Rather, miners compete to solve a prescribed and complicated mathematical calculation using computers dedicated to the task. Rounds of the competition repeat approximately every ten minutes. In any particular round of the competition, the first miner to find the solution to the mathematical calculation is the miner who gains the privilege of announcing the next block to be added to the blockchain.  A new block that is added to the blockchain serves to take all of the recent-yet-unconfirmed transactions and verify that none are fraudulent. The recent-yet-unconfirmed transactions also generally contain transaction fees that are awarded to the miner who produces the block in which the transactions are inserted, and thereby confirmed. The successful miner also earns the so-called block reward, an amount of newly created bitcoin. Thus, bitcoin miners are financially incentivized to conduct their work. The financial incentives received by bitcoin miners are a vital part of the process by which the Bitcoin network functions.  Upon successfully wining a round of the competition (winning a round is referred to as mining a new block), the miner then transmits a copy of the newly-formed block to peers on the Bitcoin network, all of which then update their respective copies of the blockchain by appending the new block, thereby acknowledging the confirmation of the transactions that had previously existed in an unconfirmed state. A recipient of bitcoin must wait until a new block is formed in order to see the transaction convert from an unconfirmed state to a confirmed state.  Bitcoins mining process is the innovation that allows it to function without a central arbiter. Transactions are initially in an unconfirmed state because they must be checked for any attempt at a so-called double-spend. A double spend would occur if Party A were to send the same bitcoin both to Party B and to Party C. No payment system can be sound if it permits double spends. In a payment system with a central administrator (i.e., payments sent through a bank), the job of preventing double spends falls to the central administrator. Bitcoins mining process is the mechanism by which it prohibits double spends yet remains without a central administrator.  Party A could attempt a double-spend - the sending of the same bitcoin both to Parties B and C - by creating two digitally signed transactions. The first transaction would propose to transfer the bitcoin from Party A to Party B and the second to Party C. Party A would then broadcast both transactions to the Bitcoin network, and all participating computers would generally see both transactions in a matter of seconds. The transactions would, initially, be in an unconfirmed state, and no participant on the Bitcoin network would be able to know which of the two transactions to verify and which to reject. Participants would, however, know that only one of the transactions can be permitted to exist, and that all participants need somehow to agree which transaction to permit and which to reject.  When a miner successfully mines a new block, it eliminates the attempted double spend by choosing only one of the unconfirmed transactions and discarding the other. Thus, the miner serves as the arbiter in resolving any attempted double spends. The miners choice of which transaction to include in the block can be arbitrary. The only requirement, for the soundness of the system, is that only one of the two transactions is included. When the miner broadcasts the newly created block to participants in the Bitcoin network, each participant will know which of the two transactions is valid and which is invalid. If the miner were to attempt to include both transactions in the block, participants on the Bitcoin network would immediately know that the block is invalid, and they would discard it. From a systemic perspective, the miners most important function is to be an arbiter in the case of any attempted double spend, thus maintaining the soundness of the Bitcoin network.   2    Beyond being the arbiter in case of an attempted double spend, miners also serve to generate newly created bitcoin. A miners probability of successfully generating a new block is proportional to the amount of computing power the miner employs as a proportion of the total amount of computing power dedicated to mining. Although the aggregate amount of computing power devoted to bitcoin mining tends to increase over time, the quantity of bitcoin generated each day does not. By design, the supply of bitcoin is finite, and the pace at which bitcoin is generated is fixed, and set to decrease by half every four years on a defined schedule.  If an individual miner adds computing power to its mining operation, it will increase its probability of successfully generating new blocks, and simultaneously reduce the probability of other miners generating new blocks, but the overall quantity of new blocks generated will not increase. By intention, bitcoin mining is setup to be a race amongst miners in which miners are incentivized to add computing power over time, in order to protect themselves from the consequences of increases in computing power by other miners. Since the number of blocks generated is fixed, a miner can gain only a temporary advantage by adding computing power, and the advantage dissipates as other miners add computing power to their own respective mining operations.  The race among miners to add processing power is a feature of Bitcoin that keeps the Bitcoin network secure. The protocol underlying Bitcoin operates safely so long as no miner gains control of more than 50 percent of the mining processing power. If a miner gains control of more than 50 percent of mining processing power, the network will still operate safely, so long as the miner has no nefarious goals. The addition of mining processing power makes it continuously more difficult for a nefarious miner to gain control of more than 50 percent of mining processing power.  Our Operations
  On February 14, 2018, we were granted permission from the Kingdom of Lesotho to conduct crypto-currency mining operations in Lesotho. As part of this permission, we were permitted to operate by the Lesotho Electricity Company and we negotiated an electric rate agreement. As of the date of this report, we owned 70 crypto-currency miners and Power Control Units (PCU), 50 of which have been installed in Lesotho, 10 of which are in customs in South Africa, and 10 of which are in storage in South Africa. We commenced mining operations in Lesotho but have not recorded any revenues to date.  We operate from a rented facility capable of hosting mining operations. We secured this modest size space on an as needed basis without a long term lease agreement. We have completed a space infrastructure build out to support our mining operations, such as electricity connections, sound proofing, air conditioning, de-humidification, and IT networking and engaged a manager for site supervision.  Due to various economic and market conditions, which have been largely out of our ability to control effectively, the results of our initial crypto-currency mining operations have been inconclusive to date. Therefore, we are currently evaluating our strategic alternatives going forward.  Corporate History
  We were incorporated on February 22, 2013 as PowerMedChairs, a Nevada corporation. Since our incorporation until February 2018, our plan of operation was to re-build primarily electric/power wheelchairs in disrepair. On June 2, 2017, we changed our name to Holly Brothers Pictures, Inc. As discussed above, in February 2018, we ceased this business and commenced our blockchain mining business through our acquisition of Power Blockchain described below.     3    On February 1, 2018, we entered into an exchange agreement pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Power Blockchain from the owners of Power Blockchain in exchange for the issuance for convertible notes in aggregate principal amount of $2.2 million. The notes: (i) mature five years from the date of issuance: (ii) accrue interest at 5% per annum; (iii) require repayment in four equal installments on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates after issuance; and (iv) are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of $0.13 per share. Upon consummation of the exchange agreement, Power Blockchain became our wholly owned subsidiary. Power Blockchain had outstanding debt obligations in aggregate principal amounts of $570,000, accruing interest at rates between 12-13% per annum, which obligations were overdue and in default. In March 2018, the Power Blockchain debt holders commenced a lawsuit against us in San Diego Superior Court, in connection with outstanding and overdue debt obligations. On March 22, 2018, we agreed to enter into a conditional settlement with the debt holders. The settlement agreement calls for the periodic issuance to the debt holders, subject to certain ownership and temporal limitations, of an aggregate of up to 3,078,000 and 3,157,000 shares respectively, exempted from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the California Corporations Code Section 25017(f)(3), as amended, after a fairness hearing evaluating the relative merits of the proposed agreement, which was held and approved on April 2, 2018.  Competition
  In cryptocurrency mining, companies, individuals and groups generate units of cryptocurrency through mining. Miners can range from individual enthusiasts to professional mining operations with dedicated data centers. Miners may organize themselves in mining pools. A mining pool is created when cryptocurrency miners pool their processing power over a network and mine transactions together. Rewards are then distributed proportionately to each miner based on the work power contributed. Mining pools became popular when mining difficulty increased. Mining pools allow miners to pool their resources so they can generate blocks quickly and receive rewards (i.e., fractions or units of cryptocurrency) on a consistent basis instead of mining alone where rewards may not be received for long periods. We compete or may in the future compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on owning or operating cryptocurrency exchanges, developing programming for the blockchain, and mining activities. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable.  Government Regulation
  Government Regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency is largely non-existent at present and is being actively considered by the United States federal government via a number of agencies (SEC, CFTC, Federal Trade Commission and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network the U.S. Department of the Treasury) and in other countries. State government regulations also may apply to certain activities such as cryptocurrency exchanges (bitlicense, banking and money transmission regulations) and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business.  Blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations are in a nascent state with agencies investigating businesses and their practices, gathering information, and generally trying to understand the risks and uncertainties in order to protect investors in these businesses and in cryptocurrencies generally. Regulations will certainly increase, in many cases, although it is presently not possible to know how they will increase, how regulations will apply to our businesses, or when they will be effective. Various bills have also proposed in congress for adoption related to our business which may be adopted and have an impact on us. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, including for our mining and other activities.     4    Intellectual Property
  We actively use specific hardware and software for our cryptocurrency mining operation. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be subject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, we intend to adhere to the terms of any license agreements that may be in place. We do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others.  Employees
  As of March 31, 2018, we had no permanent employees and two part-time contractors/consultants.  Legal Proceedings
  We are not subject to any litigation.
