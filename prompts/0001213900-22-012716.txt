BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Genie Energy Ltd. is a global provider of energy services. We manage our business and reports results through three segments. Genie Retail Energy ("GRE"), which supplies electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers in certain portions deregulated markets within the United States. Genie Retail Energy International ("GRE International"), which supplies electricity to residential and small business customers in Scandinavia. Genie Renewables, which includes the following four lines of businesses. Genie Solar Energy ("Genie Solar"), which designs and build local solar installation for commercial size customers, CityCom Solar, which recruits customers to purchase electricity generated by community solar fields, Prism Solar Technologies ("Prism"), which designs and manufactures niche solar panels for wholesale distribution and Diversegy LLC ("Diversegy"), an energy broker for commercial customers. 

The Company owns 99.5% of its subsidiary, Genie Energy International Corporation ("GEIC"), which owns 100% of Genie Retail Energy, Inc., 100% of Genie Retail Energy International LLC, and 95.5% of Genie Energy Services, LLC that holds our interest in the entities comprising the Genie Renewables segment. In March 2021, the Company renamed the Genie Energy Services ("GES") segment to Genie Renewables.

GRE owns and operates retail energy providers ("REPs"), including IDT Energy, Inc. ("IDT Energy"), Residents Energy, LLC ("Residents Energy"), Town Square Energy, LLC and Town Square Energy East, LLC ("collectively, "TSE"), Southern Federal Power ("SFP") and Mirabito Natural Gas, ("Mirabito"). GRE's REP businesses resell electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers. The majority of GRE's REPs' customers are located in the Eastern and Midwestern United States and Texas. Mirabito supplies natural gas to commercial customers in Florida. 

GRE International holds the Company's interest in REPs that serve retail customers in Scandinavia. It holds a 90.8% controlling interest in Lumo Energia Oyj ("Lumo Finland"), a REP serving residential customers in Finland and 97.7% of Lumo Energi AB ("Lumo Sweden"), which serves retail customers in Sweden. GRE International previously held a 98.8% interest in Genie Japan that was sold in May 2021. GREI holds a 100% ownership of Orbit Energy Limited ("Orbit"), a REP operating in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). On November 29, 2021, Orbit Energy Limited ("Orbit") was declared insolvent and its customers were transferred to the “supplier of last resort.” Effective December 1, 2021, the administration of Orbit has been transferred to third-party Administrators. The Company accounted for the transaction as discontinued operations and the accounts of Orbit were deconsolidated effective December 1, 2021.

Genie Renewables consists of our 100% interest in Genie Solar, a rooftop solar system sales and general contracting company, our 93.5% interest in CityCom Solar, a marketer of community solar energy solutions, our 60.0%  controlling interest in Prism, a solar solutions company that is engaged in U.S based manufacturing of solar panels, solar installation design and solar energy project management and 100% interest in Diversegy, an energy broker for customers.

CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19)  

Starting in the first quarter of 2020, the world and the United States experienced the unprecedented impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 were evident in several key aspect of our business operations and the corresponding financial impact has been mixed. Our customers are predominantly residential, so we benefited from the increased demand for electricity as many customers are working from and spending more time in their homes. On the other hand, like other retail energy providers, the Company suspended its face-to-face customer acquisition programs in March 2020 as public health measures were implemented to combat COVID-19, resulting in a decrease in gross meter acquisitions. The reduction in gross meter acquisitions decreased customer acquisition expenses in 2021 and 2020 and limited growth in domestic meters served. Churn in 2021 and 2020 decreased, as our competitors also suspended their face-face marketing programs. COVID-19 public health restrictions relaxed in some of GRE's domestic market in 2021, facilitating a partial reactivation of the previously curtailed customer acquisition channels.

BUSINESS

Genie Retail Energy

Overview
 
GRE is comprised of REPs and related businesses. GRE’s REP businesses purchase electricity and/or natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their residential and business customers in deregulated markets in the United States. The positive difference between the net sales price of electricity and natural gas sold to its customers and the cost of their electricity and natural gas supplies and related costs are the REP businesses’ gross profits. 
 
GRE’s U.S. REP businesses operate in certain utility territories within the deregulated retail energy markets of sixteen states in the United States: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Rhode Island and Texas, as well as in Washington, D.C. As part of our ongoing business development efforts, we evaluate opportunities in other deregulated jurisdictions to accelerate the growth of our customer base and to reduce operational and regulatory risk associated with geographical concentration.
 
GRE’s REP businesses operate under several brand names including IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy, Southern Federal Power and Mirabito. GRE's diverse offerings, in both the electricity and natural gas markets included either variable rate or fixed rate offerings or both. Throughout their markets, GRE's REPs offer green electricity and natural gas. Green electricity supply is matched with renewable energy certificates, or RECs that reflect the generation of electricity from renewable sources. Green natural gas supply is matched with carbon offsets certificates generated mostly from greenhouse emission reduction projects.

Historically, GRE has expanded its REP businesses through organic growth of its REPs adding new customers through customer acquisition programs at a rate faster than customers lost through attrition or churn – as well as through acquisitions of other REPs and books of business. New customers are generally acquired through a combination of marketing and sales channels including door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, online and digital marketing, direct mail, and by competitive bidding for exclusive contracts awarded by certain municipalities, where authorized by state laws. These municipal aggregation contracts award participating residents’ electricity supply to a single supplier at a fixed price that is typically established through a competitive bidding process. 
 
  
GRE evaluates its customers base both in terms of the numbers of commodity meters served and the number of Residential Customer Equivalents ("RCEs") represented by these meters. An RCE is a unit of measure denoting the typical annual commodity consumption of a single-family residential customer. One RCE represents 1,000 therms of natural gas or 10,000 kWh of electricity.
Customer churn is a significant factor in the REP business. GRE's REPs monthly churn rates average between four and seven percent per month. Customer churn tends to decrease when commodity prices fall, when weather-driven consumption decreases, when the price to REP customers decreases relative to competitors including the incumbent utility provider, or when the REPs incentivize customer tenure. Customer churn tends to increase when commodity prices rise, when weather driven consumption increases or spikes, or when the price to REP customers increases relative to the prices charged by competitors including incumbent utility providers. Newly acquired customers typically have higher rates of churn than longer-tenured customers. 
 
GRE’s revenue comprises approximately 85.7% and 85.3% of our total consolidated revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, GRE generated revenue of $311.8 million comprised of $273.0 million from sales of electricity and $38.8 million from sales of natural gas, as compared with revenue of $304.5 million in 2020, comprised of $270.9 million from the sales of electricity, $33.6 million from the sales of natural gas and a minimal amount of other revenue. GRE's electricity sales as a percentage of total sales have increased in recent years.
 
GRE’s REP revenue is seasonal. Approximately 44.5% and 47.7% of our natural gas revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were generated during the first quarter, when the demand for heating peaks. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas, approximately 30.3% and 31.8% of total revenues from electricity sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were generated in the third quarter when the demand for cooling peaks.
 
Unusual weather patterns can significantly impact GRE’s financial results. For example, a polar vortex resulted in unusually sustained cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. This increased demand was characterized by extraordinarily large spikes in the wholesale prices GRE paid for its electricity and natural gas supplies. As a result, GRE's REP experience abnormally high rates of churn and the Company refunded a significant amount to its variable rate customers to cushion the impacts on their monthly bills. 

As discussed above, in February 2021, the Company experienced unprecedented price volatility in Texas markets due to weather conditions which adversely affected our consolidated results of operations.
Potential global climate change may produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in unusual weather conditions, more intense, frequent and extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Some climatologists believe that these extreme weather events will become more common and more extreme which will have a greater impact on our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, GRE serviced 285,000 meters (210,000 electric and 75,000 natural gas), compared to 370,000 meters (305,000 electric and 65,000 natural gas) as of December 31, 2020. 
 
REP Industry Overview
 
REPs operate in deregulated retail energy markets in the US. REPs purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their customers including homeowners, renters and small to mid-sized commercial and governmental operations and institutions. Generally, incumbent local utilities continue to handle electricity and natural gas distribution, billing, and collections. The utilities remit the proceeds collected for the commodity supply portion of their bills less certain fees to the REPs.
 
REPs generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenue is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets and other factors. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and purchase of receivables, or POR, fees paid to the utilities, and program management.
 
As of December 31, 2021, there were thirty U.S. states in which there is some level of energy deregulation. We currently market in all the states where residential deregulation covers both electricity and natural gas, and in some states, where residential deregulation covers only one commodity. We are in the process of applying for licenses or setting up operations in certain such states and are constantly evaluating market opportunities in others. 

Some competitors in certain REP markets have engaged in unfair business practices in order to recruit new customers. These practices can create an unfavorable impression about our industry with consumers, regulators or political bodies. Further, such practices can lead to regulatory action that negatively impact us and the industry.

  Customers; Marketing
 
The services of GRE’s U.S. REPs - IDT Energy, Residents Energy, TSE, SFP and Mirabito - are made available to customers under several offerings with distinct terms and conditions. The offerings include variable rate programs whose prices change month-to-month, fixed contracts whose unit price remains the same for the agreed upon term and renewable contracts. A significant portion of our customer base is enrolled in variable rate products, which enable us to recover our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas by adjusting the rates we charge to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments are determined by GRE. Variable rate products are available to all customers in all states served by GRE’s REPs except for Connecticut.

As of December 31, 2021, customers on variable rate products constituted approximately 74.6% of our electric load. The balance comprised customers on fixed rate agreements. 
 
GRE’s REPs offer renewable or green energy supply options in all their markets. Renewable electricity supply is 100% matched with renewable energy certificates, or RECs, that reflect the generation of electricity from sources such as hydro-electric wind, solar and biomass.
 
The electricity and natural gas we sell through all of our offerings are metered and delivered to customers by the local utilities. The utilities also provide billing and collection services for the majority of our customers. For a small number of customers, we perform our own billing and collection. 

In many states, GRE’s REPs’ receivables are purchased by the utilities in their territories for a percentage of their face value. Over the course of 2021, the associated cost was approximately 1.0% of GRE's revenue in exchange, the utility accepts a first priority lien against the customer receivable without recourse to the REP. Programs operating within this framework are preferred to as purchase of receivables, or POR, programs, and they mitigate our credit risk. At December 31, 2021, 80.8% of GRE’s net accounts receivables were under a POR program.

Certain utilities in Connecticut, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Maryland offer POR programs, without recourse. These programs permit customers with past-due balances to remain in the POR and consolidated bill programs. However, utilities in New Jersey generally do not permit customers with past-due balances beyond 120 days to enroll or remain in their POR programs. After a certain amount of time (determined based on the specific commodity), the REP becomes responsible for the billing and collection of the commodity portion of the future invoices for its delinquent customers. Certain utilities in Delaware, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio and Rhode Island do not offer POR, but they do offer consolidated billing. In Florida and Texas, there are no POR programs and the customers are billed directly.
 
GRE targets markets in which we can procure energy in an efficient and transparent manner. We seek to purchase wholesale energy where there is a real-time market that reflects a fair commodity price for all participants. This allows GRE to reflect a true market cost base and adjust its rates to its variable rate customers taking into account prevailing market rates.
 
We regularly monitor deregulated or deregulating markets in states where we do not yet operate to determine whether and under what conditions we could operate profitability. We may initiate the licensing process in a selected region to facilitate entry into that region contingent upon favorable deregulatory developments.

  Procurement and Management of Gas and Electric Supply

Certain of GRE's REPs are party to an Amended and Restated Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company, or BP, through November 30, 2023. Under the agreement, the REPs purchase electricity and natural gas at market rate plus a fee. The obligations to BP are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of the REP’s customer’s receivables, and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with BP. The ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. 
 
GRE is required to meet certain minimum green energy supply criteria in many of the markets in which it operates. We meet those thresholds by acquiring renewable energy certificates, or REC’s. In addition, GRE offers green or other renewable energy products to its customers in all of the territories in which we operate. GRE acquires green renewable energy conversion rights or attributes and REC’s to satisfy the load requirements for these customers.
 
GRE does not own electrical power generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, or natural gas production, pipeline or distribution facilities. For their natural gas supply, GRE’s REPs currently contract with Dominion Transmission, Inc., National Fuel Supply, Williams Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission and others for natural gas pipeline, storage and transportation services. For electricity supply, they, utilize the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO, and PJM Interconnection, LLC, or PJM, for electric transmission and distribution. NYISO operates the high-voltage electric transmission network in New York State, and administers and monitors New York’s wholesale electricity markets. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of thirteen states (including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois) and the District of Columbia. In Texas, SFP acquires power through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).
 
For risk management purposes, GRE’s REPs utilize forward physical delivery contracts for a portion of their purchases of electricity and natural gas, which are defined as commodity derivative contracts. In addition, GRE’s REPs enter into put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity and natural gas.
 
The ISOs perform real-time load balancing for each of the electrical power grids in which GRE REPs operate. Similarly, load balancing is performed by the utilities or local distribution company, or LDC, for each of the natural gas markets in which GRE operates. Load balancing ensures that the amount of electricity and natural gas that GRE’s REPs purchase is equal to the amount necessary to service its customers’ demands at any specific point in time. GRE’s REPs are charged or credited for balancing the electricity and natural gas purchased and sold for their account by their suppliers and the LDCs. GRE’s REPs manage the differences between the actual electricity and natural gas demands of their customers and their bulk or block purchases by buying and selling in the spot market, and through monthly cash settlements and/or adjustments to future deliveries in accordance with the load balancing performed by utilities, LDCs, and/or ISOs.

Competition
 
As an operator of REPs, GRE often competes with the local utility companies in each of the markets in which it provides services and with many other licensed REPs. In some markets, competitor REPs are affiliated with local utilities. GRE also competes with several large vertically integrated energy companies as well as smaller independent operators. Competition with the utilities and REPs impacts GRE’s gross margins, customer acquisition rates and exposes GRE to customer churn.
 
REPs and utilities offering fixed rate products or guaranteed pricing often are unable to change their sell rates offered to customers in response to underlying commodity price volatility. In a downward moving commodity cost environment, variable rate REPs typically become more competitive as they benefit from the lag that utilities experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower commodity costs, and they may benefit from decreases in margin pressure, improvements in the customer acquisition environment, and lower rates of churn. In a rising commodity cost environment, REPs that offer variable rate products, and reflect real-time commodity costs, will typically become less competitive with fixed rate providers, experience increased margin pressure, a more challenging customer acquisition environment and higher rates of customer churn.
 
Increasing our market share depends in part on our ability to persuade more customers to switch from other providers to one of our REPs at a higher rate than our customers churn to other providers. Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GRE requires significant marketing and sales operations.
 
Regulation 
 
REPs such as ours must be licensed in each state and utility service territory in which they operate. Each is subject to the rules and regulations governing the operations of REPs in each jurisdiction.

Although the rates charged by GRE’s REPs are not regulated in the same way as the rates of utility companies, the manner in which the REPs market to potential customers, and the relationships between the REPs and their customers, are heavily regulated. GRE’s REPs must also comply with various quarterly and/or annual reporting requirements in order to maintain their eligibility to provide service. In certain jurisdictions the REPs are required to publish product offers with the applicable regulatory commissions, or in the public domain, generally on a website established for such purpose. In addition to the regulations that govern the relationships between GRE’s REPs and their customers, GRE’s REPs also maintain specific Terms & Conditions or Terms of Service for each product in each jurisdiction that the parties agree to be bound by.
 
The Company is party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including those with utility commissions or other government regulatory or law enforcement agencies. 

As of December 31, 2021, GRE’s REPs operate in Washington D.C., New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maine, Texas and Georgia. The federal government and related public service/utility commissions, among others, establish the rules and regulations for our REP operations

Like all operators of REPs, GRE is affected by the actions of governmental agencies, mostly on the state level, by the respective state Public Service/Utility Commissions, and other organizations (such as NYISO, ERCOT and PJM) and indirectly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Regulations applicable to electricity and natural gas have undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. We may be subject to new laws, orders or regulations or the revision or interpretation of existing laws, orders or regulations.
 New York Public Service Commission Orders

Effective April 16, 2021, the PSC issued orders adopting changes to the New York retail energy market (“2021 Orders”). The 2021 Orders limits the types of services energy retailer marketers may offer new customers or renewals, in terms of pricing for non-renewable commodities, and renewable product offerings. Although the Company's products and services are fully compatible with the 2021 Orders, such compliance may adversely impact customer acquisition and renewal revenue and profitability. As of December 31, 2021, New York represented 22.4% of GRE’s total meters served and 18.8%of the total residential customer equivalents (“RCEs”) of GRE’s customer base. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, New York gross revenues were $52.9 million and $56.7 million, respectively.

A RCE represents a natural gas customer with annual consumption of 100 mmbtu or an electricity customer with annual consumption of 10 MWh. Because different customers have different rates of energy consumption, RCEs are an industry standard metric for evaluating the consumption profile of a given retail customer base.

State of Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority
 Town Square Energy

On September 19, 2018, the State of Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (“PURA”) commenced an investigation into Town Square following customer complaints of allegedly misleading and deceptive sales practices on the part of Town Square. The Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel had joined in the investigation. Although Town Square denies any basis for those complaints and any wrongdoing on its part, it cooperated with the investigation and responded to subpoenas for discovery. On June 17, 2020, the PURA notified Town Square that it was advancing its investigation by assigning Prosecutorial staff for the purpose of investigating Town Square’s compliance with licensed electric supplier billing, marketing, and licensing requirements, and, if appropriate, facilitating settlement discussions among the parties that contains, but is not limited to, an appropriate civil penalty, extensive retraining of the supplier’s third-party agents, and retention of all sales calls with continued auditing. 

 In July 2021, the parties settled the dispute. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Town Square paid $0.4 million. Town Square has also, and has agreed to voluntarily refrain, from in-person marketing activities in Connecticut for the period of 15 months. As of December 31, 2021, Town Square’s Connecticut customer base represented 4.8% of GRE’s total meters served and 5.6% of the total RCEs of GRE’s customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Town Square’s gross revenues from sales in Connecticut was $29.0 million.

   Residents Energy

In August 2020, Residents Energy began marketing retail energy services in Connecticut. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Residents Energy's gross revenues from sales in Connecticut were $0.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the enforcement division of PURA contacted Residents Energy concerning customer complaints received in connection with alleged door-to-door marketing activities in violation of various rules and regulations. On March 12, 2021, the enforcement division filed a motion against Resident Energy with the adjudicating body of PURA, seeking the assessment of $1.5 million in penalties, along with a suspension of license, auditing of marketing practices upon reinstatement and an invitation for settlement discussions. 

In September 2021, the parties settled the dispute. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Residents Energy paid $0.3 million and volunteered to withdraw from the market in Connecticut for a period of 36 months.

Employees

As of March 4, 2022, GRE employed 131 full time employees, 53 of whom are located in the Jamestown, New York office, 52 of whom are located in our New Jersey office, 21 of whom are located in our Arizona office and 5 are located in Texas with SFP.
Environment

 In March 2021, the Biden Administration announced a framework for the "Build Back Better" agenda. The proposed framework included policies to address climate change across the federal government through the tax code, an energy efficiency and clean energy standard, research and development, among other areas of focus. 

 In April 2021, President Biden announced that the United States' Nationally Defined Contribution to the international Paris Climate Agreement will be an economy-wide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") emissions of 50-52% by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. In advance of the November 2021 Conference of the Parties 26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, the Biden Administration released details on its strategy to achieve those targets as part of the "Build Back Better" agenda. 

 In addition to climate-related initiatives at the federal level, some states have adopted provisions designed to regulate GHG emissions for some industry sectors. The adoption and implementation of any foreign laws or regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting GHG emissions from, our equipment and operations could adversely affect pricing or demand for our offerings. We may not be able to pass on increases in costs to customers. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products and carbon-emitting fuel sources that are deemed to contribute to climate change, or restrict the use of such products or fuel sources, may reduce demand for our offerings or impact the energy supply markets.
  GRE International

GRE International is comprised of REPs operating in Finland, through our 90.8% interest in Lumo Finland and in Sweden through our 87,7% interest in Lumo Sweden. GRE International’s REP businesses purchase electricity on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their residential customers through both variable rate and fixed rate programs.

As discussed above, in January 2021, the Company experienced unprecedented price volatility in the Japanese market due to weather conditions which adversely affected our consolidated results of operations. In May 2021, we completed the sale of Genie Japan.

GRE International's REP businesses in Scandinavia operate under the Lumo Energia brand name. 

As of December 31, 2021, GRE International's REPs, served 67,000 meters, a decrease from 88,000 meters as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was mostly due to the sale of Genie Japan in second quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, GRE International served 40,000 RCEs, a decrease from 57,000 RCEs as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in RCEs primarily resulted from the sale of Genie Japan and the decision to slow down marketing in Sweden.

Nordic Electricity Market

Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden (together, Lumo) serve the Nordic electricity market. 

The Nordic electricity system utilizes a mixture of generation sources, including hydro, nuclear biomass and wind power. The Nordic region has a large share of electricity heated houses, resulting in a consumption profile that is higher than in the rest of the European Union (“EU”). Electricity consumption is highly dependent on weather factors, with lower electricity demand in the summer and increased consumption in the wintertime.

Lumo generally has no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Lumo's cost of revenue is incurred through the purchase of electricity in their wholesale markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customers acquisitions, customer retention, billing and collections.

 In Finland, green electricity is covered by GoO-certificates which REPs can acquire directly from producers or other relevant market participants that operate within the European Economic Area (EEA). Electricity that is not covered by GoOs is from mixed sources, mainly energy from fossil sources. Finnish REPs are required to disclose the mix of electricity sold in the preceding year. Sweden has its own nationally supported certificate scheme called “elcert” whereby accredited generation assets receive one “elcert” per MWh produced. Demand for these certificates is created by a legal obligation placed on REPs and obligated consumers to obtain certificates sufficient to cover a given share of the power that they sell or use, respectively. 

Lumo Finland

Lumo Finland was founded in 2015 and began servicing customers in 2016. Lumo Finland operates in the Finnish electricity market. The Company acquired an 80.0% controlling interest of Lumo Finland in January 2019 and has since increased its ownership to 90.8%. Lumo Finland operates in all of Finland (excl. Ålands-islands) and sells electricity primarily to private consumers and small businesses. In addition to retail electricity, Lumo Finland also markets solar & EV-charging solutions. Lumo’s principal electricity products are Fixed, Variable and Premium rate plans.

Lumo Finland's revenue is seasonal. Approximately 65.7% of total revenues in 2021 were generated in the winter (27.6% in first quarter of 2021 and 38.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021) when the demand for heating is high. Approximately 63.3% of total revenues in 2020 were generated in the winter (27.5%  in the first quarter of 2020 and 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020).

 In Finland, Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) is being replaced by a centralized DataHub in first quarter of 2022 through which information exchange between market participants is expected to be nearly real time. Lumo Finland expects that the implementation of DataHub may enable it to offer new products and services that provide customers options to take advantage of smart energy management.

Lumo Sweden

Lumo Sweden is a Swedish REP founded in October 2019 and commenced commercial operations in April 2020. Its customers are spread across Sweden, and are primarily residential with some being small businesses. Since the start of commercial operations, Lumo Sweden has focused on growing its customer base, improving brand recognition and increasing digital sales.

The Swedish electricity market is divided into four different price regions based on geographic location. The capital Stockholm region is the biggest market for Lumo Sweden. Historically, the price for supply in the northern price areas has been lower compared to the other price regions due to the presence of a number of hydroelectric power plans and lower overall demand. The price in the south, however, has been the higher due to a higher demand with lower local supply, mostly solar and wind. Traditionally market prices are higher in the winter season due to increased demand and lower amounts of wind. In recent years, price volatility has increased in the summer months due to significant increases on wind output and changes in climate (i.e. drought). In Sweden, EDI is also expected to be replaced by a centralized DataHub but timing of the rollout uncertain.

Marketing

Lumo acquires customers both in Finland and Sweden primarily through branded and affiliated websites as opposed to traditional customer acquisition methods. Lumo's marketing efforts focus on digital channels such as search engine marketing, social media, display and email marketing and are designed to drive traffic to Lumo's branded websites. Lumo's branded site offers customers variable rate and fixed rate products. Remarketing for customers who have already visited the website is done through display advertising on both social media and search engines.
 Lumo’s variable rate in Finland is tied to the Finnish Area Price index while in Sweden the variable rate is tied to the Swedish Area Price Index. Both indexes are operated by NordPool AS. Currently, Lumo offers two types of variable rates: the first is based on monthly average prices and the other is based on the hourly price. A fixed margin per kWh is added on top of the variable rate. 

 Lumo competes and acquires customers using special initial discounts that are meant to introduce the consumer to Lumo. Lumo is mainly a consumer brand and thus is not dependent on one or a few customers. 

The customers are also offered multiple billing and payment methods in order to make payments convenient. The customer can also access their consumption through an online portal where they can access their invoices, payments, contract and other documents, as well as change their product and add upgrades (VAS). The majority of Lumo customers have commitments from 0-6 months.

Acquisition and Management of Electric Supply
 The Nordic electricity market consists of various marketplaces that are “time windows” for physical trading in electricity: the day-ahead market, the intra-day market and the balancing market. In the Nordic countries, the vast majority of trading is done on the day-ahead market (spot market), and the “system price” (which is the common Nordic price for all hours of the following 24-hour period) is crucial for price formation within other time windows including the intra-day and balancing markets and the financial market for long-term contracts.
 
The intra-day market is primarily a correction market, where participants have the opportunity to trade into balance, including adjusting any earlier trading. The intra-day market closes one hour before the delivery hour. The balancing market is trading in automatic and manual reserves used by the Nordic transmission system operators (“TSOs”) in order to maintain power balance during the hour of operation. Nord Pool Spot is responsible for the day-ahead market and the intra-day market, while the TSOs are responsible for the balancing market.

For risk management purposes, Lumo typically makes forward purchases of power to protect against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity. The purchases are usually done 3 to 12 months ahead of delivery and are based on expected volumes.
 Competition
 There are dozens of registered REPs in Finland and Sweden, including those operated by energy producers, affiliates of local grid companies and independent contractors. In recent years, the REP industry has experienced consolidation resulting in larger REPs. Most of the traditional REPs are either wholly-owned by the local municipality or the local municipality has an ownership interest in the REP. These REPs are generally defensive businesses that do not attract customers outside their local geographical area.

 A significant portion of Finland’s residential customer base continue to purchase its supply from their local grid company’s affiliate REPs despite the proliferation of competitive suppliers. Most new REPs seek to build market share with aggressive pricing. The main focus of Lumo is to gain new customers, upgrading these customers to better margin products while controlling churn and balancing growth and profitability.

 Customer churn is a significant factor in the REP business. Lumo REPs monthly churn rates average approximately four percent per month. Customer churn tends to decrease when commodity prices fall, when weather-driven consumption decreases, when the price to REP customers decreases relative to competitors (including the incumbent utility provider), or when the REPs incentivize customer tenure. Customer churn tends to increase when commodity prices rise, when weather-driven consumption increases or spikes, or when the price to REP customers increases relative to the prices charged by competitors (including incumbent utility providers). Newly acquired customers typically have higher rates of churn than longer-tenured customers.

Lumo in Finland is starting to be recognized as a prominent consumer brand, while in Sweden Lumo is still an emerging brand. 
 
   Regulation
 
Each REP in Finland or Sweden must be registered with each countries' Energy Authority in order to be able to operate. Although REPs enjoy certain freedom with respect to their operations (i.e. marketing and pricing), they must comply with various regulations and laws, including Finnish or Swedish Energy authority rules and regulations governing electricity supply pricing, marketing, types of offerings and contracts, as well as general guidelines set forth in the Finnish or Swedish Electricity Market Law. In Sweden, energy retailers are prohibited from bundling their products with other services and are limited to energy-related products and services. 
 
In the EU, there is a commitment to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and EU member states have implemented a range of subsidies and incentives to achieve the EU’s climate change goals. Further, emissions are regulated via a number of means, including the European Union Emissions Trading System (the ‘‘EU ETS’’). The EU ETS is a trading system across the EU for industrial emissions and is expected to become progressively more stringent over time, including by reducing the number of allowances to emit GHGs. 
 
 The adoption and implementation of any foreign laws or regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting GHG emissions from, our equipment and operations could adversely affect pricing or demand for our offerings. We may not be able to pass on resulting increases in costs to customers. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products and carbon-emitting fuel sources that are deemed to contribute to climate change, or restrict the use of such products or fuel sources, may reduce demand for our offerings or impact the energy supply markets.

As of March 4, 2022, GRE International employed 26 employees located in Finland.

Genie Renewables
 
Genie Renewables is comprised of businesses that market and provide energy solutions. Genie Renewables currently consists of (i) Genie Solar, (ii) CityCom Solar, (iii) our controlling interest in Prism, and (iv) Diversegy.
Solar Industry Overview
 
 Genie Solar, CityCom Solar and Prism are all engaged in different business areas within the solar industry.

Solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the price of solar power systems, and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems, has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. Worldwide solar markets continue to develop, aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable. 

Multiple markets within the United States, exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market, including (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas; (ii) strong demand for renewable energy generation; and (iii) abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation.

Regulation
 
Federal government support for renewable energy
 
The U.S. federal government provides an uncapped investment tax credit, or “Federal ITC,” that originally allowed a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a residential or commercial solar generation facility. The Tax Act did not make any changes to the existing laws surrounding tax credits for renewable energy. The Federal ITC is currently at 26% for a solar generation facility. A permanent 10% Federal ITC is available for non-residential solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2022. 
 
U.S. state government support for renewable energy
 
Many states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for renewable energy facilities, which is additive to the Federal ITC. Further, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy facilities that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Certain of our renewable energy facilities in the U.S. have been financed with a tax equity financing structure, whereby the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the solar generation facility or wind power plant and receives the benefits of various tax credits.
 
   
There are 41 states that have a regulatory policy known as net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar generation facilities to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar generation facility in excess of electric load that is exported to the grid. Some states require utilities to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds a set percentage of the utilities’ aggregate customer peak demand. 
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. Thirty states, Washington, D.C., and two territories have active renewable or clean energy requirements, while an additional 3 states and 1 territory have set voluntary renewable energy goals. Renewable portfolio standard ("RPS") legislation has seen two opposing trends in recent years. On one hand, many states with RPS targets are expanding or renewing those goals. Since 2018, 15 states, 2 territories, and Washington, D.C., have passed legislation to increase or expand their renewable or clean energy targets. On the other hand, eleven states and one territory have allowed their RPS targets to expire.

Genie Solar Energy

Genie Solar is a project developer for commercial, industrial, and community-scale solar projects. Genie Solar markets directly to commercial and industrial clients who benefit by either achieving sustainability goals, lowering the cost of energy and accruing financial benefits from federal, state, and local incentives for investing in renewable energy. In the community solar space, Genie Solar sources landowners and works with utilities and local government to construct a project that will provide local energy to the local community. Genie Solar acquires the customers and manages the project which includes managing the interconnection and permitting process, procuring the materials, and overseeing the labor involved in installing the solar system. In addition, Genie Solar arranges for third-party financing or provides in-house financing when the customer requires it.

Genie Solar differentiates itself in the market by targeting small to medium-sized businesses which have less competition and cost of doing business. It is providing in-house financing to these projects to fill a gap in the marketplace, allowing more businesses and non-profits to go solar. Genie Solar offers a custom software solution that allows property operators to have detailed insight into electricity consumption and production which further reduces expenses.

Many of the current customers and future pipeline of projects are building multiple installations across their portfolio of projects. Genie Solar has increased its product offering by selling its first battery plus solar solution for a business in upstate New York to both reduce demand charges and provide backup power in the event of a power outage.

Currently, Genie Solar focuses its marketing efforts in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, but has the ability to serve customers across the country and is actively building its pipeline of projects.

Genie Solar markets panels from Prism to both differentiate itself and drive value to its customers by having an increase in supply chain control, ethical manufacturing locations, and intimate insight into the manufacturing process. Genie Solar has also developed strategic relationships with other vendors to have a reliable supply chain and preferred pricing. 

CityCom — Community Solar

 CityCom operates primarily as a provider if service to the community solar industry. Community solar is a program that exists in various states that provides incentives to solar investors to build large solar fields for the purpose of complementing and replacing non-renewable sourced generation. In order for developers to qualify for the state-based incentives, they are required to sell the power generated to customers in the utility service territory in which the solar field is constructed. CityCom was created in order to help developers acquire customers and bill those customers for the service. CityCom employs a variety of sales channels to achieve its sales goals, mostly leveraging the sales channels that GRE has successfully executed for years. CityCom gets paid through a combination of upfront commissions and residual fees for its services.
Prism Solar Technologies 
 
The Company acquired a 60.0% controlling interest in Prism in October 2018. On April 12, 2019, Prism restructured its ownership. The Company now holds 60.0% interest in Plus EnerG which owns 100% of Prism. In the second quarter of 2020, Prism renegotiated a contract with a customer which resulted in impairment of customer relationship of $0.8 million included in the consolidated statements of operation. Prism also provided a full impairment of its remaining goodwill of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

 Prism is a solar module manufacturing company that specializes in the manufacturing of bifacial solar modules. In the U.S., Prism’s solar panels are used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Residential applications include solar swings, skylights, canopies and sun decks. Prism's solar panels are used in the construction of parking canopies, electric vehicle car ports, parking structures, vertically mounted on buildings and many other custom applications.
 
 Prism bifacial modules are engineered and designed in the U.S. utilizing manufacturing facilities in the U. S. and abroad. Prism uses high efficiency P-type PERC bifacial cells. This technology results in a reduction in the average cost per kilowatt hour. Elements of the technology that Prism uses are protected under patent application. The glass-on-glass design of the solar panels increases the durability and lifetime value of the solar panels. Unlike traditional solar modules, where photo-voltaic (“PV”) cells can only use the sunlight that strikes the front of the module, Prism’s bifacial modules generate energy on both sides, capturing a substantial amount of light scattered from clouds and surrounding surfaces. In traditional modules this additional light is not converted into electricity. Prism’s solutions are especially valuable when Prism's modules are mounted over highly reflective backgrounds, such as white roof, snow, sand, or other light-colored surfaces.

Competition

 In the solar energy space, the market is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market and reduced margins, which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to Canadian Solar Inc., Hanwha QCELLS Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., LG Corporation, Jinko Solar, Panasonic Corporation, Sharp Corporation, SunRun, Inc., Tesla, Inc., Trina Solar Ltd., Vivint, Inc., LONGi Solar, REC Group, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd. and First Solar, Inc.

 We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.

 At Diversegy, the energy brokerage market is highly competitive with a number of different competition types.

  Employees
 
As of March 4, 2022, Genie Renewables employed 15 full time employees, all of whom are located in our New Jersey office.

Climate Change

 As indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of GHG, including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing the world’s climate. Climate change could affect customer demand for the Company's product offerings. It might also cause physical damage to the energy production ecosystem that the Company's REPs rely on to procure electricity and natural gas for their customers. Additionally, climate change could affect the availability of risk management products and services that the Company REPs rely on to manage its risk position.

 In September 2016, the U.S. joined in adopting the agreement reached on December 12, 2015, at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings in Paris to reduce GHGs. The Paris Agreement’s non-binding obligations to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius became effective on November 4, 2016. Genie cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies, although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO2 emissions, or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require material capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations.

 In December 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its final “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for GHGs under the Clean Air Act (CAA),” concluding that concentrations of several key GHGs constitute an "endangerment" and may be regulated as "air pollutants" under the CAA and mandated measurement and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including electric generating units (EGU). Subsequently, the EPA released its final Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations in August 2015 to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs and finalized state regulations imposing CO2 emission limits for new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Numerous states and private parties filed appeals and motions to stay the CPP with the D.C. Circuit in October 2015. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule during the pendency of the challenges to the Washington D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court. On March 28, 2017, an executive order, entitled “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,” instructed the EPA to review the CPP and related rules addressing GHG emissions and suspend, revise or rescind the rules if appropriate. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the affordable clean energy (ACE) rule that established guidelines for states to develop standards of performance to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired generation. On January 19, 2021, the Washington D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE rule declaring that the EPA was “arbitrary and capricious” in its rule making and, as such, the ACE rule is no longer in effect and all actions thus far taken by states to implement the federally mandated rule are now null and void. The D.C. Circuit decision is subject to legal challenge. Depending on the outcomes of further appeals and how any final rules are ultimately implemented, the future cost of compliance may be material.
 The cost to the Company to comply with any legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting GHG or emissions or otherwise seeking to limit the impact of climate change could be substantial. Moreover, regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting GHG emissions from, our equipment and operations could adversely affect pricing or demand for our offerings. We may not be able to pass on increases in costs to customers. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products and carbon-emitting fuel sources that are deemed to contribute to climate change, or restrict the use of such products or fuel sources, may reduce demand for our offerings or impact the energy supply markets. 

Employees and Human Capital Resources

Attracting and retaining qualified personnel familiar with our businesses who head our different businesses units is critical to our success. As of March 4, 2022, we had 186 employees, 160 located in United States and 26 located in Finland.

 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. To accomplish that, our compensation practices are designed to attract and retain qualified and motivated personnel and align their interests with the goals of the Company and with the best interests of our stockholders. Our compensation philosophy is to provide compensation to attract the individuals necessary for our current needs and growth initiatives, and provide them with the proper incentives to motivate those individuals to achieve our long-term plans, which includes among other things, equity and cash incentive plans that attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards. 

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain name registrations and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand names. All of our employees sign confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that the employee may not use or disclose our confidential information except as expressly permitted in connection with the performance of his or her duties for us, or in other limited circumstances. These agreements also state that, to the extent rights in any invention conceived of by the employee while employed by us do not vest in us automatically by operation of law, the employee is required to assign his or her rights to us.
