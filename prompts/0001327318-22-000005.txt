Item 1.    Business
Overview
    TrueCar is a leading automotive digital marketplace that enables car buyers to connect to our network of Certified Dealers. We are building the industry’s most personalized and efficient car buying experience as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online.
    We have established a diverse software ecosystem on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. Our company-branded platform is available on our TrueCar website and mobile applications. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like PenFed and American Express; membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam’s Club and AAA; and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users during the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.
    We benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make, model and trim of car in their area and price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which we refer to as VIN-based offers, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. VIN-based offers provide consumers with price offers for specific vehicles from specific dealers and compare that price to the market average. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.
    Our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new car franchises, representing all major makes of cars, as well as independent dealers selling used vehicles. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
    Our subsidiary, TCDS, provides our Trade and Payments solutions as part of our Access and TrueCar+ offerings. Our Trade solution gives consumers information on the value of their trade-in vehicles and enables them to obtain a guaranteed trade-in price before setting foot in the dealership. This valuation is, in turn, backed by a third-party guarantee to dealers that the vehicles will be repurchased at the indicated price if the dealer does not want to keep them. Our Payments solution leverages the digital retailing technology that we acquired from DealerScience to help consumers calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking (which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options) and streamline the consumer’s experience from shopping to showroom.
Products and Services

Consumer
    Consumers interface with us through our TrueCar-branded website, affinity group marketing partner websites and TrueCar-branded and affinity group mobile applications.
    The following are key elements of our consumer experience:
    Research & Discovery. We provide information to consumers in the form of verified owner ratings and reviews, data-driven vehicle rankings, editorial content and in other formats that allow consumers to research, compare and discover the right vehicle based on their preferences.
    New Car Build Experience. We provide an experience where consumers can enter their zip code and select their preferred make, model, trim and options, and then, in most instances, immediately see actual nearby cars that are generally consistent with their preferences. Also, in most instances, we present consumers with a graphical distribution of what others in the local market paid for a similar make, model and trim of car. Within this distribution, we include MSRP and the Market Average, a proprietary calculation based on recent transactions, that provides an understanding of what others have paid for similarly configured vehicles. This information enables consumers to evaluate a potential price in the context of broader market data. When ready, consumers can proceed to register and connect with local Certified Dealers that can provide upfront, personalized price offers on in-stock inventory that is generally consistent with consumers’ build preferences. Consumers are provided the option to connect with one or more local dealers in order to get the right deal on the car they want and proceed with purchase. 
    Used Car Inventory Search. We provide an experience where consumers can access and search an extensive selection of pre-owned vehicles for sale by Certified Dealers across the United States. Nearly every used listing has a price rating we compute based 
on similar used car listings in consumers’ local area, so these consumers have market context. In addition, consumers can see vehicle information, photos and condition summaries, and choose to connect with a Certified Dealer to confirm availability, get an upfront offer and proceed with purchase.
    VIN Offers. In most instances, when consumers choose to connect with a Certified Dealer, they will receive price offers from the dealer on in-stock vehicles with specified Vehicle Identification Numbers, or VINs. Each offer provides a comprehensive savings summary including MSRP, incentives, dealer discounts, total MSRP and a price rating so that consumers can know if they are getting a price that makes sense for them in the context of their market.
    TrueCar Deal Builder. After consumers have identified a vehicle in which they are interested and received a price offer from a dealer subscribed to one of our Access packages discussed further below, we allow them to further customize their “deal” through our TrueCar Deal Builder, including their vehicle trade-in and payment. If consumers intend to trade in a vehicle in connection with their purchase, or sell their vehicle to a dealer, they can obtain a conditional price offer on the trade-in vehicle through our Trade solution. The Deal Builder also allows consumers to customize a loan or a lease and approximate monthly payments, inclusive of applicable incentives, taxes and fees and based on self-reported credit score, loan or lease term and other factors. Beyond receiving a trade-in offer and estimating their payment, consumers using our TrueCar Deal Builder functionality can learn about and indicate interest in commonly available service and protection plans, send questions to the dealer, schedule a test drive or schedule an appointment to finalize the deal for their vehicle of interest. We view the Deal Builder as an important component of our efforts to create a seamless end-to-end car-buying experience. 
Finance and Insurance Features. Since 2020, we have introduced three finance and insurance, or F&I, features to our websites to help streamline consumers’ car-buying experience. Our insurance feature allows consumers to connect with one of our insurance partners, from whom they may obtain car insurance. We also have partnered with a financial institution to allow consumers who have received offers from dealers who also have partnered with this institution to pre-qualify for a car loan. Finally, we enable consumers to use a widget that connects them with a major consumer credit reporting agency to allow them to request their credit score.
Dealer
    Our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers interfaces with our platform primarily through our Dealer Portal, an application that can be accessed online or using a mobile device. The Dealer Portal is considered a sales enhancement tool, and it enables dealers to access unique information on their prospects unavailable to them in their standard customer relationship management, or CRM, software. The Dealer Portal allows dealers to assess the competitiveness of their vehicle pricing relative to their market, create vehicle pricing rules, access details on potential buyers’ wants and needs, create custom detailed offers based on vehicles in stock, manage how their dealership profile appears on the network and assess their competitive market performance on vehicles sold through their dealership, among a number of other administrative and management tools. 

    Pricing Tools. The Pricing Manager tool available on our Dealer Portal provides dealers with a single interface to assess the competitiveness of their vehicle pricing relative to their market and set pricing on all makes and models they offer for sale. The Sales Analyzer tool helps dealers better understand how their pricing for recently sold vehicles compares to the market, whether or not the customer transaction was with one of our users.

    Sales Closing Tools. The Offer Tool helps dealers create custom detailed offers based on vehicles in stock. The Dealership Profile tool enables dealers to give customers information about their dealership, including salespersons’ names and pictures, dealership makes, hours of operation and website and social media links.
    TrueCar Access. We also offer dealers our subscription-based TrueCar Access package, comprised of our Trade and Payments solutions. Through our Trade solution, dealers participating in our Access package benefit from a third-party guarantee of the trade-in price given to our users by an affiliate of our partner Accu-Trade, allowing dealers to honor the trade-in price without assuming any risk to get an instant True Cash Offer on their trade-in vehicle. The Accu-Trade business is contractually obligated to continue to offer these services to us for a minimum of one year under a new commercial agreement following the completion of the pending acquisition of the Accu-Trade business by Cars.com Inc. And through our Payments solution, dealers can show consumers accurate estimates of their monthly lease or loan payments with digital retailing tools that span the buying and selling lifecycle. We have historically sold these products separately, and continue to do so to certain dealers with grandfathered subscriptions. Dealers can access these tools through the Dealer Portal referred to above.
Manufacturers

    We enable manufacturers to target consumers based on membership in an affinity group and other criteria. Through our platform, manufacturers can create cash incentives targeted to specific consumers and provide the ability to generate a unique coupon 
code that can be redeemed and validated at any dealership across the country in connection with the purchase of a vehicle. By facilitating and tracking these incentive codes in their own reporting systems, manufacturers can account directly for this method of reaching consumers. These manufacturers pay a subscription or per-vehicle fee to us for this service.
TrueCar+
    As of December 31, 2021, our TrueCar+ offering was available in the Tampa, Florida market. In the first quarter of 2022, we expanded this offering in select markets and expect to continue rolling it out in additional markets in the future. Where available, this product incorporates elements of an “end-to-end” car-buying experience for consumers, which we envision allowing them to complete all of the steps of purchasing a vehicle from participating TrueCar Certified Dealers, from researching vehicles, to trading in their current vehicles, to obtaining insurance and financing products, to accepting delivery and signing the necessary legal documents, all without leaving their homes.
Sales and Marketing

Consumer marketing

    We reach consumers through the TrueCar website and the branded mobile applications and websites we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. Our marketing is focused on building the TrueCar brand. The key tenets of our brand are providing transparent market price information and enhancing the car-buying experience for both consumers and dealers. We divide our marketing spend between traditional media sources, such as television and radio, and digital media. Our consumer brand awareness efforts are aided by the fact that we are quoted in various media outlets from time to time as a recognized industry authority on automotive retail and online data forecasting.
    We also support initiatives for our affinity group marketing partners, including Navy Federal Credit Union, U.S. News & World Report, Consumer Reports, AAA, American Express and PenFed. These initiatives are designed to promote awareness of the organizations’ car-buying programs among their memberships through a variety of media, including television, email, direct mail, website development, print, online advertising, Internet search engine marketing, Internet search engine optimization and social networking.

Dealer engagement and industry relations

    Our dealer solutions team is responsible for supporting our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, optimizing our TrueCar Certified Dealer coverage across brands and geographies and for providing onboarding and dealer support. Our team helps dealers grow their businesses by regularly providing data-driven insights on inventory management and pricing.

    Our ability to understand the needs of, actively listen to and collaborate with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers is crucial to our success, and many of our dealer solutions team employees have worked at dealerships or manufacturers. 

Competition

    The automotive retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Consumers use a variety of online and offline sources to research vehicle information, obtain vehicle pricing information and identify dealers. In addition, dealers use a variety of marketing channels to promote themselves to consumers.
Competition for consumer awareness

    We compete to attract consumers directly to our TrueCar.com website and mobile applications primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience; the breadth, depth and accuracy of information; brand awareness; and reputation.

    Our principal competitors for consumer awareness include:
•Internet search engines and online automotive sites such as Google, Amazon Vehicles, Autotrader.com, eBay Motors, AutoWeb.com (formerly Autobytel.com), KBB.com, CarSaver.com, CarGurus.com and Cars.com;
•sites operated by automobile manufacturers such as General Motors and Ford;
•online automobile retailers such as Carvana, Vroom, CarMax (and its subsidiary Edmunds) and Shift Technologies;
•providers of offline, membership-based car-buying services, such as the Costco Auto Program; and 
•offline automotive classified listings, such as trade periodicals and local newspapers.

Competition for car dealer marketing spend

    We compete for a share of car dealers’ overall marketing expenditures within online and offline media marketing channels. We compete primarily on the basis of the transaction-readiness of our users; the efficiency of customer acquisition as compared to alternative methods; the accountability and measurability of our service; product features, analytics and tools; dealer support; and the size of our prospective car buyer audience. Other businesses also derive a majority of their revenue by offering consumer marketing services to dealers. These companies include listings, information, lead generation and car-buying services, and compete with us for dealer marketing spend.

    Our principal competitors for car dealer marketing spend include:

•online automotive content publishers such as Edmunds and KBB.com selling impression-based display advertising, and online automotive classified listing sites such as Autotrader.com, CarGurus.com and Cars.com selling inventory-based subscription billing;
•lead generators such as AutoWeb.com selling pay-per-lead advertising;
•Internet sites such as Google and Facebook selling cost-per-click advertising; and
•offline media, including newspaper, outdoor advertising, radio, television and direct mail.
Technology
    We have designed our technology platform, website and products to provide consumers, dealers and other parties with the information they need to effect a successful car purchase. Consumers access this platform through the TrueCar-branded website, affinity group marketing partner websites and TrueCar-branded and affinity group mobile applications. Dealers access the platform through the software tools available on our Dealer Portal. Supporting each of these user interfaces are advanced systems for processing and analyzing automotive data, including features such as vehicle configurators and predictive consumer behavior modeling, as well as our proprietary matching algorithm to compare our transaction-based data sources with our record of online users for processing and billing. We use a combination of open source and licensed software running on optimized hardware.

    Substantially all of our data processing and storage capabilities are cloud-based and sufficiently redundant. We have adopted a centralized approach to quality assurance and testing for our technology platform and all products aimed at enhancing consumer and dealer experiences while seeking to optimize availability, scalability, security and performance.

Intellectual Property

    We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions.

    At December 31, 2021, we had 64 U.S. issued patents, 22 pending U.S. patent applications, 8 issued foreign patents and 2 pending foreign patent applications. The issued and allowed patents begin expiring in 2029 through 2038. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position.
    We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We registered “TrueCar,” “TrueCar+,” the TrueCar logo, various TRUE marks and other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions. We also have filed trademark applications for other entities in the United States and other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position.

    In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our website.
Seasonality
    Across the automotive industry, consumers tend to purchase a higher volume of cars in the second and third quarters of each year, due in part to the introduction of new vehicle models from manufacturers. As our business is substantially dependent on the volume of car purchases in the United States, this seasonal trend affects our business.
Regulatory Matters
    Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. In particular, the advertising and sale of new or used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states in which we do business. Although we do not sell motor vehicles, the dealers from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues do sell motor vehicles. These regulations limit the business that we can conduct, the offerings we provide and the manner in which we can compete in the market. Moreover, state regulatory authorities or other third parties could take and, on some occasions, have taken the position that some of the regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. Additionally, as discussed in greater detail under “Risk Factors” herein, we have from time to time been required to devote material resources to defend ourselves from allegations of violations. 

In order to operate in this highly-regulated environment, we have developed our products and services with a view toward appropriately managing the risk that our regulatory compliance or the regulatory compliance of the dealers in our dealer network could be challenged. If, and to the extent that, our products and services fail to satisfy relevant regulatory requirements, our business or our TrueCar Certified Dealers could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation, as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states.
     Given the regulatory environment in which we and our participating dealers operate, in designing our products and services, we have focused considerable attention on two areas of state regulation: state advertising regulations and state brokering or “bird-dogging” regulations. With respect to advertising, we believe that most of the content displayed on the websites we operate does not constitute advertising for the sale of new motor vehicles. Nevertheless, we endeavor to design the content such that it would comply insofar as practicable with state advertising regulations if and to the extent that the content is considered to be new vehicle sales advertising. With respect to state brokering or “bird-dogging” regulations, we have designed our products and services in a manner that aims to avoid the applicability of those regulations.
Additionally, the advertising and sale of automobile insurance and the provision of automobile financing products are highly regulated by the jurisdictions in which we do business. Although we do not sell insurance or automobiles or provide automobile financing products or render credit decisions, certain of our partners sell insurance or provide automobile financing products to the public in general, and may sell insurance or provide automobile financing products to our users in particular. Further, we enter into arrangements with certain such partners from time to time pursuant to which we receive fees based in whole or in part on the volume of our users who choose to interact with those partners. We cannot guarantee you that regulatory authorities or third parties will not take the position that some of the regulations applicable to insurance brokers or automobile financing providers, or to the manner in which insurance products or automobile financing products are advertised or sold, apply to our platforms or business.
The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to those allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenues, increased expenses and decreased profitability.
The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we obtain from dealers is competitively sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be used by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our dealer network.
In addition, governmental or private civil actions under the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose dealer pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our TrueCar Certified Dealers in class action or other civil litigation.
We are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations that relate to privacy, data protection and personal information, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current practices and policies. For example, legislative or regulatory actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users, use or share information or obtain consent to use or share information could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.
The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. Our efforts to design products and services in a manner that appropriately manages the regulatory compliance risk for our business and our participating dealers are complicated by the fact that many of the laws and regulations referred to above vary from state to state, and even within a given state are frequently susceptible to multiple interpretations. Further, the automotive regulatory laws were generally developed decades before the emergence of the Internet, they are subject to significant revision or modification and the manner in which they should be applied to our business model is frequently open to question. As a practical matter, state automobile dealer associations often have considerable influence over the construction of these laws by the relevant state regulatory authorities. Accordingly, in addition to our dialogues with relevant state agencies, we interface on a regular basis with representatives from automobile dealer associations in order to take their views into account as we continually update our products and services. The specific manner in which we have designed our products and services in an effort to manage regulatory compliance concerns for us and our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers is the result of extensive analysis, which has required the investment of substantial resources that we believe represents a valuable asset of our business. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully comply with current or future regulations to which our business may be subject.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, we had 428 full-time employees nationwide. Before we implemented a mandatory work-from-home policy in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a majority of our employees were based in our Santa Monica, California headquarters, with additional employees based in our Austin, Texas office and in the field throughout the United States, and a relatively small presence in our Boston, Massachusetts office. We have since terminated the lease for our Boston office and determined to adopt a dynamic workforce paradigm, the details of which have not yet been finalized, but pursuant to which we expect a substantial number of our employees to work primarily from home even after pandemic conditions abate. We also engage a number of temporary employees and consultants to support our operations. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, and our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, including our dealer, marketing, engineering, finance, accounting, legal and other personnel. Competition for qualified employees in our industry, particularly for software engineers, data scientists and other technical staff, is intense, and we face significant competition in hiring and retaining them. To attract and retain executives and other key employees in this competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive compensation packages, including cash and stock-based compensation. Our primary forms of stock-based incentive awards are stock options and restricted stock units.
We view our people as our most important capital asset, in which we strive to invest to develop talent and growth to build their capabilities. We leverage both extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. Base pay for all of our positions is benchmarked to relevant external peer and role comparators and determined based on level expectations and proficiency evaluations within the applicable level. Equity awards for new hires are based on the employee’s position, prior experience, qualifications and the market for particular types of talent. Additional equity grants are based on employee contribution, potential and retention objectives. Equity awards generally have long-term (four year) vesting periods to reinforce the employee’s focus on our long-term success. Non-executive employee cash bonuses are based on company financial and individual performance. The executive cash bonus program is based on company financial performance and the attainment of key strategic objectives under the annual plan approved by the Compensation and Workforce Committee of our Board of Directors. After the end of the fiscal year, the Committee reviews performance against plan objectives and determines the actual payout of the bonus. Members of our dealer organization are eligible for incentive compensation in lieu of the corporate bonus program, which is based on attainment of key activities or the completion of key objectives deemed important by department and company leadership for the growth and maintenance of our dealer network. We also consider the health insurance and other benefits that we provide to be an important part of our overall compensation package.
Finally, as part of our continuing efforts to support our employees and be responsive to their concerns, we regularly measure and monitor employee morale and engagement and assess our culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion. Particularly in the wake of the disruptions occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, we have found this dialogue to be valuable.
