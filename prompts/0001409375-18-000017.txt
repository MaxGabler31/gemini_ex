ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

As used herein, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Orion,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and similar references are to Orion Energy Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We provide enterprise-grade LED lighting and energy project solutions. We research, develop, design, manufacture, market, sell and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient commercial and industrial interior and exterior lighting systems and related services. Our products are targeted for applications in three primary market segments: commercial office and retail, area lighting and industrial applications, although we do sell and install products into other markets. Virtually all of our sales occur within North America. 
Our lighting products consist primarily of light emitting diode ("LED") lighting fixtures. Our principal customers include national account end-users, electrical distributors, energy service companies ("ESCOs") and electrical contractors. Currently, substantially all of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED market continues to evolve, we are increasingly sourcing products and components from third parties in order to provide versatility in our product development.
We believe the market for lighting products has shifted to LED lighting systems, and that the customer base for our legacy high intensity fluorescent ("HIF") technology products will continue to decline. Compared to our legacy lighting systems, we believe that LED lighting technology allows for better optical performance, significantly reduced maintenance costs due to performance longevity and reduced energy consumption. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by fluorescent or other legacy technologies. Our LED lighting technologies have become the primary component of our revenue as we continue to strive to be a leader in the LED market. Although we continue to sell some lighting products using our legacy HIF technology, we do not build to stock HIF products and instead build to committed customer orders as received. We plan to maintain our primary focus on developing and selling innovative LED products.
We do not have long-term contracts with our customers that provide us with recurring revenue from period to period and we typically generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of lighting systems and related services to governmental, commercial and industrial customers on a project-by-project basis. We typically sell our lighting systems in replacement of our customers’ existing fixtures. We call this replacement process a “retrofit". We frequently engage our customer’s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services. We also sell our lighting systems on a wholesale basis, principally to electrical contractors, electrical distributors, and ESCOs to sell to their own customer bases.
Our ability to achieve our desired revenue growth and profitability goals depends on our ability to effectively engage distribution and sales agents, develop recurring revenue streams, implement our cost reduction initiatives, and improve our marketing, new product development, project execution, customer service, margin enhancement and operating expense management, as well as other factors. In addition, the gross margins of our products can vary significantly depending upon the types of products we sell, with margins ranging from 15% to 50%. As a result, a change in the total mix of our sales among higher or lower margin products can cause our profitability to fluctuate from period to period. 
Our executive leadership team has developed a fiscal year 2019 Strategic Plan to reflect our current business environment and the continuing opportunities and challenges of the LED and connected lighting marketplace. The overall goal of the plan is to grow, become more profitable and increase shareholder value, considering this environment as well as our current financial situation. 
Management Restructuring and Focus on Profitability
In early fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors restructured our management team. As part of this restructuring, our Chief Executive Officer, John Scribante, left our Company and Mike Altschaefl, our then-current Board Chair, assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Scott Green, our then-current Executive Vice President, became our new Chief Operating Officer, with ongoing primary responsibility for improving our revenue generation. Mike Potts and Marc Meade, our then-current Executive Vice Presidents, remained in their positions and were assigned primary responsibility for substantially reducing our cost structure and for streamlining operations. Bill Hull remained in his position as Chief Financial Officer.
On August 30, 2017, Mike Potts retired as our Chief Risk Officer and Executive Vice President and continues to serve as a member of our Board of Directors and provides consulting services to us on an as needed basis.
Our market and product strategies have not changed. We have renewed our focus on sales channel execution, including a reduction in our cost structure. Our management team continues to implement its plan to achieve breakeven earnings (excluding 
4

employee separation costs) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, through the implementation of the following cost reduction measures:

• | Constant monitoring and management of manufacturing overhead costs to ensure we continue to deliver strong gross margins amid an increasingly competitive market landscape;


• | Reduction of staff positions through a targeted reduction in existing headcount and judicious replacement of staff either retiring or resigning;


• | Reduced total compensation for our executive management and board of directors;


• | Reductions in operating expenses, including better control of legal spending, elimination of our racing program and removal of various non-critical back office programs and initiatives.

We believe that the cost reduction plan actions taken during fiscal 2018 resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $6.0 million, which we expect to fully realize beginning in fiscal 2019. These cost reductions, coupled with our renewed focus on sales channel execution, will help to drive revenue growth and accelerate our path to profitability. 
Reportable Segments
Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is our chief executive officer. We have three reportable segments: Orion U.S. Markets Division ("USM"), Orion Engineered Systems Division ("OES"), and Orion Distribution Services Division ("ODS").
For financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note 17, "Segment Data" in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report.
Orion U.S. Markets Division
The USM segment sells commercial lighting systems and energy management systems to the wholesale contractor markets. USM customers include ESCOs and electrical contractors. During fiscal 2017 and 2018, a significant portion of the historic sales of this division migrated to distribution channel sales as a result of the implementation of our agent distribution strategy. The migrated sales are included in our ODS Division. 
Orion Engineered Systems Division
The OES segment develops and sells lighting products and provides construction and engineering services for our commercial lighting and energy management systems. OES provides turnkey solutions for large national accounts, governments, municipalities and schools.
Orion Distribution Services Division 
 The ODS segment focuses on selling lighting products through manufacturer representative agencies and a network of broadline North American distributors. This segment expanded in fiscal 2017 and 2018 as a result of increased sales through distributors as we continue to develop our agent driven distribution strategy. This expansion includes the migration of customers from direct sales previously included in the USM division.
Our Market Opportunity
We provide enterprise-grade LED lighting and energy project solutions. We are primarily focused on providing commercial and industrial facilities lighting retrofit solutions in North America using solid-state LED technology. Although we continue to sell some lighting products using our legacy HIF technology, we believe the market for lighting products has shifted to LED lighting systems, and thus the customer base for our legacy HIF products will continue to decline. Compared to our legacy lighting systems, LED lighting technology allows for better optical performance, significantly reduced maintenance costs due to performance longevity and reduced energy consumption. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by fluorescent or other legacy technologies.
Our products deliver energy savings and efficiency gains to our commercial and industrial customers without compromising their quantity or quality of light. We estimate that our energy management systems reduce our customers’ legacy lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater, while increasing their quantity of light by approximately 50% to 80% and improving overall lighting quality when replacing traditional fixtures. Our customers with legacy lighting systems typically realize a one to four-year payback period from electricity cost savings generated by our lighting systems without considering utility incentives or government subsidies. We have sold and installed our lighting products in over 14,500 facilities across North America, representing approximately 2.2 billion square feet of commercial and industrial building space, including sales to 191 of the Fortune 500 companies.

Energy-efficient lighting systems are cost-effective and environmentally responsible solutions allowing end users to reduce operating expenses. Based on a July 2015 report published by the United States Department of Energy, or DOE, we estimate the potential North American LED retrofit market within our primary markets to be approximately 1.1 billion lighting fixtures. Our primary markets are: commercial office and retail, area lighting and industrial applications. 
Commercial office and retail. Our commercial office and retail market includes commercial office buildings, retail store fronts, government offices, schools, hospitals and other buildings with traditional 10 to 12 foot ceiling heights. The DOE estimates that there are approximately 987 million office "troffer" fixtures within the United States, which is a rectangular light fixture that fits into a modular dropped ceiling grid. We believe we have the opportunity to increase our revenue by serving this market with our LED Door Retrofit, or LDRTM, lighting solutions.
Area lighting. Our market for area lighting includes parking garages, surface lots, automobile dealerships and gas service stations. The DOE estimates that there are approximately 66 million area lighting fixtures within the United States and an additional 45 million roadway lighting fixtures in the United States. 
Industrial applications. Our market for industrial facilities includes manufacturing facilities, distribution and warehouse facilities, government buildings and agricultural buildings. These facilities typically contain "high-bay" lighting fixtures. The DOE estimates that there are approximately 139 million low/high bay fixtures within the United States. We estimate that approximately 50% of this market still utilizes inefficient high intensity discharge ("HID") lighting technologies. 
Commercial and industrial facilities in the United States employ a variety of lighting technologies, including HID, traditional fluorescents, LED and incandescent lighting fixtures. Our lighting systems typically replace less efficient HID and HIF fixtures. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI, HID fixtures only convert approximately 36% of the energy they consume into visible light. We estimate our lighting systems generally reduce lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater compared to HID fixtures, while increasing the quantity of light by approximately 50% to 80% and improving overall lighting quality. 
We believe that utilities within the United States recognize the importance of energy efficiency as an economical means to manage capacity constraints and as a low-cost alternative when compared to the construction costs of building new power plants. Accordingly, many of these utilities are continually focused on demand reduction through energy efficiency. According to our research of individual state and utility programs, 50 states, through legislation, regulation or voluntary action, have seen their utilities design and fund programs that promote or deliver energy efficiency. Our products are not solely dependent upon these incentive programs, but we do believe that these incentive programs provide an important benefit as our customers evaluate their out-of-pocket cash investments.
Our Solution
50/50 Value Proposition. We estimate our LED lighting systems generally reduce lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater, compared to legacy fixtures, while increasing the quantity of light by approximately 50% to 80% and improving overall lighting quality. In the commercial office and retail markets, we estimate our lighting systems generally reduce electricity costs by 50% or greater compared to legacy fixtures. From December 1, 2001 through March 31, 2018, we believe that the use of LED and HIF fixtures has saved our customers $4.2 billion in electricity costs and reduced their energy consumption by 54.6 billion kWh.
Multi-Facility Roll-Out Capability. We offer our customers a single source, turnkey solution for project implementation in which we manage and maintain responsibility for entire multi-facility roll-outs of our energy management solutions across North American commercial and industrial facility portfolios. This capability allows us to offer our customers an orderly, timely and scheduled process for recognizing energy reductions and cost savings. 
Rapid Payback Period. In most retrofit projects where we replace HID and HIF fixtures, our customers typically realize a one to four year payback period on our lighting systems. These returns are achieved without considering utility incentives or government subsidies (although subsidies and incentives are continually being made available to our customers and us in connection with the installation of our systems that further shorten payback periods).
Easy Installation, Implementation and Maintenance. Most of our fixtures are designed with a lightweight construction and modular plug-and-play architecture that allows for fast and easy installation and facilitates maintenance, which allows for easy integration of other components of our energy management system. Our office LED Troffer Door Retrofit ("LDRTM") products are designed to allow for a fast and easy installation without disrupting the ceiling space or the office workspace. We believe our system’s design reduces installation time and expense compared to other lighting solutions, which further improves our customers’ return on investment. We also believe that our use of standard components reduces our customers’ ongoing maintenance costs.
Expanded Product Offerings. We are committed to continue developing LED product offerings in all of the markets we serve. Our third generation of ISON® class of LED interior fixture delivers a market leading 214 lumens per watt. This advancement means our customers can get more light with less energy, and sometimes fewer fixtures, than with any other product on the market.

In fiscal 2017 and 2018, we launched a variety of new products, features and functionality targeting healthcare, food service, high and low temperature environments and other market segments. See "Products and Services" below.
Environmental Benefits. By allowing for the permanent reduction of electricity consumption, our energy management systems reduce indirect CO2 emissions that are a negative by-product of energy generation. We estimate that one of our LED lighting systems, when replacing a standard HID fixture, displaces 0.352 kW of electricity, which, based on information provided by the EPA, reduces a customer’s indirect CO2 emissions by approximately 1.5 tons per year. Based on these figures, we estimate that the use of our products has reduced indirect CO2 emissions by approximately 34.1 million tons through March 31, 2018.
Our Competitive Strengths
Compelling Value Proposition. By permanently reducing lighting-related electricity usage, our systems enable our customers to achieve significant cost savings, without compromising the quantity or quality of light in their facilities. As a result, our products offer our customers a rapid return on their investment, without relying on government subsidies or utility incentives. We also offer our customers a single source solution whereby we manage and are responsible for the entire project, including installation across their entire North American real estate portfolio. Our ability to offer such a turnkey, national solution allows us to deliver energy reductions and cost savings to our customers in timely, orderly and planned multi-facility roll-outs.
Large and Growing Customer Base. We have developed a large and growing national customer base, and have installed our products in more than 14,500 commercial and industrial facilities across North America. We believe that the willingness of our blue-chip customers to install our products across multiple facilities represents a significant endorsement of our value proposition, which in turn helps us sell our energy management systems to new customers. We intend to leverage our expertise in managing projects across multiple facilities within our new LED product markets, which now include new customer opportunities with banks, insurance companies, hospitals, fast food chains, retail storefronts, grocery and pharmacies. 
Innovative Technology. We have developed a portfolio of 80 United States patents primarily covering various elements of our products. We believe these innovations allow our products to produce more light output per unit of input energy compared to our competition. We also have 21 patents pending that primarily cover various elements of our newly developed LED products and certain business methods. To complement our innovative energy management products, we have introduced integrated energy management services to provide our customers with a turnkey solution either at a single facility or across their North American facility footprints. Our demonstrated ability to innovate provides us with significant competitive advantages. Our lighting products offer significantly more light output as measured in foot-candles of light delivered per watt of electricity consumed when compared to HID or traditional fluorescent fixtures. Beyond the benefits of our lighting fixtures, we believe that there is also an opportunity to utilize our system platform as a “digital” or “connected ceiling”, or a framework or network that can support the installation and integration of other business solutions on our digital platform. This anticipated potential growth opportunity is also known as the “Industrial Internet of Things” or IoT, and is still early in its development; however, we have already participated in a few compelling applications that deliver cost savings and efficiency in areas outside of lighting.
Expanded Sales and Distribution Network. In addition to selling directly to electrical distribution customers, we sell our lighting products and services to national accounts. We now have relationships with more than 200 resellers and distributors that are represented by a North American network of independent lighting agencies. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we had approximately 50 different lighting agencies representing us in substantially all of North America. We intend to continue to selectively build our sales network in the future, with a focus on geographic regions where we do not currently have a strong sales presence.
Our Growth Strategies
Expanded Sales Network and Salesforce. We believe that partnering with an agency sales force focused on providing technical product and sales support to our customers provides us with a greater potential for revenue growth. We sell our products in one of three ways: (i) directly with our relationships with our national account partners; (ii) indirectly through independent sales agencies and broadline North American distributors; and (iii) through wholesale contractors, including ESCOs and electrical contractors. During fiscal 2016, we engaged more than 18 manufacturer representative agencies to expand our reach with the broadline distributors and further enhance our ability to grow revenue. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, we engaged approximately 50 manufacturer representative agencies, covering substantially all of North America. At the end of fiscal 2018, we now have relationships with more than 200 resellers and distributors that are represented by a North American network of independent lighting agencies. We continue to expand our sales network and we are also maintaining our in-market sales force which generates revenue through our independent channels. 
Leverage Existing Customer Base. Over the last several years, we have focused on expanding our relationships with our existing customers by transitioning from single-site facility implementations to comprehensive enterprise-wide rollouts of our lighting products. We also intend to leverage our large installed base of HIF lighting systems to implement all aspects of our energy management system, particularly LED lighting products, wireless controls, cloud-based power data analysis and storage capabilities for our existing customers.

Continue to Improve Operational Efficiencies. We are focused on continually improving the efficiency of our operations to increase the profitability of our business and allow us to continue to deliver our compelling value proposition.
Create a Culture to Support Growth. We are focused on establishing a corporate culture that embraces high expectations and performance to continue to drive innovation, efficiency and deliver superior results to our customers. 
Products and Services
Our primary focus has been, and will continue to be, emphasizing our LED lighting fixtures. Currently, substantially all of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility location in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED market continues to evolve, we also source products and components from third parties in order to have versatility in our product development. We are focused on researching, developing and/or acquiring new innovative LED products and technologies for the retrofit markets, such as the LDRTM. We plan to focus our efforts on developing creative new LED retrofit products in order to offer our customers a variety of integrated energy management services, such as system design, project management and installation.
Products
The following is a description of our primary products:
The LED Troffer Door Retrofit (LDRTM): The LDRTM is designed to replace existing 4 foot by 2 foot and 2 foot by 2 foot fluorescent troffers that are frequently found in office or retail grid ceilings. Our LDRTM product is unique in that the LED optics and electronics are housed within the doorframe that allows for installation of the product in approximately one to two minutes. Our LDRTM product also provides reduced maintenance expenses based upon improved LED chips.
Interior LED High Bay Fixtures: Our LED interior high bay lighting products consist of our Harris high bay, ApolloTM high bay and ISON® high bay products. Our ISON® class of LED interior fixture offers a full package of premium features, including low total cost of ownership, optics that currently exceed competitors in terms of lumen package, delivered light, modularity and advanced thermal management. Our third generation of ISON® class of LED interior fixture delivers up to an exceptional 214 lumens per watt. This advancement means our customers can get more light with less energy, and sometimes fewer fixtures, compared to other products on the market. Our ApolloTM class of LED interior fixtures is designed for new construction and retrofit projects where initial cost is the largest factor in the purchase decision. Our Harris high bay is ideal for customers seeking a cost-effective solution to deliver energy savings and maintenance reductions. In addition, our LED interior lighting products are lightweight and easy to handle, which further reduces installation and maintenance costs and helps to build brand loyalty with electrical contractors and installers.
Smart Lighting Controls. We offer a broad array of smart building control systems that have either been developed by us under the InteLiteTM brand, or procured from third parties. These control systems provide both lighting control options (such as occupancy, daylight, or schedule control) and data intelligence capabilities for building managers to log, monitor, and analyze use of space, energy savings, and provide physical security of the space.
Other Products. We also offer our customers a variety of other LED, HIF, and induction fixtures to address their lighting and energy management needs, including fixtures designed for agribusinesses, parking lots, roadways, retail, mezzanine, outdoor applications and private label resale.
Warranty Policy. Our warranty policy generally provides for a limited one-year warranty on our HIF products and a limited five-year warranty on our LED products, although we do offer warranties ranging up to 10 years for certain LED products. Ballasts, lamps, drivers, LED chips and other electrical components are excluded from our standard warranty as they are covered by separate warranties offered by the original equipment manufacturers. We coordinate and process customer warranty inquiries and claims, including inquiries and claims relating to ballast and lamp components, through our customer service department.
Services
We provide a range of fee-based lighting-related energy management services to our customers, including:

• | comprehensive site assessment, which includes a review of the current lighting requirements and energy usage at the customer’s facility;


• | site field verification, or SFV, during which we perform a test implementation of our energy management system at a customer’s facility;


• | utility incentive and government subsidy management, where we assist our customers in identifying, applying for and obtaining available utility incentives or government subsidies;


• | engineering design, which involves designing a customized system to suit our customers' facility lighting and energy management needs, and providing the customer with a written analysis of the potential energy savings and lighting and environmental benefits associated with the designed system;

8


• | project management, which involves us working with the electrical contractor in overseeing and managing all phases of implementation from delivery through installation for a single facility or through multi-facility roll-outs tied to a defined project schedule;


• | installation services, for our products, which we provide through our national network of qualified third-party installers; and


• | recycling in connection with our retrofit installations, where we remove, dispose of and recycle our customer’s legacy lighting fixtures.

We also provide other services that comprise a small amount of our revenue. These services primarily include management and control of power quality and remote monitoring and control of our installed systems. We also sell and distribute replacement lamps and fixture components into the after-market.
Our Customers
We primarily target commercial, institutional and industrial customers who have warehousing, manufacturing, and office facilities. In fiscal 2018, two customers accounted for 11.7% and 10.8% of total revenue. In fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, there was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 
Sales and Marketing 
We believe that partnering with an agency sales force focused on providing technical product and sales support to our customers provides us with a greater potential for revenue growth. We sell our products in one of three ways: (i) directly with our relationships with our national account partners; (ii) indirectly through independent sales agencies and broadline North American distributors; and (iii) through wholesale contractors, including ESCOs and electrical contractors. Our ODS segment focuses on developing and expanding customer relationships with independent manufacturer’s agents and broadline distributors. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, we engaged approximately 50 manufacturer representative agencies to expand our reach with broadline distributors and further enhance our ability to increase our revenue. We attempt to leverage the customer relationships of these distributors to further extend the geographic scope of our selling efforts. We work cooperatively with our indirect channels through participation in national trade organizations and by providing training on our sales methodologies. We intend to continue to selectively expand our independent sales agent network, focusing on those geographic regions where we lack sufficient sales coverage.
We have historically focused our marketing efforts on traditional direct advertising, as well as developing brand awareness through customer education and active participation in trade shows and energy management seminars. These efforts have included participating in national, regional and local trade organizations, exhibiting at trade shows, executing targeted direct mail campaigns, advertising in select publications, public relations campaigns, social media and other lead generation and brand-building initiatives.
Competition
The market for energy-efficient lighting products and services is fragmented. We face strong competition primarily from manufacturers and distributors of lighting products and services as well as electrical contractors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, cost, performance, quality, customer experience, energy efficiency, customer service and marketing support.
There are a number of lighting fixture manufacturers that sell LED and HIF products that compete with our lighting product lines. Lighting companies such as Acuity Brands, Inc., Carmanah Technology Corporation, Energy Focus, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, Cree, Inc., LSI Industries, Inc., Revolution Lighting Technologies Inc., TCP International Holdings, Inc., and Hubbell Incorporated are some of our main competitors within the commercial office, retail and industrial markets. We are also facing increased competition from manufacturers in low-cost countries.
We also face competition from companies who provide energy management services. Some of these competitors, such as Ameresco, Inc., Johnson Controls, Inc. and Honeywell International, provide basic systems and controls designed to further energy efficiency. 
Intellectual Property
As of March 31, 2018, we had been issued 80 United States patents and have applied for 21 additional United States patents. The patented and patent pending technologies cover various innovative elements of our products, including our HIF and LED fixtures. Our patented LDRTM product allows for a significantly quicker installation when compared to competitor's commercial office lighting products. Our smart lighting controls allow our lighting fixtures to selectively provide a targeted amount of light where and when it is needed most. 
We believe that our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business. We also believe that our patents covering our ability to manage the thermal and optical performance of our LED and HIF lighting products are material to our business, and that the loss of these patents could significantly and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.

Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize in the future as a result of firm, committed orders. Our backlog as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 totaled $3.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively.  We generally expect our backlog to be recognized as revenue within one year. 
Manufacturing and Distribution
We lease approximately 197,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where substantially all of our products are manufactured. 
We generally maintain a significant supply of raw material and purchased and manufactured component inventory. We contract with transportation companies to ship our products and manage all aspects of distribution logistics. We generally ship our products directly to the end user.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are centered on developing new LED products and technologies and enhancing existing products. The products, technologies and services we are developing are focused on increasing end user energy efficiency and enhancing lighting output. Over the last three fiscal years, we have focused our development on additional LED products, resulting in our development and commercialization of several new suites of LED interior high bay products. 
Our research and development expenditures were $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
We operate research and development lab and test facilities in our Jacksonville, Florida and Manitowoc, Wisconsin locations.
Regulatory Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water, the remediation of contaminated properties and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of, and exposure to, waste and other materials, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We believe that our business, operations, and facilities are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
State, county or municipal statutes often require that a licensed electrician be present and supervise each retrofit project. Further, all installations of electrical fixtures are subject to compliance with electrical codes in virtually all jurisdictions in the United States. In cases where we engage independent contractors to perform our retrofit projects, we believe that compliance with these laws and regulations is the responsibility of the applicable contractor.
