Company History 

Veru is a Wisconsin corporation that is the successor to The Wisconsin Pharmacal Company, Inc. (Wisconsin Pharmacal), a company which manufactured and marketed disparate specialty chemical and branded consumer products. Wisconsin Pharmacal was originally incorporated in 1971. In 1996, we completed a series of actions which resulted in our acquisition of worldwide rights to our first-generation female condom, the divestiture of Wisconsin Pharmacal’s other businesses and the change of our name to “The Female Health Company.” On October 31, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “APP Acquisition”), which transitioned us from a single product company selling FC2 to a biopharmaceutical company with a robust drug development program. On July 31, 2017, we changed our corporate name from “The Female Health Company” to “Veru Inc.” reflecting our focus on developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products.
Our Strategy 

Our strategy focuses primarily on the clinical development and commercialization of novel medicines for COVID-19 and other viral ARDS-related diseases and novel oncology medicines, initially for the management of two of the most prevalent cancers globally – breast cancer and prostate cancer. In addition, we seek to operate and grow our sexual health program to help fund our oncology and other clinical development efforts. The key elements of our strategy are: 




Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for COVID-19 and other viral ARDS-related diseases.

We discovered that sabizabulin, an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity, microtubule disruptor, which is being developed for cancer indications, also has both broad antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that based on this mechanism of drug action, sabizabulin may serve as a two-pronged approach to the treatment of COVID-19 viral infection, and the subsequent debilitating inflammatory effects that can lead to ARDS and death. The Company has completed positive Phase 2 and positive Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating sabizabulin in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The Phase 3 clinical study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial that was conducted in 204 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of deaths by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously halted the study for clear clinical efficacy and identified no safety concerns. Treatment with sabizabulin 9 mg once daily resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 55.2% relative reduction in deaths compared to placebo receiving standard of care treatment. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization for sabizabulin in adult hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death.

On November 9, 2022, the FDA’s Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) met to review sabizabulin for the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS. The advisory committee voted 8-5 that the known and potential benefits of sabizabulin when used for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of ARDS do not outweigh the known and potential risks of sabizabulin. However, there was additional discussion around the clinical trial design aspects of a potential confirmatory Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial as a post emergency use authorization requirement. The FDA considers the input of the advisory committee as part of their review of the EUA, but the advisory committee decision is not binding and the FDA makes the final decision on the request for an EUA.

The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) informed the Company on July 25, 2022, that the sabizabulin marketing authorization application will receive expedited review. On July 27, 2022, The European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Emergency Task Force initiated the review of sabizabulin treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients for emergency use in European Union (EU) countries under Article 18. On August 22, 2022, Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) determined that sabizabulin treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS qualifies for an expedited, provisional registration regulatory pathway. 

We want to focus the clinical development of sabizabulin, a broad spectrum antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, as a treatment for additional indications including influenza-related ARDS and other viral-associated ARDS.

Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for advanced breast cancer. 

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women with an estimated 290,560 new cases and 43,780 deaths expected for 2022 in the U.S. It is expected that one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Estrogen is one of the main drivers of breast cancer proliferation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Consequently, treatments that target the estrogen receptor (ER) have been the mainstay of breast cancer therapy, but unfortunately almost all women will eventually develop resistance to endocrine therapies and alternative treatment approaches will be required including IV chemotherapy. 



Our breast cancer pipeline includes enobosarm and sabizabulin. Enobosarm is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity, selective androgen receptor agonist that targets the AR in AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer without unwanted masculinizing side effects. Enobosarm is the first new class of targeted endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer in decades. Enobosarm has extensive nonclinical and clinical experience having been evaluated in 25 separate clinical studies in over 2,100 subjects, including five prior Phase 2 clinical studies in advanced breast cancer involving more than 250 patients. In the two Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in women with AR+ ER+ HER2- breast cancer, enobosarm demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy in heavily pretreated patients and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. 

Sabizabulin is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity that uniquely targets and crosslinks microtubules which are critical components of the cytoskeleton and a well-validated target for anticancer drugs. Sabizabulin has been evaluated initially in Phase 1b/2 clinical studies in 80 patients with advanced prostate cancer. Sabizabulin was well-tolerated and had promising evidence of antitumor activity. Sabizabulin could be evaluated in advanced breast cancer.

We have developed an extensive breast cancer program with a new focus on late-stage clinical study to evaluate enobosarm in combination with abemaciclib or sabizabulin in metastatic breast cancer. Global revenues for current oral therapies for advanced breast cancer are over $14 billion. 

Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for prostate cancer management. 

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men with an estimated 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths expected for 2022 in the U.S. It is expected that one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime. Prostate cancer has become a chronic disease with new challenges as prostate cancer develops resistance to current drugs and spreads throughout the body and as the patient suffers from the long-term side effects of these cancer treatments like hot flashes, bone loss and fractures, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and loss of muscle strength and frailty. 

Our prostate cancer pipeline includes sabizabulin, an oral novel microtubule disruptor, VERU-100, a long-acting GnRH antagonist depot, and zuclomiphene citrate, nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist – each of which seeks to address unmet medical needs in potentially large markets relating to advanced prostate cancer. 

Grow our sexual health program to invest proceeds in the clinical development of our drug pipeline with the goal of accessing large premium markets in COVID-19 and other viral ARDS-related diseases and in oncology. 

oENTADFI™ (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg capsule) is an FDA-approved combination of finasteride, a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, and tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor indicated for the initial treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms from an enlarged prostate. ENTADFI is now commercially available nationwide and may also be marketed and distributed through telemedicine (telemedicine being the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology) partnership channels in the U.S. 

oWe are working toward the goal of returning to revenue growth from FC2 in the U.S. market through prescription sales via our established dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal, while leveraging our relationships with telemedicine and pharmacy internet providers and distributors. We are also seeking to grow revenues in the public health sector in key U.S. and global markets via partnerships/distribution agreements with regional distributors/players. 

Capitalize on expertise and reputation of our management team and board members. Our management team has significant expertise and experience in urology, oncology, and infectious diseases as well as drug development, regulatory matters, marketing and sales, and business development which we believe facilitates effective management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials of drug candidates, potential launch planning, effective collaboration activity and product commercialization. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the strong reputations of the members of our management and board of directors with academic institutions, hospitals, physicians, pharmacists and distributors to expand our customer base and to introduce potential new products.

Our Clinical Trials Program and Our Drug Candidates

Infectious Disease Program

Sabizabulin 9mg for the treatment of hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS

Scientific Overview. Sabizabulin targets microtubules to provide a two-pronged approach against COVID-19 infection: first, as an antiviral, it would have direct effects on viral microtubule trafficking with the potential to reduce the production and release of infectious viruses, and second, as an anti-inflammatory agent, it may reduce virally-induced cytokine storm and severe inflammation leading to ARDS, septic shock, and death.



The Company has completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial, which was conducted in 204 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of deaths by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously halted the study for clear clinical efficacy benefit and no safety concerns were identified. Treatment with sabizabulin 9mg once daily resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 55.2% relative reduction in deaths compared to placebo receiving standard of care treatment. In the full study, there were 204 patients enrolled, and for the primary endpoint, there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 20.5% absolute reduction and 51.6% relative reduction in mortality at Day 60. 

On May 10, 2022, the Company had a pre-EUA meeting with the FDA to discuss next steps including the submission of an EUA application regarding sabizabulin for COVID-19. The outcome of this meeting was: (i) the FDA agreed that no additional efficacy studies would be required to support an EUA application or a new drug application (NDA); and (ii) the FDA agreed that no additional safety data would be required to support an EUA application and that collection of safety data under the EUA may satisfy the safety requirement for an NDA. The FDA agreed that the request for the EUA is supported by efficacy and safety from our positive Phase 3 COVID-19 study in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS and death and no additional clinical trials are required to support an NDA submission. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization. On July 6, 2022, the Company announced the publication of the results from the Phase 3 COVID-19 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral sabizabulin in The New England Journal of Medicine Evidence. On November 9, 2022, the FDA’s Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) met to review sabizabulin for the EUA in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS. The advisory committee voted 8-5 that the known and potential benefits of sabizabulin when used for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of ARDS do not outweigh the known and potential risks of sabizabulin. However, there was additional discussion around the clinical trial design aspects of a potential confirmatory Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial as a post emergency use authorization requirement. The FDA considers the input of the advisory committee as part of their review of the EUA, but the FDA makes the final decision on the request for EUA application.

The UK’s MHRA informed the Company on July 25, 2022, that the sabizabulin marketing authorization application will receive expedited review. On July 27, 2022, sabizabulin triggered Article 18 in the EU in which the EMA will evaluate sabizabulin to allow emergency use drug access to the EU Member States. On August 22, 2022, Australia’s TGA determined that sabizabulin treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS qualifies for an expedited, provisional registration regulatory pathway.

Development Plan. Based on the positive Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of sabizabulin 9mg for the treatment of hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death, the Company is investigating a number of other clinical trials in infectious diseases for sabizabulin such as: (i) hospitalized COVID-19 patients classified as WHO 3 (no oxygen requirement) and WHO 4 (passive oxygen) without a co-morbidity; (ii) hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 pediatric patients at high risk for ARDS; and (iii) hospitalized adult patients at high risk for ARDS due to other viral induced ARDS-related diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 

Market. Approximately 20% of symptomatic cases require hospitalization with 5% ending up in the ICU. According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been approximately 97.1 million confirmed COVID cases and approximately 1.1 million deaths in the U.S. as of October 31, 2022. 



Oncology Drug Program - Breast Cancer: enobosarm and sabizabulin

Scientific Overview. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women with an estimated 290,560 new cases and 43,780 deaths expected for 2022 with one in eight women developing invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. Breast cancer is heterogenous disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. The initial molecular assessment is to determine hormone receptor status, ER and progesterone receptor (PR), as well as HER2 status. Up to 85% of breast cancers are ER+, and consequently, estrogen is one of the main drivers of breast cancer proliferation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Treatments that target the ER have been the mainstay of breast cancer therapy, but unfortunately almost all women will eventually develop resistance to endocrine therapies and alternative treatment approaches will be required including IV chemotherapy. Metastatic triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer that occurs in approximately 15% of all breast cancers. This form of breast cancer does not express ER, PR, or HER2 and is resistant to endocrine therapies. The first line of treatment usually includes IV taxane chemotherapy. Almost all women will eventually develop drug resistance and have tumor progression.

Targeting the AR has the potential to be the next important endocrine therapy for women with breast cancer. 1) AR is the most abundantly expressed steroid receptor in breast cancer being detected in between 70 to 95% of breast cancer specimens; 2) Androgen receptor agonists inhibit cellular proliferation and have antitumor efficacy in ER+ human breast cancer models; and 3) the presence of AR in breast cancer specimens predicts favorable disease-free survival and overall survival. 

Enobosarm is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity that is a member of a new class of endocrine drugs called selective androgen receptor agonists, which means it is both an agonist and an antagonist depending on the tissue type. Enobosarm binds to the AR in breast tissue and inhibits AR+ ER+ breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in animal models. Unlike testosterone, enobosarm cannot be aromatized to estrogen. Enobosarm has selective clinical properties that could have potential benefit in women with AR+ ER+ HER2- breast cancer. Preclinical studies have shown that enobosarm builds and heals cortical and trabecular bone with the potential to treat osteoporosis and skeletal related cancer events. Enobosarm has been shown to build muscle and improve physical function, as well as reduce fat, in clinical studies involving elderly subjects and patients with cancer cachexia including breast cancer. Furthermore, the tissue selectivity of enobosarm results in a favorable side effect profile with no masculinizing adverse effects (facial hair and acne), no increase in hematocrit, and no liver toxicity. Enobosarm has extensive nonclinical and clinical experience having been evaluated in 25 separate clinical studies in approximately 1,450 subjects dosed, including three Phase 2 clinical studies in advanced AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer involving more than 250 patients.

Sabizabulin is an oral, first-in-class small molecule that targets, binds to, and crosslinks the alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules to arrest dividing cancer cells. Furthermore, sabizabulin causes apoptosis, or cell death by cleaving poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which is important for DNA repair in cancer cells. Sabizabulin has high oral bioavailability; less possibility for drug resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins (P-glycoprotein); and minimal potential for drug-to-drug interactions. Sabizabulin has shown in preclinical studies to have efficacy against many tumor types including castration resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes as well as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia, glioma, and pancreatic cancer.

Enobosarm for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. In the two Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in women with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer, enobosarm demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy in heavily pretreated cohorts and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. 

The first Phase 2 clinical trial (G200801) was a single arm study evaluating 9mg oral daily dose of enobosarm in a heavily pretreated endocrine resistant cohort of 22 subjects with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The patients participating in the study on average had 3 (range 1-5) previous lines of endocrine therapy and 68% had previous chemotherapy. The CBR at 6 months was 35.3% (90% CI:16.6%, 58%). Progression free probability was 57.5% at Day 84 and 50.5% at Day 168. The 6-month Kaplan-Meier estimate for radiographic progression free survival was 43.8%. Enobosarm was well tolerated without evidence of masculinization, no increase in hematocrit, and no liver toxicity. 



The second Phase 2 clinical trial (G200802) was a 2-arm study evaluating 9mg and 18mg enobosarm daily oral dosing in 136 women with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The patients in this study were also heavily pretreated having failed an average of 3.7 endocrine treatments, 90% had received prior chemotherapy, and 12% had prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor. Enobosarm showed efficacy with a CBR at 6 months which for 9mg was 32% (95% CI 19.5%,46.7%) and for the 18mg cohort was 29% (95% CI 17.1%,43.1%). The median duration of clinical benefit was not reached for the 9mg group (8.2 month - Not reached) and for the 18mg group was 14.1 months (11 months - 16.5 months). A post-hoc AR expression subset analysis using the AR testing measure used in G200802 was also performed in this population with known AR status and measurable disease (n=84). Objective tumor responses correlated with the degree of % AR staining. Using a 40% AR staining cutoff, CBR at 24 weeks for ≥40% AR was 52% and <40% AR was 14% (p<0.0004). Overall response rate in subjects with ≥40% AR staining was 34% and <40% AR was 2.7% (p=0.0003). Median radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) for ≥40% AR was 5.47 months (95% CI 2.83-11.13) versus <40% AR was 2.73 months (95% CI 2.63 – 2.80) (p<0.001). Enobosarm treatment was well tolerated with significant positive effects on quality-of-life measurements. The 9 mg group had a slightly better safety profile than the 18 mg group.

In summary, treatment with enobosarm, a novel oral selective androgen receptor agonist, resulted in clinically significant objective tumor responses, improvement in quality of life, and favorable safety profile in a heavily pretreated population of women with AR+ER-HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Higher % AR nuclei staining correlated with a greater antitumor activity. By targeting and activating AR in breast cancer tumors with sufficient AR expression, women with metastatic breast cancer may be identified who are most likely to respond to enobosarm therapy. Overall, these studies of enobosarm clearly establish the clinical relevance of targeting the AR with a selective AR agonist. Enobosarm introduces a novel endocrine therapy to patients with breast cancer that have exhausted endocrine therapies targeting ER, but prior to IV chemotherapy.

Development Plan: Current and Planned Clinical Trials.

Phase 3 clinical study – Enobosarm as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling the Phase 3 multicenter, international, open label, and randomized (1:1) ARTEST registration clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm monotherapy versus physician’s choice of either exemestane  everolimus or a SERM as the active comparator for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 210 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We have identified that patients who have sufficient androgen receptor nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue are most likely to respond to enobosarm. Based on the recommendation of the FDA to have a companion diagnostic test to determine the patient’s AR status, we are partnering with Roche/Ventana Diagnostics, a global oncology diagnostics company, who will develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic AR test.

Phase 2b clinical study – Sabizabulin as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We also intend to conduct a Phase 2b clinical study of sabizabulin, a novel oral microtubule disruptor, for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining. The Phase 2b clinical trial will be an open label, multicenter, and randomized (1:1) study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sabizabulin 32mg monotherapy versus active comparator (exemestane ± everolimus or a SERM, physician’s choice) for the treatment of ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 200 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. 

Phase 3 clinical study – Enobosarm + abemaciclib combination as a 2nd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling a Phase 3 multicenter, open label, randomized (1:1), active control clinical study, named ENABLAR-2 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm plus abemaciclib combination therapy versus an alternative estrogen blocking agent (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor) in subjects with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer who have failed first line palbociclib (a CDK 4/6 inhibitor) plus an estrogen blocking agent (non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) and have a sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue. We plan to enroll approximately 186 subjects in this Phase 3 clinical study.



Market. Enobosarm represents the first new class of targeted endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer in decades. Enobosarm targets AR in AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer as a potential second line and/or third line oral daily dosing endocrine therapy. Oral sabizabulin could provide a non-endocrine oral therapy. Both enobosarm and sabizabulin could be an option in hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patients that have exhausted endocrine therapies targeting ER, but prior to IV chemotherapy. We believe that the global annual market for an oral agent in an ER endocrine resistant setting would be similar to that for CDK 4/6 inhibitor drugs which is an $18 billion dollar market. 

Oncology Drug Program – Prostate Cancer: sabizabulin, VERU-100 and zuclomiphene citrate 

Sabizabulin, an oral, first-in-class microtubule disruptor small molecule for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer.

Scientific Overview. In the U.S. there were an estimated 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths from prostate cancer expected in 2022. Five percent of men with prostate cancer will have metastatic cancer and up to 30% of men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer will develop metastatic cancer following initial therapy in the U.S. The median survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer ranges from 3.2-4.5 years. For these men, the first line therapy is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or medical castration. Although most will initially respond, nearly all these patients will progress to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and have a poor prognosis with an average survival of 1.5 years. New second line androgen receptor targeting agents, like XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) have resulted in an additional four to five months of average survival, but again, nearly all men on these agents will eventually develop progressive metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent prostate cancer within 12-15 months. 

Sabizabulin is an oral, first-in-class small molecule that targets, binds to, and crosslinks the alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules of cells resulting in disruption of the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, sabizabulin causes apoptosis, or cell death by cleaving poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which is important for DNA repair in cancer cells. Sabizabulin has high oral bioavailability, less possibility for drug resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins (P-glycoprotein), and minimal potential for drug-to-drug interactions. Sabizabulin has shown in preclinical studies to have efficacy against many tumor types including castration resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes as well as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia, glioma, and pancreatic cancer. In current clinical prostate cancer studies, sabizabulin appears to be well tolerated with no clinically meaningful neurotoxicity and no neutropenia, which are common side effects of taxanes and vinca alkaloids anti-microtubule chemotherapy agents. 

Development Plan. The Company is developing sabizabulin as a treatment for men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to androgen receptor targeting agents like ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) or XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and prior to proceeding to IV chemotherapy (prechemotherapy). In September 2018, the Company completed a pre-Investigational New Drug Application (IND) meeting with the FDA for sabizabulin in which the FDA agreed with the Company’s plans for a Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trials. The Company submitted an IND and initiated an open label Phase 1b clinical trial in January 2019 at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center and four other clinical centers. The Phase 1b clinical study has completed enrollment of 39 men with castration resistant prostate cancer who have become resistant to androgen receptor targeting agent and may have had prior taxane IV chemotherapy. Based on the Phase 1b clinical study, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 63mg oral daily continuous dosing as daily chronic drug administration appears to be feasible and safe. The recommended Phase 2 dose is well tolerated as there have been no reports of neutropenia, neurotoxicity, or Grade 3 diarrhea. The Phase 2 clinical study has completed enrollment of approximately 41 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to androgen receptor targeting agents, such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide, but prior to proceeding to IV chemotherapy. In the Phase1b/2 clinical studies, there was evidence of both cytotoxic and cytostatic antitumor efficacy including PSA declines and objective tumor responses (partial and complete responses), and sabizabulin was well tolerated with no reported clinically relevant neutropenia or neurotoxicity. The safety profile appears to be similar to what has been reported in the FDA package inserts for an androgen receptor targeting agent, enzalutamide or abiraterone. 



In July 2020, the Company had a meeting with the FDA and received positive input from the FDA on the pivotal Phase 3 trial design for sabizabulin. The Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study, initiated in June 2021, is an open label, randomized (2:1), multicenter, registration study evaluating sabizabulin 32mg daily dosing versus an alternative androgen receptor targeting agent as the active control in men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who had tumor progression while taking at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to IV chemotherapy. The Phase 3 VERACITY study has a primary endpoint of median radiographic progression-free survival and is currently enrolling, and we expect to enroll 245 men from approximately 45 clinical sites across the U.S.

Current and Planned Clinical Trials

Phase 1b/2 clinical studies to determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended dosing of sabizabulin. We are completing the Phase 1b open label clinical trial of sabizabulin in 39 men with metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer ± taxane chemotherapy and the Phase 2 clinical study in 41 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to proceeding to IV taxane chemotherapy. In the Phase 1b/2 studies, sabizabulin was both well tolerated and demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy data. 

Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study. We are currently enrolling the Phase 3 VERACITY registration study evaluating sabizabulin 32mg in approximately 245 men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who had tumor progression while receiving at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to IV chemotherapy.

Market. Sabizabulin 32mg is being developed for metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer prior to IV chemotherapy. The potential U.S. market for oral cancer therapies in advanced prostate cancer is expected to be over $6.5 billion in 2022. Furthermore, sabizabulin may be a candidate for further development for the broader oncology market as it has shown in preclinical studies to have efficacy against many other tumor types, including triple negative breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes as well as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia, glioma, and pancreatic cancer.

VERU-100, a novel, proprietary, long-acting, GnRH antagonist peptide three-month depot subcutaneous injection formulation for androgen deprivation therapy for advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

Scientific Overview. Androgen deprivation therapy remains the mainstay primary first line therapy for advanced prostate cancer, but current androgen deprivation therapy products, such as LUPRON DEPOT® (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension), for injection; ELIGARD® (leuprolide acetate), for injectable suspension, for subcutaneous use; FIRMAGON® (degarelix for injection), for subcutaneous use; and ZOLADEX® (goserelin implant) have several important clinical shortfalls. LUPRON, ELIGARD, and ZOLADEX are LHRH agonists whose initial administration leads to an initial 14 to 21-day testosterone surge (flare) and interval micro-elevations (spikes or escapes) in testosterone blood concentrations. FIRMAGON, a GnRH antagonist, is a large-volume subcutaneous injection formulation designed for only a single month release. FIRMAGON requires a loading dose of two 3 mL subcutaneous injections followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 4 mL subcutaneous injection repeated. ORGOVYX® (relugolix tablets), an oral GnRH antagonist may potentially have compliance concerns through a patient’s reluctance or failure to take oral medicine as prescribed. There are no GnRH antagonist depot formulations commercially approved beyond a one-month duration injection. In contrast, VERU-100 is designed to address a number of these important clinical shortfalls of currently marketed androgen deprivation therapy products: VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous three-month depot injection without a loading dose. VERU-100, as a GnRH antagonist, immediately suppresses testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration unlike what occurs with the currently approved LHRH agonists. As VERU-100 is a long-acting injected depot, there are no concerns with patient compliance while on treatment. Furthermore, as a class, GnRH antagonists have been shown to have fewer cardiovascular adverse events than LHRH agonists in men on androgen deprivation therapy.



Development Plan. The Company had a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in May 2019 clarifying the requirements for full regulatory development pathway. The FDA agreed to an expedited regulatory development pathway for VERU-100. The Company is conducting a single Phase 2 dose finding, open label, multicenter clinical study of VERU 100 in men with advanced prostate cancer (approximately 45 patients) for a single three-month injection. As of November 15, 2022, 22 patients have been dosed in the Phase 2 study. FDA has agreed to the design of the registration study which will be a Phase 3-open label single arm clinical study in men with advanced prostate cancer (n=100) using the achievement and maintenance of castration levels of testosterone as the primary endpoint.

Current and Planned Clinical Trials

Phase 2 dose finding clinical study. Currently enrolling study to determine optimal dose of VERU-100 in men with advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer. 

Phase 3 registration clinical study. If the Phase 2 trial is successful, and as discussed with and agreed upon by the FDA, the Phase 3 clinical trial will be a single arm, multicenter, open-label study in approximately 100 men with hormone sensitive advanced prostate cancer using the achievement and maintenance of castration levels of testosterone as the primary endpoint. The Phase 3 registration study is planned to initiate in calendar year 2023.

Market. VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist for androgen deprivation therapy designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous three-month depot injection without a loading dose. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists commercially approved beyond a one-month depot injection, making VERU-100, if approved, the only commercially available GnRH antagonist three-month depot. Global sales of androgen deprivation therapy drugs in 2022 are estimated to be greater than $2.9 billion.

Zuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.

Scientific Overview.  The estimated prevalence of prostate cancer in the U.S. is 3 million cases for which over one-third are on androgen deprivation therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy results in very low, castrate levels of testosterone. Eliminating testosterone is an effective therapy as testosterone is a powerful growth factor for prostate cancer. As estrogen is derived from testosterone in men, low levels in testosterone also results in very low levels of estrogen. Low estrogen side effects include hot flashes, bone loss and fractures, loss of libido, memory disturbances, and adverse blood lipid changes. 

Hot flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms, are one of the most common and debilitating side effects of prostate cancer hormonal therapies. Hormone therapies include ADT, like LUPRON® and ELIGARD® (leuprolide), FIRMAGON® (degarelix), ZOLADEX® (goserelin), ORGOVYX® (relugolix tablets), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA® (abiraterone), XTANDI® (enzalutamide), ERLEADA® (apalutamide), and NUBEQA® (darolutamide). Up to 80% of men on androgen deprivation therapy complain of hot flashes with 30-40% having moderate to severe hot flashes. Patients on androgen deprivation therapy report significant effects on daily functioning and quality of life. Hot flashes are one of the main reasons that prostate cancer patients want to delay or stop being treated by androgen deprivation therapy. 

Hormonal and nonhormonal therapies have been used off-label to treat hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies. In general, use of off-label hormonal agents, especially estrogens, have been shown to be helpful for treating hot flashes. However, off-label estrogen treatment is complicated by lack of consistent dosing and known side effects such as gynecomastia (breast enlargement), gynecodynia (painful breasts), and increase in thromboembolic events like deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and stroke. Progesterone hormone agents, like MEGACE ES® (megesterol acetate suspension), have also been used off-label but the side effects include weight gain, increase in thromboembolic events like deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and stroke, and the potential to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer. Nonhormonal agents that also have been used off-label include antiseizure agents and antidepressants that have serious and unwanted side effects. Moreover, nonhormonal agents have demonstrated less effectiveness than hormonal therapies for the treatment of hot flashes. There are no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer. As estrogen deficiency is the reason for the hot flashes, we believe that zuclomiphene citrate, a nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist, has the potential to replace estrogen and be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for hot flashes caused by androgen deprivation therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer.



Development Plan. In June 2018, the Company submitted an IND with the FDA for zuclomiphene citrate. In September 2018, the Company enrolled its first subject in the Phase 2 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled dose finding study evaluating two doses of oral daily zuclomiphene citrate (10mg or 50mg) treatment versus placebo in approximately 95 men with advanced prostate cancer who have ADT induced moderate to severe hot flashes. The clinical study had a treatment duration of 12 weeks and was being conducted in 24 clinical centers in the U.S. The primary endpoint was the frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes. Secondary endpoints included severity of hot flashes and improvement in bone marker. Upon review of the Phase 2 clinical data, we believe a higher dose of zuclomiphene may be more efficacious against hot flashes with acceptable safety. Consequently, the Company plans to further optimize the dosing of zuclomiphene citrate in a Phase 2b clinical trial in men with advanced prostate cancer who experience moderate to severe hot flashes. 

Planned Clinical Trial

Phase 2b zuclomiphene citrate clinical study. The Company reported positive dose finding Phase 2 study in January 2020. The Company plans to further optimize the dosing schedule of zuclomiphene citrate in a Phase 2b study. 

Market. Hot flashes are the most common side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapy, with hot flashes occurring in approximately 80% of men receiving one of the common forms of androgen deprivation therapy, including like LUPRON® and ELIGARD® (leuprolide), FIRMAGON® (degarelix), ZOLADEX® (goserelin), ORGOVYX® (relugolix tablets), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA® (abiraterone), XTANDI® (enzalutamide), ERLEADA® (apalutamide), and NUBEQA® (darolutamide, and about up to 40% of such men experience moderate to severe hot flashes. The potential patient population for zuclomiphene citrate is the approximately 480,000 men annually in the U.S. who suffer from ADT-induced hot flashes. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies.

Sexual Health Program

The Company's sexual health program includes two FDA-approved commercial products, ENTADFI™ (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use, for the treatment of BPH, and FC2, for the dual protection against unplanned pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.

ENTADFI™ (finasteride and tadalafil) capsules, for oral use. ENTADFI was approved by the FDA in December 2021 as a new oral treatment for BPH, or an enlarged prostate gland. The co-administration of tadalafil and finasteride has been shown to provide faster and more effective treatment of BPH than finasteride alone without causing unwanted sexual side effects. The FDA had been reviewing our product release criteria from our contract manufacturing facility and has now given its approval. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated the U.S. commercial launch and availability of ENTADFI. We plan to market ENTADFI to healthcare providers and patients through the traditional digital marketing channels and distribution will also be conducted through the normal pharmaceutical distribution channels. We plan to augment our marketing and sales efforts by seeking partners in the U.S. that offer us the ability to expand access through telemedicine and internet pharmacy services and will continue our search for the right commercial partners outside the U.S.

Market. The worldwide prevalence of BPH lower urinary symptoms is estimated to be 10-25% of the male population. According to IQVIA, the top 3 deciles of Urologist (n = 958) Healthcare Practitioners in the U.S. average 775 finasteride total prescriptions per health care provider per year. ENTADFI is an FDA-approved, first in class combination of tadalafil and finasteride indicated to treat BPH with low potential for adverse sexual side effects, and we believe that ENTADFI being one single pill would help increase drug compliance whereas poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to an increased chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death. 

FC2 Female Condom for dual protection against unintended pregnancy and transmission of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDs

Product. FC2 is the only FDA-approved internal condom for the prevention of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV/AIDs. It is also the only non-hormonal, latex free contraceptive option available to women that can be used with most other forms of contraception providing “layering” benefits. It is easy to use and covered by most insurance companies with zero out-of-pocket costs due to the Affordable Care Act. 

 


FC2 offers several benefits over natural rubber latex, the raw material most used in male condoms. FC2’s nitrile polymer is stronger than latex, reducing the probability that the female condom sheath will tear during use. Unlike latex, FC2’s nitrile polymer quickly transfers heat. FC2 can warm to body temperature immediately upon insertion, which may enhance the user’s sensation and pleasure. Unlike the male condom, FC2 may be inserted before sex, eliminating disruption during sexual intimacy. FC2 is also an alternative to latex sensitive users who are unable to use male condoms without irritation. For example, 7% to 21% of the individuals with significant exposure to latex rubber (i.e., health care workers) experience such irritation. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reported allergy to the nitrile polymer. FC2 is pre-lubricated, disposable, and approved for single use to prevent pregnancy and the transfer of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

FC2 is manufactured from a nitrile polymer formulation that is proprietary to the Company and consists of a soft, loose-fitting sheath and two rings: an external ring of rolled nitrile and a loose internal ring made of flexible polyurethane. FC2’s soft sheath lines the vagina, preventing skin-to-skin contact during intercourse. Its external ring remains outside the vagina, partially covering the external genitalia. The internal ring is used for insertion and helps keep the device in place during use.

In the U.S., FC2 is available by prescription through multiple telemedicine and internet pharmacy channels as well as retail pharmacies. The Company has launched its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal/platform to continue to drive sales growth. FC2 is also available to public health sector entities such as state departments of health and 501(c)(3) organizations.

Currently, most of the Company’s net revenues are derived from sales of FC2 in the commercial and public health sectors.

U.S. Market. There are approximately 19 million women between the ages of 18-49 who represent the target market within the contraceptive market. According to the CDC, preliminary data suggests that STIs in U.S. will continue to increase in 2021 – an all-time high for the 6th straight year increasing from 2.4 million to 2.5 million.

FC2 is the only FDA approved for market female use product that protects against unintended pregnancies, the transmission of STIs and HIV/AIDs. While the market conditions are favorable for continued growth, the brand has seen decreasing sales due to lower volume from telemedicine customers because of some business challenges experienced by our customers which has resulted in a slow-down in orders over the past two quarters. As a result, the Company has established its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine (telemedicine being the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology) platform and we have recently partnered with highly reputable telemedicine pharmacy fulfillment partner to bring our much-needed FC2 product to patients in a cost-effective and highly convenient manner. We are working to restore historical ordering patterns with these partners in future quarters and we are working to grow revenues from our dedicated telemedicine solution while leveraging opportunities that help couples better understand how FC2 can help them take control of their sexual and reproductive health.

FC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA was signed into law in March 2010 and was intended to help make prevention services affordable and accessible for all Americans by requiring most health insurance plans to provide coverage without cost sharing for certain recommended preventive services. Preventive services that have strong scientific evidence of their health benefits must be covered and plans can no longer charge a patient a copayment, coinsurance or deductible for these services when they are delivered by a network provider. ACA guidance defines preventive services to include contraception methods. The ACA guidance further requires health plans to cover at 100% payment of at least one form of contraception within each of the 16 different categories identified by the FDA in its current Birth Control Guide in which FC2 is in a standalone category of its own. As FC2 is nonhormonal, it is a viable alternative for many U.S. women who have reported dissatisfaction with the side effects of hormonal birth control or are seeking the layering (i.e. STI prevention) benefits FC2 offers since it can be used with many other forms of contraception. 



We have built the infrastructure to allow for broad access across the U.S. As a result, FC2 is now available through multiple access channels including: 95% of major retail pharmacies, community-based organizations, by prescription, universities, direct purchase and 340B qualified health care clinics, and directly to the public health sector without distributors. Additionally, we are executing digital and social marketing strategies intended to drive brand interest, awareness, and education; address misconceptions about the brand; and ultimately, help ensure women know they can easily access FC2 and that it is fully reimbursable.

Global Public Health Sector Market. In the global public sector, FC2 has been cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO) for purchase by U.N. agencies because it is a multipurpose prevention technology by preventing unintended pregnancy and the transmission of STIs, while protecting against HIV/AIDs. The Company markets FC2 to entities, including ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, nonprofit organizations, and commercial partners, that work to support and improve the lives, health and well-being of women around the world since various governments and organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.

The Company currently has a limited number of customers in the global public health sector that include large global agencies, such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Brazil Ministry of Health through Semina Indústria e Comércio Ltda (Semina), the Company’s distributor in Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa health authorities that purchase through the Company’s various local distributors. Other customers in the global public health sector include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, local sexual health distributors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The Company has sold more than 700 million female condoms worldwide and FC2 has been distributed in the U.S. and 149 other countries. A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world. The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and unintended pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the world’s most underprivileged people. However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications, and processing orders.

The global market for male condoms is estimated to be worth up to $9.4 billion annually. The female condom market represents a very small portion of the total global condom market, yet 53% of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are women. Consequently, a number of independent women’s groups are advocating for increased investment in and distribution of female condoms on a gender equality basis.

The Company has distribution agreements and other arrangements with commercial partners which market FC2 as a consumer health product through distributors and retailers in 22 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. These agreements are generally exclusive for a single country. Under these agreements, the Company sells FC2 to the distributor partners, who market and distribute the product to consumers in the established territory. 

Sale of PREBOOST® Business

On December 8, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold substantially all of the assets related to the Company's PREBOOST® business. PREBOOST® is a 4% benzocaine medicated individual wipe for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The transaction closed on December 8, 2020. The purchase price for the transaction was $20.0 million, consisting of $15.0 million paid at closing, $2.5 million payable 12 months after closing and $2.5 million payable 18 months after closing. The Company has received all such purchase price payments.

Government Regulation 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.



FDA Regulation of Female Condoms. FC2 was approved for market by the FDA, via a Premarket Approval Application (PMA), as a Class III medical device in 2009. On September 21, 2018, the FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condom from Class III to Class II medical devices, renaming them “single-use internal condoms” and requiring new devices in this category to submit a 510(k) premarket notification and comply with various “special controls.” Special controls are a battery of product clinical testing which includes, but is not limited to, determining product effectiveness against pregnancy and against sexual transmitted infection transmission, and product tolerability. Companies seeking clearance of new single-use internal condoms may now do so by demonstrating to the FDA in a 510(k) submission that a proposed condom is substantially equivalent to FC2 with respect to intended use and technology.

All marketed devices cleared or approved by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. For example, we are required to register our manufacturing establishments with the FDA and list FC2 with the FDA as a commercially distributed device. We must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires that devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to, among other things, manufacturing, testing, and control activities. We must comply with the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, which requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our FC2 devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must also maintain records of any corrections or removal of FC2 and make reports to the FDA of certain corrections or removals. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling, promotion and advertising. Any future modifications to the design, components, methods of manufacturing, or labeling of FC2 that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, require a new 510(k) clearance. Non-compliance with any of these requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, total or partial suspension of production, and criminal prosecution.

Because FC2 is a commercially distributed medical device, the facilities in which FC2 is manufactured and tested are subject to periodic FDA inspection to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including the QSR and MDR regulations. The Company’s most recent FDA inspection of its U.K. and Malaysian facilities was completed in September 2010 and November 2019, respectively.

FDA Regulation of Prescription Pharmaceutical Products. The process required by the FDA before pharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP); and
FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a drug candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) or independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.



In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the drug candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.

Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.

Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible, or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. Approval on the basis of a single trial may be subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

Emergency Use Authorizations.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize unapproved medical products to be manufactured, marketed, and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. After an emergency has been announced, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize EUAs for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute, including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. An EUA is subject to additional conditions and restrictions, such as the obligation to provide fact sheets for healthcare providers administering the product and those to whom it is administered, adverse event monitoring and reporting, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements by product manufacturers. The FDA may also establish additional discretionary conditions of authorization that the FDA deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, including conditions related to product distribution, product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product. In issuing an EUA, the FDA considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality, safety and efficacy, including the known and potential risks of such products and the adequacy and availability of approved alternatives, among other factors. An EUA is not a substitute for obtaining FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for use of a product. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates, and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances, the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict. 

Outside the U.S., the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that differ from those in the U.S. These processes and requirements also vary widely from country to country, region to region, and regulatory authority to regulatory authority.



The COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have submitted an application for an EUA in the US and similar applications in the United Kingdom and the European Union for sabizabulin in certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

505(b)(2) Approval Process. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides an expedited regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). The FDA may require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or provide other data to support any change from the RLD. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

We expect our zuclomiphene citrate and VERU-100 drug candidates to be submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway because they are or will be based, in part, on data or information already in the public domain. 

Orange Book Listing. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii statement” certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 

505(b)(1) Approval Process. Drug development via Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA is typically used for novel drugs that have not previously been approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the U.S or a new indication for a drug previously approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the U.S. 505(b)(1) drug development stipulates that all of the studies required for approval are conducted by or for the Company. Sabizabulin for metastatic castration and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer and sabizabulin for taxane resistant metastatic triple negative breast cancer, as well as enobosarm for ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and an NDA for sabizabulin for certain hospitalized COVID-19 and other infectious disease indications are expected to follow this regulatory pathway.



NDA Submission and Review by the FDA. The results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA’s goal to complete the review process for a non-priority review of an NDA under 505(b)(2) or 505(b)(1) is ten months from submission for a non-new chemical entity and ten months from filing for a new chemical entity and for a priority review is six months from submission for a non-new chemical entity and six months from filing for a new chemical entity to complete the review process for the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a complete response letter or approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 

Post-Approval Requirements for Pharmaceutical Products. Any pharmaceutical products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are supported by appropriate evidence. Generally, these are found in the approved prescribing information. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use. 

The Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical human drug products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier, and maintain certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

 


Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Regulation of Advertising. The FTC regulates OTC drug and non-restricted medical device advertising and promotional materials under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices as well as the dissemination of any false advertisement that is likely to induce the purchase of drugs and non-restricted medical devices. The FTC requires that all express and implied claims must be substantiated. The FTC has historically applied a standard of competent and reliable scientific evidence for health-related claims. This standard is defined generally to require tests, analyses, research or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. In some instances, the FTC has interpreted this standard as requiring randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The FTC is authorized to issue cease-and-desist orders enforceable by injunctions, civil penalties, and criminal contempt proceedings for violating the FTC Act, as well as to proceed directly in federal court for injunctive relief and to obtain ancillary consumer redress.

Other Healthcare Regulations. Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal health care program anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”) and state equivalents, the Federal False Claims Act and state equivalents, federal and state health care practitioner payment sunshine laws, federal and state health information privacy laws, state price increase transparency laws, and various federal laws requiring price reporting or discounted pricing to the government. 

The AKS prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 

We and our business activities are subject to the Medicare/Medicaid civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

Additionally, the federal practitioner payment sunshine requirements within the ACA and its implementing regulations require certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, certain other health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, such practitioners or teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 



In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in the countries in which we do business relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules.

Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business. 

The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 

Anti-Corruption Laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar anti-corruption laws, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act.

Foreign and Other Regulation. In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

FC2 has MSAP and ISO13485 approval by regulatory authorities which covers Australian TGA, Brazil ANVISA, Health Canada, and other jurisdictions. Also, FC2 received the CE Mark which allows it to be marketed throughout the EU.

The Company’s facility may also be subject to inspection by UNFPA, USAID, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and country specific ministries of health. 



Intellectual Property

We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.

Sabizabulin and Related Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to twelve issued U.S. patents, ten pending U.S. patent applications and 107 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States, including issued patents in the EU and Japan, relating to our sabizabulin drug candidates and related compounds. This license contains provisions requiring upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (Ohio State Innovation Foundation). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. The patents and applications relating to sabizabulin and related compounds have statutory expiration dates from 2029 to 2041. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.

Other Non-Sabizabulin Antitubulin Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to two U.S. patent applications and one world patent application (PCT) from which we could enter many countries outside the U.S. This license is relating to non-sabizabulin anti-tubulin compounds. This license contains provisions requiring diligence milestones, and upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (University of Tennessee Research Foundation). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. The U.S. patent application and any patents issuing from the PCT patent applications would expire in April 2042.

VERU-100 Patent Applications. We have three U.S. patent applications and fifteen patent applications in countries outside the United States relating to the long-term release of a GnRH antagonist hormone for ADT for men with advanced prostate cancer. The U.S. patent applications and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in January 2038. 

Enobosarm and Related Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to sixteen issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications and 67 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States, including issued Composition of Matter and Method of Use patents in the EU and Japan, relating to our enobosarm drug candidate and related compounds. This license contains provisions requiring milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (University of Tennessee Research Foundation). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize our drug candidate. The patents relating to enobosarm and related compounds have statutory expiration dates from 2024 to 2034. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.

Zuclomiphene Citrate Patent and Patent Applications. We have three issued U.S. patents and thirteen patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States related to substantially pure zuclomiphene for the treatment of hot flashes, osteoporosis, bone fractures, and loss of bone mineral density, especially in men on prostate cancer hormone therapies. The U.S. patent and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in July 2035. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.

FC2 Patents.  FC2 patents have been issued by the United States, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and India. The patents cover key aspects of FC2, including its overall design and manufacturing process. The patents have expiration dates in 2023 and 2024.

Trademarks. The Company has a registration for the trademark “FC2 Female Condom” and the FC2 Female Condom stylized logo in the U.S. and a pending registration for “ENTADFI” and the ENTADFI stylized logo in the U.S. The Company has filed applications in the U.S. for the trademarks “Veru” and “Veru” together with the chevron. The Company has filed applications or secured registrations in 40 countries or jurisdictions around the world to protect the various names and symbols used in marketing its Female Condoms. 



We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business. 

In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations or enforcement in the U.S. and other countries by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

The term of an individual patent depends upon the legal term for patents in the country in which such patent is obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.

As with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property positions for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, certain patent applications that we have filed or may file, or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of corresponding patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim intellectual property to which we have rights, we may have to participate in proceedings in the USPTO to determine invention rights, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any related patent may remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and by using invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of intellectual property that is developed through a relationship with a third party.



Significant Customers

The Company's two largest customers in fiscal 2022 accounted for 73% of the Company’s net revenues. In the U.S. market, the Company has experienced fast growth in prescription sales of FC2 in prior years largely through supply agreements with leading telemedicine providers. 

Because FC2 is multipurpose prevention technology that provides prevention of pregnancy and transmission of STIs, including HIV/AIDS, it is an integral part of HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning programs throughout the world. These programs are typically supplied by global public health sector buyers who purchase products for distribution, at low cost or no cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products themselves. Within the global public health sector are large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, the U.K.’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), DKT and Population Services International (PSI), other social marketing groups, various government health agencies, and NGOs. Within the global public health sector, the Company’s most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies, country specific ministries of health, or those who facilitate their purchases and/or distribution. 

Human Capital Management 

As of October 31, 2022, the Company had 233 full-time employees, including 65 located in the U.S., 11 in the U.K., 156 in Malaysia, and one in another country to implement training and programs. The Company does not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with its employees, and the Company believes that its employee relations are good.

Our key human capital management objectives are to identify, recruit, integrate, retain and motivate our new and existing employees. We are committed to fostering an environment where all employees can grow and thrive. A diverse workforce results in a broader range of perspectives, helping drive our commitment to growth. We believe that our compensation and benefit programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain qualified talent. To create and maintain a successful work environment, we offer an annual base salary and a comprehensive package of additional benefits that support the physical and mental health and wellness of all of our employees and their families. Additionally, we may also grant equity awards to attract and promote employee retention, with such awards presently vesting over a three-year period, and to allow for employees to share in the performance of the Company.

We are committed to a safe workplace for our employees and have implemented health and safety management processes into our operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented additional safety measures for the protection of our employees, including work-from-home measures for applicable employees and additional cleaning and protective measures.

Environmental Regulation 

The Company believes there are no material issues or material costs associated with the Company's compliance with environmental laws. The Company did not incur environmental expenses in fiscal 2022 or 2021, nor does it anticipate environmental expenses in the foreseeable future. The Company’s operations in Malaysia are audited and certified against ISO 14001, the environmental management standard that was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to help organizations manage the environmental impacts of their processes, products, and services.
Raw Materials 

The principal raw material used to produce FC2 is a nitrile polymer. While general nitrile formulations are available from a number of suppliers, the Company has chosen to work closely with the technical market leader in synthetic polymers to develop a grade ideally suited to the biocompatibility and functional needs of a female condom. As a result, the Company relies on supply for its principal raw material for FC2 from one supplier that could produce the raw material from multiple supply points within its organization. The principal partially finished component used to produce FC2 is a dipped nitrile polymer sheath. The Company procures its component sheaths from one of the leading manufacturers of nitrile surgical gloves. 
Manufacturing 

We manufacture and warehouse FC2 within a leased facility with approximately 45,800 square feet of space in Selangor D.E., Malaysia. Production capacity at this facility is approximately 100 million units of FC2 annually. This facility is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to ensure compliance with cGMP, as well as the Germany-based notified body, which is responsible for CE and ISO accreditation.

The Company is relying on third-party contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package, label and store sufficient quantities of ENTADFI (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use, and sabizabulin, which we have been manufacturing in anticipation of a potential Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA in the U.S. and potentially by regulatory authorities in other countries, and expects to rely on third-parties for any future drug candidates.

Competition

FC2 participates in the same market as male condoms; however, it is not seen as directly competing with male condoms. Rather, studies show that providing FC2 increases use of female as well as male condoms. Male condoms cost less and can have brand names that are more widely recognized than FC2. In addition, male condoms are generally manufactured and marketed by companies with significantly greater financial resources than the Company. 

Other parties have developed and marketed female condoms. None of these female condoms marketed or under development by other parties have secured FDA market approval. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S. USAID, a U.S. government funded agency, prefers to procure from the FDA product approval for market; however, there can be exceptions. Outside of the U.S., the Company has experienced increasing competition and pricing pressures for FC2. In addition to FC2, three female condoms have successfully completed the WHO prequalification process and been cleared by UNFPA for purchase by U.N. agencies: the Cupid female condom (which was prequalified by WHO in July 2012 and cleared by UNFPA thereafter), the Velvet female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016) and the female condom marketed by PATH (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016). The PATH female condom lost its prequalification in 2019, which leaves only two other competitive female condoms with WHO prequalification in addition to FC2. We are not currently aware of any other female condoms currently in the WHO prequalification process. The female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited, which is the Company’s former exclusive distributor in India, is substantially similar in design to FC2, except it is made of latex. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification, especially in the EU. Reflecting increased competition, competitors received part of the last three South African tenders and the last two Brazilian tenders. Increasing competition in FC2’s markets outside the U.S. has, and will likely continue to, put pressure on pricing for FC2 and may also adversely affect sales of FC2. Some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. The FDA’s reclassification of female condoms in 2018 from Class III medical devices to Class II medical devices may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. If other female condoms enter the U.S. market, we may face increased competition in the U.S., which may put downward pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affect sales of FC2 in the U.S. 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. The success of our pharmaceutical products will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for any products for which we receive marketing approval. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of the competitors with respect to our pharmaceutical products under development have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we have or will have.



Sabizabulin is a first-in-class oral therapy that targets and crosslinks both alpha and beta tubulin and is being developed for hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and for breast and prostate cancers. Sabizabulin is first-in-class with this unique targeting and crosslinking of microtubules, which appears to have favorable results in efficacy and safety that is different from other tubulin targeting agents that do not crosslink. Other drugs for moderate to severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS include antivirals like VEKLURY® (remdesivir), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as OLUMIANT® (baricitinib), and monoclonal antibodies such as ACTEMRA® (tocilizumab). 

Sabizabulin is also in development for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer no longer responding to androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor targeting therapy. All currently available tubulin targeting chemotherapy agents are given IV. Vinca Alkaloids, such as VELBAN® (VinBLAStine Sulfate) injection, for intravenous use; ONCOVIN® (vincristine sulfate injection, solution); and NAVELBINE® (vinrelbine) injection, for intravenous use are primarily used for hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, sarcoma), and some neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer and non-small cell cancer of the lung. Taxanes such as TAXOL® (paclitaxel) injection, for intravenous use; TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) injection, for intravenous use; and JEVTANA® (cabazitaxel) injection, for intravenous use are primarily used for solid tumors such as breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical, lung, head and neck, esophageal, bladder, gastric and prostate. TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and JEVTANA® (cabazitaxel) are indicated for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, are given IV and bind to the taxane site of tubulin. The Trop-2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor, TRODELVY® (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for injection, for intravenous use; PARP inhibitors, LYNPARZA® (olaparib) tablets, for oral use and TALZENNA® (talazoparib) capsules, for oral use, capecitabine, TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) injection, for intravenous use and ABRAXANE® for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound), for intravenous use and platinum-based chemotherapies including cisplatin and PARAPLATIN® (carboplatin) injection are indicated for advanced breast cancers such as triple negative breast cancer.

VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist subcutaneous injection formulation for androgen deprivation therapy designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous three-month depot injection without a loading dose. As a GnRH antagonist, it should immediately suppress testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration and no testosterone micro-increases which may adversely affect patient outcomes—a problem which potentially occurs with approved LHRH agonist drugs like LUPRON®, ZOLADEX® and ELIGARD®. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists administered by depot injection that provide castration beyond one month, making VERU-100, if approved, the only commercially available GnRH antagonist three-month depot that would provide castration for such three-month period.

Enobosarm is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity, selective androgen receptor targeting agonist, for the treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer, but prior to IV chemotherapy. Other existing drugs currently prescribed for advanced breast cancer are nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors including, FEMARA® (letrozole) tablets, for oral use and ARIMIDEX® (anastrozole) tablet, for oral use; irreversible steroidal inhibitors including AROMASIN® (exemestane) tablets, for oral use; selective estrogen receptor degraders including FASLODEX® (fulvestrant) injection, for intramuscular use; and CDK 4/6 inhibitors including IBRANCE® (palbociclib) capsules, for oral use, KISQUALI® (ribociclib) tablets, for oral use, and VERZENIO® (abemaciclib). Chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer include the taxanes TAXOL® (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE® (docetaxel), ABRAXANE® (albumin-bound paclitaxel), ADRIAMYCIN® (doxorubicin hydrochloride) injection, solution for intravenous use, ELLENCE® (epirubicin hydrochloride) injection, solution for intravenous use, capecitabine, CYTOXAN® (cyclophosphamide) capsules, for oral use and PARAPLATIN® (carboplatin). 

Zuclomiphene is under development for the treatment of moderate to severe hot flashes in men with advanced prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy. Although there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies, there are several drugs being used off-label, including steroidal estrogens and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants including EFFEXOR® (venlafaxine) capsules, for oral use and anticonvulsants like NEURONTIN® (gabapentin) capsules, for oral use or tablets, for oral use which could be competitive with our zuclomiphene citrate drug candidate for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies.



ENTADFI™ is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate for up to 26 weeks. All drugs currently used to treat BPH symptoms are sold in tablets or capsules. These drugs include those that decrease size of the prostate, like 5 alpha reductase inhibitors which include PROSCAR® (finasteride) and AVODART® (dutasteride). The other major class of drugs treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck and include alpha blockers like FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCI), HYTRIN® (terazosin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin) as well as Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like CIALIS ® (tadalafil). One class of drugs combines a drug that shrinks and another that relaxes the prostate called JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination).
