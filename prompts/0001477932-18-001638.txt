ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as Freeze Tag, Inc. in February 2006 in the State of Delaware. In March 2006, Freeze Tag, LLC, our predecessor which was formed in October 2005, was merged with and into Freeze Tag, Inc. In October of 2017, we completed a merger transaction with Munzee Inc. in a transaction in which Freeze Tag, Inc. became the surviving entity and both companies merged their operations together. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the merger is treated as a “reverse merger” under the purchase method of accounting, with Munzee as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, Munzee’s historical financial results of operations replace Freeze Tag’s historical financial results of operations for all periods prior to the Merger and, for all periods following the Merger, the financial results of operations of the combined company will be included in the Company’s financial statements. The new combined entity maintains offices in Tustin, California and McKinney, Texas. Other corporate actions that occurred as a result of the merger are that Robert Vardeman, Jr., former CEO of Munzee Inc. became President of Freeze Tag, Inc. and both Robert Vardeman, Jr. and Robert D. Vardeman were added to the Freeze Tag, Inc. Board of Directors. The new Board of Directors consists of Craig Holland, Mick Donahoo, Robert Vardeman, Jr., and Robert D. Vardeman. 
Business Overview
 
Freeze Tag, Inc. is a creator of location-based, mobile social games that are fun and engaging for consumers and businesses. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide success, we employ state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy our games for free, and, if they so choose, they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor. 
 
Founded by gaming industry veterans, Freeze Tag has launched several successful games over the course of its history. Our current portfolio includes hits such as Munzee®, a social platform with over 7 million locations worldwide and hundreds of thousands of players that blends gamification and geolocation into an experience that rewards players for going places in the physical world, Garfield Go, a Pokemon Go style augmented reality game based on the iconic cat Garfield, WallaBee®, an addictive collecting game with over 2,000 beautifully drawn digital cards, as well as many social mobile games that provide endless hours of family-friendly fun. We also offer our technology and services to third party businesses that want to leverage mobile gaming in their marketing and branding programs. For example, our Eventzee® solution allows businesses to create private scavenger hunts in physical places such as malls, tradeshows, company events or campuses to create immersive brand experiences.

Our newest location based product, ZeeTours, was launched in December 2017 through a marketing contract with Groupon. ZeeTours is a location-based smartphone game that combines fitness, learning and fun into a zany walking tour.
 
Our mission is to design, develop and deliver innovative digital entertainment that surprises and delights. Our products bring families together by providing fun to kids of all ages. We also strive to create a workplace environment where creativity and fun can thrive in a demanding industry.
 
Business Strategy
 
In recent years, we have shifted our business strategy to focus our efforts on creating free-to-play social games for the mobile market. We’ve made this change because we believe that games that are social and mobile will provide the greatest revenue opportunities now and in the foreseeable future. This change in direction has not been an easy one as we’ve had to deploy resources differently, learn new techniques, and experiment with new game designs and marketing processes. 
 
We have also announced our intention to grow through acquisition. The merger with Munzee Inc. is evidence that we are making progress on our intention to grow the business through merging and/or acquiring other companies in our field. We feel that the time is right to build an alliance of mobile game developers who can become stronger and more successful by working together to build a company that can leverage market intelligence, development expertise and cross-promotional opportunities to achieve great results for our customers and shareholders. In the event we do enter into any such transactions in the future, such transactions will likely be accomplished through the issuance of shares of our stock and/or in connection with a strategic financial investor, and not with cash directly from us unless and until our cash position improves.
 
Augmented Reality and Geo Location Games Market
 
In 2017, we launched Garfield Go, the company’s first augmented reality location based game (prior to the merger with Munzee Inc.). Garfield Go has become popular with our customers and has helped us to become more proficient in the development of augmented reality and location-based applications. We look forward to expanding our portfolio of games and applications that include augmented reality features because we believe that consumers are looking for new and exciting gaming experiences. We believe the future market potential for games and applications for consumers and businesses that include augmented reality is growing and will continue to expand. 
 
According to Digi Capital’s AR/VR report (Digi Capital AR/VR report http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2017/01/after-mixed-year-mobile-ar-to-drive-108-billion-vrar-market-by-2021/#more-1617), Nintendo/The Pokémon Company/Niantic had a breakout success that even they didn’t anticipate with their augmented reality and geolocation games. Pokémon Go delivered $600 million mobile AR revenue in its first three months alone, making more money through the year than the entire virtual reality (VR) games software market in 2016. While this came from a very specific set of circumstances, many mobile game companies are developing strategies to build on the AR and geolocation games market that Pokemon Go has fostered among consumers.

Free-to-play Business Model
 
The free-to-play business model for games was pioneered on the PC platform and has exploded globally on the mobile platform. The free-to-play model allows users to download and play an enjoyable, but limited, portion of a game for free. If the user wants to access premium features or special virtual items to increase the fun factor, then the user is required to pay, usually $0.99 per feature or item or $0.99 for a bundle of virtual items. For example, if a player has run out of “lives” or “moves” in a game, the player is given two options: 1) Wait for the lives to re-charge which involves waiting but no expense of money or virtual currency; 2) Spend money or virtual currency to buy additional “lives” and keep playing immediately. We use this business model in our Garfield Go game, where players can purchase additional food items to feed Garfield. In Munzee, players can purchase blast caps to capture virtual Munzees deployed near them. 
 
In a just a few years, the free-to-play business model has proven to be a very successful model for mobile games. The revenue potential of a game largely depends on the fun-factor and popularity of the game and the game creator’s proprietary techniques for encouraging the player to make a purchase decision – without overly offending the player. The potential for rapidly spreading the game through social networks and small in-game purchases can add up to a very sizeable business opportunity. One of the top grossing games since it was launched in 2012, owned and marketed by King Digital, one of our competitors, is called Candy Crush Saga, a seemingly simple game where a user combines 3 or more color candies on a puzzle board to get points. Think Gaming, a service that analyzes and consults to mobile “freemium” game makers, publishers and investors, estimates that Candy Crush Saga grossed over $425,000 per day in 2015, or over $150 million per year, with a lifetime user revenue of merely $3.00 from in-game purchases.

While the success of Candy Crush Saga illustrates the potential market of so called “free-to-play” games, we have no relationship with King Digital or any of its games, and cannot expect and cannot predict that any of our launched games or games in development can have anywhere close to the success of games of our competitors. We have historically been unable to break even, much less ever enjoyed success of a game that generates multi-millions of dollars in revenues. Nevertheless, our business model is to attempt to develop and launch successful games. However, there is no assurance we will ever be able to do so. 
 
Going forward, we plan on the majority of Freeze Tag’s mobile games to be based on the free-to-play model. In addition, we believe that games are more fun with friends, so we connect our players with major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to enhance the games’ addictiveness, enjoyment and world-of-mouth referrals. In executing our business model, we have previously employed a proprietary game engine and real-time data analytics to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. 
 
In the future, we plan to continue to employ our game engine, and where and when appropriate, we will develop specific games using the Unity Development platform. Unity (www.unity3d.com) has become the development platform of choice for many game studios, and allows us to quickly access additional talent in game development. We also plan to utilize other technologies in their native development environment (such as HTML5) as circumstances dictate. This shift will allow us to find the best development teams, engineering teams, and partners to help us quickly deploy our games.
 
Explosive Growth for Mobile Games
 
According to a 2016 report from Newzoo (a global market research firm with a primary focus on games), the global market for mobile games revenue will increase from $29.7 billion in 2015 to $58.1 billion in 2020, translating into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3%.

A Truly Global Market
 
The market for mobile applications grows as the number of smartphones and tablets increases. As of 2016, smartphone penetration reached 2.3 billion users or about 31% of the total global population. However, there is much room for growth. In 2016, almost half of the global users were found in the Asian Pacific region with other areas of the world such as Latin America and the Middle East/Africa set to record impressive growth, according to the Newzoo Mobile Games Report.

Popular Smartphone Devices
 
One of the key elements of the growth of mobile game applications is the growth and introduction of new smartphone devices. As evidenced by the chart below, in the USA, Apple and Samsung products dominate the market. It is important for app developers to be aware of the most popular devices to ensure that their applications are optimized for use in order to reach the majority of the consumers who own those devices.

The Female Player
 
The explosive growth of the mobile games market can be partly attributed to a relative increase in the number of female players. Gaming is historically a male dominated market with action-based games. But the modern female with disposable income, a smartphone and time on her hands has changed everything. This market development has opened the door wide for a previously niche category of games referred to as “casual” games. Candy Crush Saga is an example of a casual game, and clearly, this is no longer a niche category.
The Freeze Tag Strategy
 
In targeting the global market for mobile games, we are highly focused on developing mobile social games that are casual, fun and engaging for all ages and gender. The free-to-play business model combined with the use of best-in-class development environments (be it the Freeze Tag Game Engine, Unity3D, HTML/CSS/Javascript engines or other technology) and Analytics and Deployment tools, allows us to systematically launch, optimize and monetize our games. We design our games to be never ending entertainment that our users will enjoy playing and be willing to pay us $0.99 or more from time-to-time for special features and virtual items to keep having fun. We believe that the free-to-play model should not be run as a sprint but rather as a marathon. Over the span of several months, or even years, each game is continuously subject to this optimization process to increase user enjoyment and financial return to the company.

Distribution and Marketing
 
We market, sell and distribute our games primarily through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store and Amazon’s App Store. We also sell to our players directly through our own web site http://www.freezetag.com and http://store.freezetag.com. We work with payment vendors like Shopify, Square and PayPal to process our online payments. In addition to publishing our smartphone games on direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we also publish some of our titles on other platforms, such as the Facebook App Store, the Mac App Store and PC Download portals such as Big Fish Games and Gamehouse. 
User Acquisition 
 
In the free-to-play business model, a constant stream of new players is necessary to be successful. So, we have partnered with advertising networks and lead generation companies such as Facebook and Google to help us reach the appropriate audience for our products. We also employ data analytics to determine which creative messages and which lead referral sources are bringing in the most players who spend money in our games. 
 
To help reduce the cost of acquiring downloads, we have embedded social networking mechanisms into our games to enable our best customers to do the marketing for us. Every time a satisfied player invites her friend to play one of our games, we have been introduced to a new potential customer without incurring a cost to entice that player to download the game. We will continue to design methods to encourage our players to invite their friends and spread the word about our games. Each time a user downloads one of our games from a friend referral without a direct expense from us, our user acquisition cost is lower, and therefore our profitability is potentially higher. 
 
Technology and Tools
 
Free-to-play Revenue Model
 
The game industry, like many other forms of entertainment (music, TV, books, etc.) is undergoing a major shift. The free-to-play business model increased in appeal to game players of every genre and platform. Nowhere has this been felt more deeply than the mobile market. Free is a very powerful marketing approach that is irresistible to game players. The top grossing charts on popular mobile app stores like Apple, Google, and Amazon continually show that “free” games earn the most revenue for their developers. So with all this “free-ness,” how does a game creator make any money?
Optimizing Customer Lifetime Value
 
The key business metric of any free-to-play game is the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). A free-to-play gamer starts out as a zero revenue customer, but he or she may become a paying customer throughout the customer’s life of playing the game. The game creator’s business is an ongoing engagement with the game players to get them to buy things in the game, without ruining the fun. Optimizing this delicate balance is where the most revenue can be extracted.

The following graphic, developed by XEODesign identifies the approach to creating free-to-play games that are fun and engaging to consumers.
 

There are many techniques for generating free-to-play revenue. They range from a simple static “pay to access more levels” model to a more dynamic model where player behaviors are systematically analyzed to strategically introduce purchase options to help the user enjoy more of the game. Freeze Tag dynamically optimizes a game’s CLV by integrating two important elements: (1) Data Analytics and (2) a Dynamic Game Engine (whether it be the Freeze Tag Game Engine, Unity3D, or other native development environment).
 


10

 
This combination allows us to optimize the features of our games to refresh and update the content so that players are happily engaged and invite their friends to play with them. When players invite their friends, they lower our user acquisition costs. The longer and more often players come back to play, the more likely they are to spend money on virtual goods (through in-game purchases). The net result is a customer with a greater lifetime value. The happier customers are, the more they share with their friends and the more often they come back to spend money. Everything we do is geared to our players having more fun because ultimately customer fun translates into revenue.
 
Data Analytics
 
By using commercial and proprietary data analytics tools, we analyze various aspects of the game across the entire pool of players to determine what modifications can be made to the game, which allows us to: (1) make it more fun, and (2) induce a purchase.
 
Some of the analysis we perform regularly are:
 


· | Analyze the number of users that complete the tutorial process 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Identify the Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 retention metrics of how many players are returning to play 
· | Quantify the ARPDAU (average revenue per daily active user) to determine the monetization effectiveness of each game 
· | Determine the percentage of overall users that are converting to spenders 
· | Quantify the ARPPDAU (average revenue per paying daily active user) 
· | Determine what parts of the game users are playing most 
· | Identify where in the game users are dropping out, and find out why 
· | Average play time per day and per session 
· | Importance of social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, to the game and how many players login to social networks 
· | Frequency of users playing against friends 
· | Identify what events most correlate with purchase events 
· | Identify how many invites a user is sending out, how long it takes them to send the first invite out, and how many of those players are coming in.

Dynamic Game Engine(s)
 
Over the years, we have developed a proprietary dynamic game engine (Freeze Tag Engine) that allows us to make changes to game play and game economies on-the-fly, in most cases, without requiring the download of another update. We also integrate several business analytics packages, and other key game management tools into our games that provide us with real time data to measure detailed player behavior, and respond directly to that behavior. Starting in 2014 and continuing forward, we began using the Unity3D Development Engine (www.unity3d.com). We have optimized and are continuing to optimize this engine in many of the same ways that our own engine was optimized. However, we continue to develop our own game engine which uses web-friendly technology that can be easily ported to the most popular mobile platforms, iOS and Android. As our games have become more sophisticated with the need for constant data connection and several points of data required to be associated with physical locations on a map, we have developed server-side tools to handle these requirements. 
Platform Portability - Dynamic Game Engine(s)
 
Over the years, the Freeze Tag Game Engine has allowed us to the ability to port across multiple platforms using a single codebase. We continue to look to contract with outside teams and outside contractors, allowing us to maintain a smaller internal team. 

11

 
As we continue our development efforts in 2018, our approach is to review the technical requirements of the game we want to develop, then make a decision as to which Game Engine is the most appropriate to implement for that development effort, whether that be our own proprietary game engine based on web technologies or third party platforms such as Unity 3D. 
 
As we make decisions about which Game Engine to employ, here are a few of the things that we look to have:
 


· | A single codebase that can be easily ported to other platforms 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Ability to “bolt on” other technologies and codes to easily integrate with other SDK’s, platforms and special needs
· | Interface easily with scalable backend databases and architecture 
· | Easily localized into new languages 
· | Updates can be pushed to the game allowing us to change things like: 


○ | adding new characters 
--+---------------------------------------------
○ | changing the values in the economy 
○ | updating text 
○ | messaging users (in game) about new features
○ | instigating a social network based contest 

Integrated Feedback Mechanisms
 
In addition, we aim to integrate feedback mechanisms into our games to provide incentive for our players to communicate their favorite features and any technical difficulties they may be experiencing. By combining dynamic gaming technology and data analytics into one integrated business process, we can optimize the “fun” factor for our players and maximize our revenue potential.
Product Development
 
We have learned that establishing and following a fairly rigid process is essential to producing commercially successful products, regardless of the platform. The process all begins with the creative development process. The chart below describes the approach we use to filter ideas and make final decisions on which games we will actually produce. After choosing the game that we will focus on, we write a detailed design document. A thorough design document ensures that all of those involved in the creation of the game have a common reference source throughout the production process. Also critical to producing high quality games, a test plan accompanies every design document. Not only do we test for bugs, but also we test the game for usability. Since most casual gamers do not want to read instructions, it is critical that the finished game be easy to play by just tapping at objects on the screen. 

12

 


As a developer of mobile social games, we have developed expertise in three core aspects of game production. These core competencies help to give us a competitive advantage in the industry. They are listed below, with the resulting benefit also identified.
 


1. | Create High Quality Products (including art and sound assets). Benefit: Provides high value to distribution partners and consumers, resulting in increased downloads and purchases. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Maintain Flexible Engineering Tools and Processes. Benefit: Decreases time-to-market delivery of products. 
3. | Minimize Risk by doing the following: 1) selecting proven genres, 2) keeping development costs low, and 3) modifying designs “on the fly” based on consumer feedback. Benefit: Increases the number of games released per year and decreases reliance on any one title’s success, ultimately improving return on investment for each game.

Augmented Reality and Geolocation Games Development
 
In 2016, Freeze Tag’s development team began working on a series of augmented reality/geolocation products designed to address this growing market. We signed a licensing agreement with the experienced geolocation application company Munzee (http://frzt.us/2mkXT95). We liked working with the Munzee team so much that we decided to combine forces and merge our operations in October 2017. We continue to work on augmented reality and location based games for the future. 
Competition
 
The business of mobile games is very competitive. New products are introduced frequently and the platforms and devices change rapidly. To be successful in this crowded marketplace, we have to entice consumers to play our games based on the quality and “fun” of the experience. Players evaluate our games based on the game play, graphics quality, the music and sound effects and the efficiency and clarity of our software engineering and user interface design. 
 
We compete with a continually increasing number of successful location based mobile game companies, including Niantic (makers of Pokemon Go), Geocaching, Seek, Snatch and many others. 
 
In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for mobile devices, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. As evidenced by the recent Flappy Bird phenomenon, it is possible for a one-man development team to build and launch a game that is able to achieve millions of downloads. 
 
Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:
 


· | significantly greater financial resources; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | greater experience with the free-to-play games and games-as-a-service (GAAS) business models and more effective game monetization; 
· | stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide; 
· | greater experience and effectiveness integrating community features into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users; 
· | larger installed customer bases from their existing mobile games; 
· | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products; 
· | larger installed customer bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;
· | more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties; 
· | better overall economies of scale; 
· | greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and 
· | broader global distribution and presence. 


13

Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We use a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have also registered a number of domain names, which we believe will be important to the branding and success of our games. Our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own or license. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. 
 
We intend to register ownership of software copyrights in the United States as well as seek registration of various trademarks associated with the Company’s name and mobile social games that we will develop. 
 
Wherever possible, we own registered trademark protection for properties we develop. As the digital markets evolve, there are and will continue to be many competitors who will imitate successful game properties. We are investing in trademark protection to create game brands and protect them. For example, we have received approval from the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register Party Animals®, Unsolved Mystery®, Unsolved Mystery Club®, Ancient Astronauts®, Victorian Mysteries®, Grimm Reaper® and Rocket Weasel® for all gaming platforms. Munzee Inc. has previously received approval for the trademarks Munzee®, Eventzee®, and WallaBee®. These marks will assist us in defending against copycats who may try to incorporate these terms into their game titles. 
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot be assured that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party.
 
Garfield Licensing Relationship
 
In October of 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with one of the most well-known comic character brands in the world, Garfield the cat. Paws Inc. is the licensing company that administers and represents the intellectual property rights of Garfield, Odie, Jon, and all of the characters in the Garfield comics universe. Our non-exclusive agreement (http://frzt.us/2nmY31o) gives us the ability to include the Garfield characters in our games in exchange for a share of the revenue we generate in those specific games. By the end of 2016, we had launched two games that featured Garfield, Kitty Pawp Featuring Garfield and Garfield Trivia. In June of 2017, we launched our first augmented reality game featuring Garfield called Garfield Go. 
 
Business Acquisitions 
 
In addition to our current operations, we propose to seek, investigate and, if warranted, acquire an interest in one or more businesses. The merger with Munzee Inc. is evidence of our pursuit of this strategy. We propose to investigate potential opportunities, particularly focusing upon existing privately held businesses whose owners are willing to consider merging their businesses into our company in order to establish a public trading market for their common stock, and whose managements are willing to operate the acquired businesses as divisions or subsidiaries of our company. The businesses we acquire may or may not need an injection of cash to facilitate their future operations. Presently, if we acquire any businesses we envision such acquisition being completed either with our shares of our stock or with the assistance of a strategic funding partner. We currently do not have substantial funds, or a revenue stream, to make acquisitions utilizing cash.
 
We are primarily interested in other technology opportunities, but we currently do not intend to restrict our search for investment opportunities to any particular industry or geographical location and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business. Our executive officers will review material furnished to them by the proposed merger or acquisition candidates and will ultimately decide if a merger or acquisition is in our best interests and the interests of our shareholders. We intend to source business opportunities through our officers and directors and their contacts. Those contacts include professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities and ventures may become available to it due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) management’s willingness to consider a wide variety of businesses; (2) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (3) our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities and ventures, we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by our management, such potential business opportunities or ventures by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.
 


14

 
In a so-called “due diligence investigation”, we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our officers or agents to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding our prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target business to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise. 
 
Government Regulation
 
Because of our recent partnership with Paws Inc. (Garfield license), and our development of Augmented Reality / Geolocation games, and the types of data that we collect in those games, we must be more mindful of government regulations regarding the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA. To protect minors on the Internet (and now mobile devices), U.S. officials passed The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Essentially, COPPA governs online data collection of people aged 13 and younger. The COPPA rules define privacy policy requirements, data collection parameters, and the process of acquiring verifiable parental consent. In the past, we have disclosed the information that we collect in Privacy Policies, but now need to focus on getting parental approval for certain types of applications as they relate to children under the age of 13.
Our Employees
 
We have 16 employees and 7 contractors (23 total), that work in our offices in Tustin, California, McKinney, Texas, and other remote locations throughout the world. 5 of these are managers, 3 are administrative staff, and the remaining 15 are artists, engineers, production staff, etc. We also work with other artists, engineers, designers, and contractors on and as-needed basis. 
Description of Property
 
Our executive offices are located in Tustin, California, at 18062 Irvine Blvd, Suite 103, Tustin, CA 92780 and are leased on a month-to-month basis at a cost of $977 per month. Our production office in Texas is located at 1720 Bray Central Drive, McKinney, TX 75069 and we are currently at the end of the first year of a 3 year lease. Current monthly lease payment for 15,000 sq feet of space is $15,000 per month plus utilities, and we anticipate that will soon be reduced significantly as we move into a smaller space within the same office complex.
