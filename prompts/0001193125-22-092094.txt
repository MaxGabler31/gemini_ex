 DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS 
 The Company is a consumer-focused cannabis company based in the United States focused on the recreational and wellness markets. The Company’s high quality integrated seed-to-sale operations in California are focused on building winning brands supported by its direct-to-consumer ecosystem. The Company’s platform was designed to create the most socially responsible and culturally impactful company in the United States, producing consistent, well-priced products and culturally relevant brands that are distributed to third-party retailers as well as direct-to-consumer via the Company’s delivery service and strategically located storefront retail locations across California. A full portfolio of products and brands that appeals to a broad range of user groups, need-states and occasions, offered at all price points, and with unique brand value propositions, are produced at low cost and high caliber of quality through integrated cultivation and manufacturing. The Company believes its wholly-owned delivery and storefront retail outlets will allow it to achieve high gross-margins on many of its products, forge one-on-one relationships between its brands and consumers and collect proprietary consumer data and insights. 
 While the Company is focused on the recreational and wellness markets, a small portion (estimated to be less than 1%) of its revenues is derived from cannabis and products containing cannabis used by medical cannabis patients in accordance with applicable state law, but for which no drug approval has been granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (where use may include inhalation, consumption, or application). 
 The Company’s operational footprint spans cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, distribution, brands, retail and delivery. The management team and directors of the Company bring together deep expertise in cannabis, consumer packaged goods, investing and finance from start-ups to publicly traded companies. The Company aims to leverage its collective industry experience to ensure a highly synergistic and strategic transaction is executed. 
 At December 31, 2021, the Company viewed its business as having the following two sales channels: 
 

1) | Direct to Consumer (in-store retail, pick up and delivery): the Company currently operates eleven omni channel retail locations, three in Northern California, three in Central California, and five in Southern California along with six delivery hubs (including the Coastal Holding Company, LLC acquisition as described in this 10-K).
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Wholesale: the Company sells first-party and selected third-party products into 450 dispensaries across California. Additional wholesale revenue comes from sales of sourced bulk flower and oil produced in house.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5 

  Revenues from these sales channels are as follows: 
 

 | Year endedDecember 31, 2021 | 
Direct to consumer | $ | 54,238,607 
Wholesale | | 119,176,274
 | $ | 173,414,881


As the Company continues to scale and integrate its business it is incurring operating losses. Its operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $818,518,013, (including impairment losses of $654,317,300) and $8,813,918 respectively. The Company is focused on reducing operating losses as it scales and integrates its businesses. 
 Through a combination of professional leadership, technology and data driven practices, brand and product expertise, as well as social justice and equity advocacy, the Company intends to set the example globally as a best-in-class cannabis operation. In addition, the Company plans to pursue an opportunistic M&A strategy to accelerate growth, market share gains and profitability. 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 1, 2021, the Company entered into definitive agreements (the “Coastal Agreements”) to acquire 100% of the equity securities of Coastal Holding Company, LLC (“Coastal”), a California retail dispensary and delivery operator, for aggregate consideration, subject to adjustments, of up to US$56.2 million (the “Coastal Transaction”), comprised of up to (i) US$16.2 million in cash, (ii) US$20 million in Common Shares, the issuance of which is contingent upon the signing of management services agreements (“Coastal MSAs”) at each Coastal location and (iii) US$20 million in Common Shares, the issuance of which is contingent upon the successful transfer of Coastal’s cannabis licenses. The Company entered into Coastal MSAs related to six of Coastal’s dispensaries/deliver locations concurrently with the signing of the Coastal Agreements and is in the process of obtaining approval for two additional MSAs, which are subject to regulatory review by the applicable local municipalities. The US$16.2 million cash portion of the consideration was paid to Coastal at signing and is secured by a promissory note forgivable upon Coastal satisfying certain closing conditions. The price of the Common Shares forming a portion of the consideration will be determined based on the market price of the Common Shares on the dates such MSAs are executed or regulatory approval milestones are achieved before closing (each, a “Pricing Date”). Common Shares issued in connection with the Transaction will be subject to lock-up provisions that will release upon the later of (i) six months from the applicable Pricing Date; and (ii) satisfaction of certain closing conditions. 
 Coastal is a retail dispensary license holder and operator with six retail licensed locations, five of which are currently operating, and two delivery depots. Coastal’s operating dispensaries are located in Santa Barbara, Pasadena, West Los Angeles, Stockton and Vallejo. Coastal is also engaged in the construction of another retail license location in Northern California and operating delivery depots in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. Coastal serves over 1,000 people per day, in their stores and online. 
 As part of the Coastal Transaction the Company will also inherit a minority stake in a southern California dispensary and an option to purchase the remainder of that dispensary for US$9 million in cash (the “Coastal Option”). The Coastal Option may be exercised by the Company following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. US$4.5 million of the exercise price of the Coastal Option was prepaid upon execution of the Coastal Agreements. 
 Taking into account retail locations and delivery depots operated pursuant to MSAs, the Company’s currently operates 11 retail stores and six delivery depots footprints. Upon completion, the acquisition of Coastal is expected to result in the Company having the capacity to reach over 80% of California’s population. The Coastal Transaction is expected to legally close in 2022, subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including approval of the Exchange. 
 In addition to the Coastal Transaction, on October 1, 2021, the Company closed the first tranche of the previously announced acquisition of the Calma dispensary, located in West Hollywood, with the acquisition of 85% of Calma’s equity securities. The transfer of the remaining 15% equity of Calma is expected to occur in 2022. 
 Cultivation 
 The Company operates over 35,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space producing premium flower for product lines on the higher-end of the price spectrum – Monogram, Caliva and others, as well as potential new brands developed in-house, new brands developed as part of the transactions contemplated by the Brand Strategy Agreement, and new brands that will come into the portfolio via future acquisitions. The Company has a procurement network of over 500 cultivators throughout California to purchase everything from low-cost outdoor, high-quality mid-priced greenhouse, and premium indoor flower as required by its portfolio of brands.

  On May 16, 2021, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the “Membership Interest Purchase Agreement”) to obtain leasehold interests of approximately 10 years duration in each of four one-acre parcels of land that are licensed for outdoor cannabis grow (collectively, the “Outdoor Grow Properties”). On May 21, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into series of cultivation and supply agreements with each of the leaseholders of the Outdoor Grow Properties and Mosaic. AG, Inc. (“Mosaic.Ag”), pursuant to which Mosaic.Ag agreed to cultivate cannabis on each of the Outdoor Grow Properties on the Company’s behalf for a period commencing on the Effective Date of and ending at least three years from the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, with options to extend for up to five years (the “Cultivation and Supply Agreements”). Under the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, as of the Effective Date, the Company and Mosaic.Ag obtained access to the Outdoor Grow Properties and began to commence cannabis cultivation activities under the Cultivation and Supply Agreements. The purchase price under the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement is $6,000,000 in cash, $2,500,000 in Common Shares payable on the closing date (with the number of shares issued based on the volume-weighted average price per Common Share for the ten consecutive trading days prior to the closing date) and up to 1,309,263 shares subject to an earnout based on the production value of cannabis grown on the Outdoor Grow Properties over the twenty-four months following the Effective Date. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement are dependent on the satisfaction of various closing conditions, which have not been met to date and are not expected to be met by the end of the second quarter of 2022 as required by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. Further, Mosaic.Ag was unable to produce sufficient quantities of biomass according to Company quality standards and pursuant to the Cultivation Supply Agreements. For the foregoing reasons, the parties are currently in dialogue and may restructure the transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, on the Effective Date, the Company advanced to the seller $5,650,000 secured by a promissory note. In the event that the transaction does not close, the promissory note is contractually obligated to be repaid to the Company. The transactions contemplated by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement and the Cultivation and Supply Agreements are collectively referred to in this Annual Report as the “Mosaic.Ag Transaction”). 
 The Company both purchases and sells flower. California’s price compression on bulk and wholesale flower continued in the fourth quarter of 2021. According to Cannabis Benchmarks, the pricing of indoor flower, which is the principal product the Company sells at wholesale, dropped approximately 9% from October 15, 2021 to December 17, 2021. 
 Extraction 
 The Company operates two extraction facilities in the Eureka/Arcata area with Type-6 extraction licenses that are currently capable of producing 3,400 kg of crude and 2,700 kg of distillate per month. Distillate is a refined product from crude. Crude is a full-spectrum oil that contains all the cannabinoids, terpenes and other constituents extracted from the plant. Distillate is a pure THC product, produced by refining the crude and removing the terpenes and other constituents to isolate only the THC. This extraction capacity is utilized for both the production and sale of bulk crude and distillate as well as the production of the Company’s finished goods in the vaporizer and ingestible categories. The Company estimates its extraction business supplies approximately 20% of the distillate sold legally in California. Extraction (oil) markets are also subject to price fluctuations based on pricing of cultivation, which serves as the input material for extraction process. As cultivation pricing drops, pricing of oil from extraction also decreases. Pricing swings have the greatest effect on sales of bulk oil. 
Manufacturing 
 The Company operates three cannabis manufacturing facilities with a total footprint of 20,500 licensed square feet throughout the State of California that are currently producing many form-factors, including jarred and bagged whole flower, pre-rolls, bulk extracts, vape cartridges, ready-to-use vapes, gummies, chocolate and capsules. The Company’s estimates that its manufacturing facilities have the operating capacity to meet 20% of California market demand for distillate cannabis oil. These facilities enable the Company to produce a wide range of form-factors for a wide range of differentiated brands, addressing all consumer groups, needs occasions and price points. Having diverse manufacturing capabilities supports a broad range of product and brand strategies including the Company’s relationships with JAY-Z and Roc Nation. 
 Quality Testing 
 Prior to release to the commercial market, each batch of packaged cannabis biomass and/or manufactured cannabis products (collectively “cannabis goods”) must have a batch-specific Certificate of Analysis (“COA”) from a testing laboratory (“lab”). Labs are independent, third-party entities licensed by the California’s Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). A COA is a legally binding document created by the lab that shows the analytical quality test results of each batch of cannabis goods indicating whether the batch is safe for human consumption. Upon issuance, COAs are uploaded by the lab into the State’s track-and-trace system, METRC, for version control and may not be amended. As reflected on each COA, a lab tests each batch of cannabis goods for

  cannabinoid content, presence of foreign materials, heavy metals, microbial impurities, mycotoxins, moisture content and water activity, residual pesticides, and residual solvents and processing chemicals. State regulations stipulate “passing” and “failing” criteria within each of the elements tested and indicated on the COA. 
 In compliance with applicable regulations, the Company must allow a lab to enter its licensed premises to conduct batch-sampling of cannabis goods. The lab removes a representative sample of each batch of cannabis goods to quality test the elements listed above. Once a representative sample of a batch of cannabis goods is submitted for COA testing, the Company cannot conduct any further manufacturing, packaging, or other activity that may impact the quality, form, or purity of the overall batch. Batches that receive a “failing” COA must be remediated or destroyed in compliance with applicable regulations. Batches that receive a “passing” COA are cleared for entry into the commercial market. 
 Brands 
 The Company has a portfolio of over eight owned and licensed brands offering over 250 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) covering key consumer form-factors such as whole flower, pre-rolls, infused pre-rolls, vaporizer cartridges in both distillate and live resin format, concentrates, gummies, chocolate and capsules, tinctures and topicals. The Company strives to produce high quality products and brands that appeal to both new and experienced cannabis users – such as the High Times Cup-winning Caliva brand of flower. Monogram, a brand developed in partnership with JAY-Z, was announced in October 2020 and addresses the ultra-premium price point for flower and pre-rolls.
The Company’s brand portfolio addresses a wide range of consumers, need-states and occasions with its variety of brands and form-factors, and we believe there are additional opportunities to expand the portfolio through innovation, partnerships and acquisitions. The Company has appointed JAY-Z, a leading voice in music, culture, entertainment, and business, as its Chief Visionary Officer to oversee the development and promotion of brands that leverage the vision, influence, and social impact mission of the Company. Amidst challenging marketing restrictions in cannabis that bar brands from leveraging traditional advertising and media channels, the brands developed in collaboration with JAY-Z and Roc Nation are expected to benefit from the significant consumer following and influence of JAY-Z and Roc Nation. The Company’s work with JAY-Z will initially focus on products sold at a premium price point but will not be restricted to that price point. 
 Distribution 
 The Company’s distribution footprint is comprised of two distribution hubs located in California. From these hubs, the Company currently sells 1st party and 3rd party product into 450 dispensaries across California. The Company anticipates its number of active dispensary accounts to increase as the number of operating dispensaries in the state continues to grow. 
Delivery 
 The Company offers direct-to-consumer delivery of owned brands as well as third-party brands out eight locations; three in Southern California, three in Central California and two in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Company operates its own delivery depots and directly employs its delivery drivers. The Company estimates that its direct-to-consumer delivery is able to reach approximately 80% of Californians when including the Coastal transaction. The Company’s delivery business is subject to state regulatory changes, including as to case pack limits relating to how much product that drivers can carry at one time. 
 The Company’s direct-to-consumer offerings include an integrated e-commerce platform offering in-store pickup, curbside pick-up, express delivery, and scheduled delivery, allowing the Company to extend its reach beyond physical retail locations and expand interactions with its customers, while beating the illicit market on convenience and safety. The omni channel e-commerce platform generates proprietary consumer data which informs product and brand development, corporate development, distribution and personalization. The Company leverages this consumer data and data-driven inventory management practices to refine its menu and inventory management, including offering a menu that is dynamic based on user location. Offering direct-to-consumer delivery allows consumers to access the Company’s selection of owned and third-party brands conveniently across a significant portion of Northern, Central and Southern California. The Company strives to prioritize the merchandising and maximize sales of its own portfolio of brands and products on the delivery platform as a means of maximizing overall gross margins. The Company expects a significant portion of delivery sales to be of owned brands, in addition to planned product innovations, consisting of many form-factors across multiple price points that address a wide variety of consumer segments and occasions. The Company will leverage a mix of express and scheduled delivery offerings as a means to maximize the value of product delivered per driver shift and minimize the overall cost-per-delivery.

  Retail 
 After signing the Coastal transaction, the Company operates eleven retail dispensaries strategically located across the state of California. These retail locations offer consumers a wide variety of owned and third-party brands and products via walk-in, in-store pick-up, and curbside pick-up. The Company plans to add additional retail locations both organically and through acquisition. For example, on October 1, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of Calma West Hollywood (“Calma”), an operating dispensary located in West Hollywood, California, for a total consideration of $11,500,000, consisting of $8,500,000 in cash and $3,000,000 of in Common Shares (the “Calma Agreement”). On October 1, 2021, the Company closed the first tranche under the Calma Agreement, with the acquisition of 85% of Calma’s equity securities. The transfer of the remaining 15% equity of Calma is expected to occur in 2022. In accordance with the agreement, the Company transferred $1,500,000 in cash into escrow, which will be released to the Company when the remaining 15% is acquired and the Company issues the related common shares to the seller. The Company strives to prioritize the merchandising and maximize sales of its own portfolio of brands and products in retail as a means of maximizing overall gross margins. The Company expects a significant portion of retail sales to be of owned brands, in addition to planned product innovations, consisting of many form-factors across multiple price points that address a wide variety of consumer segments, need-states and occasions. 
 In addition, pursuant to the Coastal MSAs, the Company operates five additional retail locations in Santa Barbara, Pasadena, West Los Angeles, Stockton and Vallejo. 
 E-Commerce
The Company’s e-commerce offerings are centered on Caliva.com, a centralized user-centric e-commerce platform. In addition to accessing online pickup and delivery of our products through Caliva.com, customers can access online pickup and delivery through the Caliva App in Apple’s App Store. This is a differentiated online platform in cannabis, an industry in which most shopping interactions occur in simple brick-and-mortar retail environments. This platform facilitates seamless orders for in-store or curbside pickup at our retail locations, as well as for delivery to our customers throughout the delivery radius of the Company’s delivery depots, which covers approximately 80% of the adult population in California when including Coastal assets. 
 The Company’s e-commerce platform offers a wide range of both owned brands and products as well as third-party brands and products. Owned brands and products are prioritized in merchandising and therefore it is anticipated they will make up a substantial portion of total sales, resulting in increased profit margins. The Company’s e-commerce platform also enables it to use consumer data to drive personalization and product recommendations to customers, thereby encouraging loyalty and re-orders.
Integration 
 The Parent Company’s operational footprint spans cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, distribution, brands, retail and delivery. Our three manufacturing facilities combined with our distribution footprint of strategically-placed distribution hubs delivering to over 450 dispensaries, support the growth of our diverse and growing portfolio of owned brands, with the ability to fulfill most dispensary orders within 72 hours. Our direct-to-consumer delivery reaches approximately 80% of the adult population in California when including Coastal assets.

These controls are supported by professionally certified on-site security personnel in certain instances. 
 Inventory: The Company maintains inventory control and reporting systems that document the present location, amount, and a description of all cannabis and cannabis products at all facilities. The traceability of cannabis goods is maintained using the California’s “Track-and-Trace” system, METRC, and the Company’s integrated enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”). The Company conducts regular continuous cycle counts in addition to both quarterly and annual manual inventory reconciliations, in accordance with regulations and best practices. 
 Operational Compliance 
 Internal audits are conducted quarterly in the normal course. These audits allow us to identify and monitor the Company’s strengths and weaknesses, highlighting continuous opportunities for improvement. These internal audits also provide us an opportunity to reinforce best practices and to institute changes in areas that are identified as opportunities for improvement. The information discovered and obtained during these internal audits is used to improve the compliance programs, when necessary, by revising policies, strengthening training, and establishing better reporting processes. The focus of the Company’s internal compliance audit is to ensure it is compliant with both state and local laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures. Internal audits may be delayed or completed remotely by video from time to time as a result of COVID-19 precautions.

  Big Data Analysis 
 The Company has invested in a highly scalable data architecture and platform built using leading technologies and tools. By extracting data from its ERP software and the California METRC track and trace system and subsequently organizing it in its data warehouse, the Company has enabled critical data and insights for its compliance efforts. The Company’s data warehouse secures and stores all data and transactions at frequent intervals, allowing extensive access and analysis to information that is current. The Company has the ability to understand precise movement of inventory or dollars, past or present, required for review or due diligence as related to compliance requirements or inquiries. The Company is using this data infrastructure proactively to track, monitor and reconcile inventory levels and for ongoing reconciliation with METRC. 
Ongoing Compliance 
 The Company prides itself on a robust internal compliance program encompassing both the compliance measures described above as well as monitoring compliance with U.S. state law on an ongoing basis. Key to those compliance efforts is the employment of individuals dedicated to monitoring California law for changes and updates to statutes and regulations, both at the state level and the local level, that impact business operations. Currently, the Company employs six individuals whose job function includes some aspect of compliance. Further, the Company employs a government relations employee whose primary job function is to monitor the changing landscape of state and local law while employing an external consultant and two external law firms that assist in the monitoring, notification, and interpretation of any changes. Additionally, the Company currently implements and maintains standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) that are designed for monitoring compliance with California law on an ongoing basis. These SOPs include ongoing review of current and anticipated statutes, regulations, and ordinances and the training of employees to maintain compliance with California law. 
 In addition to the internal compliance team and the consultants and law firms described above, the Company also engages local regulatory compliance counsel and consultants in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Such counsel regularly provides legal advice to the Company regarding compliance with state and local laws and regulation and the Company’s legal and compliance exposures under United States federal law. 
 Social Equity 
 The Company believes in the paramount importance of promoting social equity in the cannabis industry as a core part of its business operations. As such, concurrent with the closing of the Qualifying Transaction, the Company launched a new social equity fund focused on investing in Black and other people-of-color cannabis entrepreneurs. The social equity venture fund identifies, conducts diligence on, and invests in such entrepreneurs as a means of directly impacting the issues of social equity and diversity in the cannabis industry. The social equity venture fund was initially seeded with $10,000,000 from the Company’s balance sheet, with a planned annual contribution of at least 2% of the Company’s net income. The social equity venture fund invests as a wholly integrated division of the Company under management of employees of the Company. The social equity fund, where possible, will leverage existing social equity programs as well as not-for-profit organizations engaged in social equity license application support, entrepreneur mentorship, workforce development, and entrepreneurial community-building. On May 27, 2021, the Company created a Social Equity Advisory Committee comprised of thought leaders across cannabis, civil rights activism, criminal justice reform, policy advocacy and impact investing. Subsequently, the Company announced its first two investments from the social equity fund being Stanton Brands (dba Josephine & Billie’s) and Peakz LLC. 
Intellectual Property 
 As part of the Company’s brand strategy, it strives to protect its proprietary products and brand elements and its brand. Intellectual property (“IP”) protection is pursued both in its ability to sell products and brands through first “Freedom to Operate” searches and subsequently, reviewing proprietary and protectable claims, branding, technology, or design assets. The Company evaluates opportunities for IP protection from cultivation and strain development, in manufacturing and processes, and for its portfolio of finished goods. The Company’s IP protection ranges from trademarks to patents to trade secrets and covers anything from cultivation, genetics, product development, packaging development, claims, operations, information technology, and branding. Additionally, the Company from time to time partners with other companies and pursues further IP protection through licensing and collaboration with those partners. 
 The Company seeks to protect its proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with third parties and partners and non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with its employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect its proprietary information and ensure ownership of technologies that are developed through its relationship with the respective counterparty. The Company cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford it adequate protection of its intellectual property and proprietary information rights. 
 The Company has at least six registered federal trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and 38 California state trademark registrations. In addition, the Company has at least 56 federal trademark applications and one New York state application 
 
11 

  pending. The Company owns several trademarks in connection with its branded products and its retail, direct-to-consumer business, including branded dispensaries and its branded commerce website and mobile app. Specifically, the Company considers Monogram, Caliva, Deli, Deli by Caliva, and Fun Uncle to comprise its core products and services trademark portfolio, and each of these marks is subject to issued registrations or pending applications both federally and in California, and the Company will promptly file for registration of such marks in additional states as the Company’s business expands to such states. The federal illegality of cannabis currently prevents the Company from obtaining federal trademark registrations covering cannabis-touching goods or services, which means the Company must rely on state registrations, common law uses, and federal registrations for ancillary, non-cannabis goods and services, a reliance that has been validated by U.S. Courts in trademark cases between cannabis companies (none of which the Company has been a party to). The risk remains that a third party may adopt one of the Company’s trademarks in a different territory where the Company has made no use of the trademark, and therefore potentially has limited common law or state rights to protect the mark. 
 Competitive Conditions 
 As the Company is integrated it competes on multiple fronts, from manufacturing to retail to delivery, and experiences competition in each of these areas. The Company competes on the basis of the price, the quality of its products and its omni channel direct to consumer platform. From a retail perspective, the Company competes with other licensed retailers and delivery companies in the geographies where retail and delivery services are located. These other retailers range from small local operators to more significant operators with a presence throughout the State of California and other states in the United States. From a product perspective, the Company competes with other manufactures of brands for shelf space in third-party owned dispensaries throughout California. Similar to certain competitors in the retail space, the Company competes with manufacturers ranging in size from small local operators to significant operators with a larger presence. Indirectly, the Company competes with the illicit market, including many illegal dispensaries that continue to exist in the state of California. 
 The Company’s platform has been designed with the intention to combine leading operations across the supply chain with a scalable omni channel e-commerce platform to create a large and scalable integrated platforms in the single largest market, California. The Company believes there may be strategic opportunities to leverage its omnichannel platform and balance sheet to further expand its market share and accelerate profitability in California through mergers and acquisitions. 
 Specialized Knowledge, Skills, Resources & Equipment 
 Knowledge with respect to cultivating and growing cannabis is important in the cannabis industry. The nature of growing cannabis is not substantially different from the nature of growing other agricultural products. Variables such as temperature, humidity, lighting, air flow, watering and feeding cycles are meticulously defined and controlled to produce consistent product and to avoid contamination. 
 The Company grows or procures the primary component of its finished products, namely cannabis. The Company’s cultivation operations are dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to its growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other utilities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors –Risks Related to the Company’s Products and Services – The Company is reliant on key inputs”. 
 Staff with suitable horticultural and quality assurance expertise are generally available on the open market. The Company also requires client care staff, which will grow as its business grows. Customer care staff are also generally available on the open market. 
 Equipment used is specialized but is readily available and not specific to the cultivation of cannabis. Subject to available funding, the Company does not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining equipment. 
 The Company anticipates an increased demand for skilled manpower, energy resources and equipment in connection with the Company’s expected continued growth. 
 The Company anticipates an increased demand for skilled manpower, energy resources and equipment in connection with the Company’s expected continued growth. Because of this anticipation, the Company has entered into a series of arrangements to obtain the rights to four acres of land that is licensed for outdoor grow (“Mosaic.Ag”). In addition, the Company entered into a cultivation and supply agreement with a cultivator to cultivate cannabis on its behalf for a period of at least three years, with options to extend up to five years. The purchase price for Mosaic.Ag is $6,000,000 in cash, $2,500,000 in Common Shares when the transaction closes and up to 1,309,263 Common Shares subject to earnouts. The upfront payment of $5,650,000, net of holdbacks of $350,000, is secured by a promissory note. The closing of the transaction is dependent on the satisfaction of various closing conditions, which have not been met to date and are not expected to be met by the end of the second quarter of 2022 as required by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. Further, Mosaic.Ag was unable to produce sufficient quantities of biomass according to Company quality standards and pursuant to the Cultivation Supply Agreements.    For the foregoing reasons, the parties are currently in dialogue and may restructure the transaction. In the event that the transaction does not close, the promissory note is contractually obligated to be repaid to the Company.

  UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 Cannabis Industry Regulation 
 On February 8, 2018, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised their previously released Staff Notice 51-352 – Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (“Staff Notice 51-352”), which provides specific disclosure expectations for issuers that currently have, or are in the process of developing, cannabis-related activities in the United States as permitted within a particular state’s regulatory framework. All issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities are expected to clearly and prominently disclose certain prescribed information in prospectus filings and other required disclosure documents. As a result of the Company’s existing operations in California, the Company is providing the following disclosure pursuant to Staff Notice 51-352.
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from state legalized: (i) cannabis, and products containing cannabis, used by someone 21 or older that is not a medical cannabis patient (where use may include inhalation, consumption, or application) (“Adult-Use Cannabis”) and (ii) to a lesser extent, cannabis and products containing cannabis used by medical cannabis patients in accordance with applicable state law, but for which no drug approval has been granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (where use may include inhalation, consumption, or application) (“Medical-Use Cannabis”) ((i) and (ii) collectively “Regulated Cannabis”). The Regulated Cannabis industry is illegal under U.S. Federal Law. The Parent Company is directly involved (through its licensed subsidiaries) in both the Adult-Use Cannabis and Medical-Use Cannabis industry in the State of California which has legalized and regulated such industries. 
 The United States federal government regulates certain drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 801-971) (the “CSA”) and through the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 301-392) (the “FDCA”). The CSA schedules controlled substances, including “marihuana” (defined as all parts of the plant cannabis sativa L. containing more than 0.3 percent THC), based on their approved medical use and potential for abuse. Marihuana (also referred to as cannabis) and THC (“except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp”) are each classified as Schedule I controlled substances (21 U.S.C. § 812(c)). The Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which implements and enforces the FDCA, regulates, among other things, drugs used for the diagnosis or treatment of diseases. The FDA has not approved cannabis as a safe and effective treatment for any medical condition, and regularly issues cease-and-desist letters to manufacturers of CBD products making health claims to consumers in contravention of the FDCA. The FDA has approved drugs containing THC and CBD, individual cannabinoids in the plant cannabis sativa L., for a narrow segment of medical conditions. 
 State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of Medical-Use Cannabis or Adult-Use Cannabis are in direct conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis and THC distribution and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize Medical-Use Cannabis or Adult-Use Cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis and THC is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under any and all circumstances under the CSA. Additionally, any manufacture, possession, distribution and/or sale of cannabis accessories, in states without laws expressly permitting such activity, are also federally illegal activity under the CSA. Although the Company’s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable California state and local law, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis does not absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor does it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. 
 As of the filing of March 1, 2022, 37 U.S. states, and the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands have legalized the cultivation and sale of Medical-Use Cannabis, with at least six of the remaining states expected to pass such legalization measures within the next 12 months. In 18 U.S. states, the sale and possession of both Medical-Use Cannabis and Adult-Use Cannabis has been legalized, though due to the time period between a state’s legalization of commercial cannabis activities and the completion of its regulatory framework and marketplace launch, the purchase of Adult-Use Cannabis is currently possible in 12 states, with the remainder of the currently-legal states to commence sales activities in 2022 or 2023. The District of Columbia has legalized Adult-Use Cannabis but has not yet permitted the commercial sale of Adult Use Cannabis, however, Adult-Use sales are expected to commence in 2022. Eleven states have also enacted low-THC / high-CBD only laws for medical cannabis patients. The sale and possession of both Medical-Use Cannabis and Adult-Use Cannabis is legal in the State of California, subject to applicable licensing requirements and compliance with applicable conditions. Included in the numbers above are ballot initiatives to legalize Adult-Use Cannabis which passed in November 2020, with Arizona commencing Adult-Use sales in January 2021, New Jersey and Montana to commence Adult-Use sales in 2022, South Dakota to commence Adult-Use sales in 2023, and Mississippi enacting Medical-Use cannabis legislation in January 2022, following a successful ballot initiative and subsequent invalidation on technical grounds by the Mississippi State Supreme Court. 
 Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. administration attempted to address the inconsistencies between federal and state regulation of cannabis in a memorandum which then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all United States Attorneys on August 29, 2013 (the “2013 Cole Memorandum”) outlining certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The 
 
13 

  2013 Cole Memorandum noted that in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing or decriminalizing Regulated Cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of Regulated Cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. The DOJ did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the 2013 Cole Memorandum. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the 2013 Cole Memorandum concluded that the DOJ should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, a non-exhaustive list of which was enumerated therein. 
 On January 4, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally issued a new memorandum (the “Sessions Memorandum”), which rescinded all “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement,” including the 2013 Cole Memorandum. The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects “Congress’ determination that Cannabis is a dangerous drug and Cannabis activity is a serious crime”, and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress by following well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. There can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities despite the existence of State-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and resultantly it is uncertain how active U.S. federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities. 
 The Company believes it is still unclear what prosecutorial effects will be created by the rescission of the 2013 Cole Memorandum. The Company believes that the sheer size of the Regulated Cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the DOJ and the Biden administration in certain states that heavily favor decriminalization and/or legalization. Regardless, cannabis and THC remain Schedule I controlled substances at the federal level, and neither the 2013 Cole Memorandum nor its rescission has altered that fact. The federal government of the United States has always reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the manufacture, distribution, sale and disbursement of Medical-Use Cannabis or Adult-Use Cannabis, even if state law permits such manufacture, distribution, sale and disbursement. The Company believes, from a purely legal perspective, that the criminal risk today remains similar to the risk on January 3, 2018. It remains unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered. Additionally, under United States federal law, it is a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of Regulated Cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Canadian banks are likewise hesitant to deal with cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework of the industry. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to Regulated Cannabis businesses. While Congress is considering legislation that may address these issues, there can be no assurance that such legislation passes. 
 Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned Regulated Cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the 2013 Cole Memorandum and stated that in some circumstances, it is possible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories—cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminated—based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. On the same day that the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the “2014 Cole Memorandum”) directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the 2013 Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The 2014 Cole Memorandum has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the 2013 Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes against state-compliant actors was not a DOJ priority. 
 However, former Attorney General Sessions’ rescission of the 2013 Cole Memorandum and the 2014 Cole Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 Cole Memorandum and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum is a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the 2013 Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. However, FinCEN issued further guidance on December 3, 2019, in which it acknowledged that the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”) removed hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance and authorized the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to issue regulations governing, among other things, domestic hemp production. The guidance states that because hemp is no longer a controlled substance under federal law, 
 
14 

  banks are not required to file SARs on these businesses solely because they are engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The guidance further notes that for hemp-related customers, banks are expected to follow standard SAR procedures, and file a SAR if indicia of suspicious activity warrants. FinCEN noted in its December 2019 guidance that the 2014 SAR reporting structure for cannabis remains in place even with the passage of the Farm Bill and this additional guidance related to hemp. FinCEN confirmed this point in guidance issued on June 29, 2020, and clarified that, if proceeds from cannabis-related activities are kept separate, a SAR filing is only required for the cannabis-related part of a business that engages in both cannabis and hemp activity. 
 Although the 2013 Cole Memorandum has been rescinded, one legislative safeguard for the Medical-Use Cannabis industry has historically remained in place: Congress adopted a so-called “rider” provision to the fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, 2019 and 2020 and 2021. Consolidated Appropriations Acts (currently referred to as the “Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated Medical-Use Cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. On March 15, 2022, the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment was renewed through the signing of the fiscal year 2022 omnibus bill, which extended the protections of the Amendment through September 30, 2022. The Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment may or may not be included in a subsequent omnibus appropriations package or a continuing budget resolution. Should the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment not be renewed upon expiration in subsequent spending bills, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not seek to prosecute cases involving medical cannabis businesses that are otherwise compliant with State law. Such potential proceedings could involve significant restrictions being imposed upon the Company. 
 The United States Congress has passed appropriations bills each of the last four years that have not appropriated funds for prosecution of cannabis offenses of individuals who are in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. American courts have construed these appropriations bills to prevent the U.S. federal government from prosecuting individuals when those individuals comply with state law relating to approved medical uses. However, because this conduct continues to violate U.S. federal law, American courts have observed that should Congress at any time choose to appropriate funds to fully prosecute the CSA, any individual or business – even those that have fully complied with state law – could be prosecuted for violations of U.S. federal law. And if Congress restores funding, the government will have the authority to prosecute individuals for violations of the law that took place before received funding under the CSA’s five-year statute of limitations. 
 In recent years, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the Medical-Use Cannabis and industry have also been in effect. For instance, cannabis businesses that are in strict compliance with state law receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of a temporary appropriations measures that has been enacted into law as an amendment (or “rider”) to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden. First adopted in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress has included in successive budgets since a “rider” that prohibits the DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a state’s implementation of its own medical cannabis laws. The rider, discussed above, is known as the “Rohrbacher-Blumenauer” Amendment, and now known colloquially as the “Joyce-Amendment” after its most recent sponsors. The rider was renewed on March 15, 2022 through the signing of the FY 2022 omnibus spending bill, which extended the protections of the Amendment through September 30, 2022. 
 Despite the legal, regulatory, and political obstacles the Regulated Cannabis industry currently faces, the industry has continued to grow. Under certain circumstances, the federal government may repeal the federal prohibition on cannabis and thereby leave the states to decide for themselves whether to permit Regulated Cannabis cultivation, production and sale, just as states are free today to decide policies governing the distribution of alcohol or tobacco. Until that happens, the Company faces the risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with the Company’s business. 
 To the knowledge of management of the Company, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in California. 
 The Company’s objective is to capitalize on the opportunities presented as a result of the changing regulatory environment governing the cannabis industry in the United States. Accordingly, there are a number of significant risks associated with the business of the Company. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to Medical-Use Cannabis or Adult-Use Cannabis, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and the business of the Company may be deemed to be producing, cultivating, extracting, or dispensing “marihuana” or aiding or abetting or otherwise engaging in a conspiracy to commit such acts in violation of U.S. federal law. 
 The Company has received and continues to receive legal input, in verbal and written form (including opinions when required), regarding (a) compliance with applicable state and local regulatory frameworks and (b) potential exposure and implications arising from U.S. federal law in certain respects. 
 
15 

  The 2013 Cole Memorandum and the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment gave Medical-Use Cannabis operators and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding federal enforcement as to establish Regulated Cannabis businesses in those states. While the Sessions Memorandum has introduced some uncertainty regarding federal enforcement, the Regulated Cannabis industry continues to experience growth in legal Medical-Use Cannabis and Adult-Use Cannabis markets across the United States. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned on November 7, 2018. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, even under a Biden Administration’s DOJ or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis and THC (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. 
 Despite the expanding market for Regulated Cannabis, traditional sources of financing, including bank lending or private equity capital, are lacking which can be attributable to the fact that cannabis remains a Schedule I substance under the CSA. These traditional sources of financing are expected to remain scarce unless and until the federal government legalizes cannabis cultivation and sales. 
 The following table is intended to assist readers in identifying those parts of this Annual Report that address the disclosure expectations outlined in Staff Notice 51-352 issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators for issuers that currently have marijuana-related activities in U.S. states where such activity has been authorized within a state regulatory framework.

 California Regulatory Landscape 
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize Medical-Use Cannabis through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legislation legalized the use, possession and cultivation of cannabis by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which cannabis provides relief. 
 In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing not-for-profit medical cannabis collectives and dispensaries, and an optional identification card system for Medical-Use Cannabis patients. 
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for Medical-Use Cannabis businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”), creating an Adult-Use Cannabis program for adults 21 years of age or older. In June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamated MCRSA and AUMA and provided for a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. The four agencies that regulate cannabis at the state level are the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), CalCannabis at the California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CalCannabis”), and the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch California Department of Public Health (“MCSB”), and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. MAUCRSA was then amended and restated in July 2021 through the annual budget trailer bill process to, among other things, consolidate the three state licensing agencies—BCC, CalCannabis and MCSB—into a single licensing authority known as the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). Subsequent to the agency consolidation, the newly formed DCC consolidated the three separate sets of BCC, CalCannabis, and MCSB regulations into a single set of state regulations, which regulations went into effect as of September 27, 2021. 
 To legally operate a Medical-Use Cannabis or Adult-Use Cannabis business in California, the operator must generally have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing programs. Therefore, counties and cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators, or can choose to outright ban the siting of cannabis operations in their jurisdictions. 
 California Licensing Requirements 
 A storefront retailer license with an “M-designation” permits (i) the purchase of cannabis goods that are “For Medical Use Only” from licensed distributors (ii) the sale of such medicinal cannabis goods to medicinal cannabis patients in California who possesses a physician’s recommendation. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal cannabis recommendations. A storefront retailer license with an “A-designation” permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older regardless of whether they possess a physician’s recommendation. A storefront retailer license with both the M- and A-designations is permitted to do all of the above described in this paragraph. Where the local jurisdiction permits, a state storefront retailer license allows the retailer to engage in delivery of cannabis goods to retail customers. A non-storefront license permits the same delivery activity, but does not permit the licensee to operate a retail storefront. 
 A distribution license permits the license holder to engage in the procurement, sale, and transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensees. 
 An adult-use or medicinal cultivation license permits cannabis cultivation which means any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production of a limited number of “non-manufactured cannabis products” and the sales of cannabis to certain licensed entities within the State of California for resale or manufacturing purposes. 
 An adult-use or medical manufacturing license permits the manufacturing of “manufactured cannabis products”. Manufacturing includes the compounding, blending, extracting, infusion, packaging or repackaging, labeling or relabeling, or other preparation of a cannabis product in the State of California, only cannabis that is grown in the state by a licensed operator can be sold in the state. California neither mandates or prohibits integration, and the state allows licensees to make wholesale purchase of cannabis from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state. 
 
18 

  Holders of cannabis licenses in California are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing security, staffing, transport, sales, manufacturing standards, testing, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, white labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations, as promulgated by each applicable state agency, should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area. 
 California Reporting Requirements 
 The State of California uses METRC as the state’s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all state-issued licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to METRC. 
California Storage and Security 
 To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, California’s retail cannabis businesses are generally required to do the following: 

• | limit access to dispensary premises to medical cannabis patients at least 18 years and older, and adults 21 and over;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain a fully operational security alarm system;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | contract for professionally-certified security guard services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensure that the facility’s outdoor premises have sufficient lighting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not dispense from its premises outside of permissible hours of operation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limit the amount of cannabis goods dispensed to individual customers to prevent diversion;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | store cannabis and cannabis product only in limited-access areas per the premises diagram submitted to the State of California during the licensing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault with limited-access areas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion, or loss of cannabis; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities, maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products. Only vehicles that meet DCC distribution requirements are to be used to transport cannabis and cannabis products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

California Home Delivery Requirements 
 California law allows certain licensed retailers to deliver cannabis to adult customers at any private address within the state, including within those jurisdictions that have land use and zoning ordinances prohibiting the establishment of commercial cannabis businesses. At least 25 local jurisdictions where cannabis sales are banned sued the state, seeking to overturn the rule allowing home deliveries statewide. As of the date hereof, the suit was dismissed on procedural grounds, and the state regulation stands. To the knowledge of management, there have been no significant enforcement efforts mounted by local governments. 
 The State of California requires the satisfaction of various regulatory compliance obligations in order to operate a cannabis delivery service. The cannabis license that permits the operation of a storefront dispensary in the State of California (also referred to as a retail license) currently permits that entity to also establish a delivery operation. If an entity does not wish to set up and operate a storefront dispensary location at which it can sell products to customers in person, California has established a separate license which allows for a retail delivery operation (also referred to as a non-storefront retail license). California regulations regarding the delivery of cannabis products include the following requirements: 
 

• | All deliveries of cannabis goods must be performed by a delivery employee (at least 21 years of age) who is directly employed by a licensed retailer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All deliveries of cannabis goods must be made in person to a physical address that is not on public land.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to providing cannabis goods to a delivery customer, a delivery employee must confirm the identity and age of the delivery customer (as is required if such customer was purchasing the product in the physical dispensary) and ensure that all cannabis goods sold comply with the regulatory requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



19 

  
• | A licensed cannabis entity is permitted to contract with a service that provides a technology platform to facilitate the sale and delivery of cannabis goods, in accordance with all of the following: (1) the licensed cannabis entity does not allow for delivery of cannabis goods by the technology platform service provider; (2) the licensed entity does not share in the profits of the sale of cannabis goods with the technology platform service provider, or otherwise provide for a percentage or portion of the cannabis goods sales to the technology platform service provider; (3) the licensed cannabis entity does not advertise or market cannabis goods in conjunction with the technology platform service provider, outside of the technology platform, and ensures that the technology platform service provider does not use the licensed cannabis entity’s license number or legal business name on any advertisement or marketing that primarily promotes the services of the technology platform; and (4) provides various disclosures to customers about the source of the delivered cannabis goods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Laws Applicable to Financial Services for Regulated Cannabis Industry 
 All banks are subject to federal law, whether the bank is a national bank or state-chartered bank. At a minimum, most banks maintain federal deposit insurance which requires adherence to federal law. Violation of federal law could subject a bank to loss of its charter. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statutes and the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (31 U.S.C. § 5311 et seq) (commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”). For example, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks must report to the federal government any suspected illegal activity, which would include any transaction associated with a Regulated Cannabis-related business. These reports must be filed even though the business is operating in compliance with applicable state and local laws. Therefore, financial institutions that conduct transactions with money generated by Regulated Cannabis-related conduct could face criminal liability under the Bank Secrecy Act for, among other things, failing to identify or report financial transactions that involve the proceeds of cannabis-related violations of the CSA. 
 FinCEN issued guidance in February 2014 which clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Concurrently with the FinCEN guidance, the DOJ issued supplemental guidance directing federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the 2013 Cole Memorandum with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money transmitter and Bank Secrecy Act offenses based on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. The FinCEN guidance sets forth extensive requirements for financial institutions to meet if they want to offer bank accounts to cannabis-related businesses, including close monitoring of businesses to determine that they meet all of the requirements established by the DOJ, including those enumerated in the 2013 Cole Memorandum. This is a level of scrutiny that is far beyond what is expected of any normal banking relationship. Under the 2019 FinCEN guidance discussed above, banks are not required to file SARs on businesses solely because they are engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. However, the 2014 guidance remains in place with respect to Regulated Cannabis businesses. FinCEN confirmed this point in guidance issued on June 29, 2020, and clarified that, if proceeds from cannabis-related activities are kept separate, a SAR filing is only required for the cannabis-related part of a business that engages in both cannabis and hemp activity. 
 As a result, many banks are hesitant to offer any banking services to Regulated Cannabis-related businesses, including opening bank accounts. While the Company currently has bank accounts, its inability to maintain these accounts or the lack of access to bank accounts or other banking services in the future, would make it difficult for the Company to operate its business, increase its operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges. Furthermore, it remains unclear what impact the rescission of the 2013 Cole Memorandum and 2014 Cole Memorandum will have, but federal prosecutors may increase enforcement activities against institutions or individuals that are conducting financial transactions related to cannabis activities. 
 The increased uncertainty surrounding financial transactions related to cannabis activities may also result in financial institutions discontinuing services to the cannabis industry. See “Risk Factors”.
