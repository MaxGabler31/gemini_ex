Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a leader in RNA-targeted therapeutics. We believe our medicines, which are based on our novel antisense technology, have the potential to pioneer new markets, change standards of care and transform the lives of people with devastating diseases. We currently have three marketed medicines- SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. We also have a rich late-stage pipeline of medicines, primarily focused on our cardiovascular and neurology franchises. Our late-stage pipeline consists of six medicines in Phase 3 development for eight indications.
 
Over the past year, we made important progress toward achieving our goal to be a leading fully integrated biotechnology company. We advanced our commercial strategy and go-to-market plans for our near-term commercial opportunities, eplontersen, olezarsen and donidalorsen. We entered an agreement with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize eplontersen. We believe this agreement positions eplontersen to maximize value for patients and shareholders while also enabling us to bolster our commercial organization and accelerate our preparations for our near-term product launches.
 
We continued to advance and expand our Phase 3 pipeline with the achievement of key enrollment milestones for eplontersen and pelacarsen, and the addition of two new Phase 3 programs for olezarsen and donidalorsen, bringing us to 6 medicines in Phase 3 development addressing 8 indications. In 2021, we also reported data from the Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen in patients with SOD1-ALS. While VALOR did not achieve statistical significance in the primary endpoint, signs of reduced disease progression were observed across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints. Biogen is actively engaged with regulators to determine the next steps for tofersen. In addition, Roche recently announced plans to initiate a new Phase 2 study of tominersen in patients with Huntington’s disease, based on new findings from a post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen.
 
Our mid-stage pipeline also continued to perform well, with positive data readouts from several medicines. And we invested in expanding the reach of our technology, including obtaining exclusive rights to Bicycle Therapeutic’s peptide technology targeting transferrin receptor 1 to expand the capabilities of our Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology. We strengthened our financial position and focused our resources in support of our highest priority programs through the integration of Akcea Therapeutics and our distribution agreements with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi. We accomplished all this and exceeded our 2021 financial guidance, including achieving revenues of $810 million. And we remain well capitalized with a 2021 year-end cash balance of $2.1 billion.
 
 Our multiple sources of revenue and strong balance sheet enable us to invest in our strategic priorities to build our commercial pipeline, expand and diversify our technology and deliver new medicines to the market. By continuing to focus on these priorities, we believe we are well positioned to drive future growth and to deliver increasing value for patients and shareholders.
 
Marketed Medicines
 
SPINRAZA is the global foundation-of-care for the treatment of patients of all ages with spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, a progressive, debilitating and often fatal genetic disease. Biogen, our partner responsible for commercializing SPINRAZA worldwide, reported that as of December 31, 2021, over 11,000 patients were on SPINRAZA therapy in markets around the world. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have earned more than $1.6 billion in revenues from our SPINRAZA collaboration, including nearly $1.2 b
illion in royalties on sales of SPINRAZA.
 
TEGSEDI is a once weekly, self-administered subcutaneous medicine approved in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR, a debilitating, progressive, and fatal disease. We launched TEGSEDI in the U.S. and the European Union, or EU, in late 2018. In 2021, we began selling TEGSEDI in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2021, Sobi began distributing TEGSEDI in the U.S. and Canada. In Latin America, PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC, is commercializing TEGSEDI in Brazil and is pursuing access in additional Latin American countries through its exclusive license agreement with us.
  


WAYLIVRA is a once weekly, self-administered, subcutaneous medicine that received conditional marketing authorization in May 2019 from the European Commission, or EC, as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, and at high risk for pancreatitis. We launched WAYLIVRA in the EU in the third quarter of 2019. In 2021, we began selling WAYLIVRA in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. Through our exclusive license agreement with PTC, PTC is working to provide access to WAYLIVRA across Latin America, beginning in Brazil. In the third quarter of 2021, the National Health Surveillance Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária), or 
ANVISA, approved WAYLIVRA in Brazil. In December 2021, PTC submitted an application to ANVISA for approval of WAYLIVRA for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL, in Brazil. If approved, Waylivra will be the first approved treatment for patients with FPL in Brazil.
 
Under our distribution agreements with Sobi, we retained the marketing authorizations for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. We will continue to supply commercial product to Sobi and manage regulatory and manufacturing processes, as well as relationships with key opinion leaders. We will also continue to lead the TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA global commercial strategy. In connection with the agreements, we restructured our European operations in the first quarter of 2021, and we restructured our North American TEGSEDI operations in the second quarter of 2021.

Our Marketed Medicines – Potentially Transformational Medicines Bringing Value to Patients Today
 
SPINRAZA – SPINRAZA (nusinersen) injection for intrathecal use is a survival motor neuron-2, or SMN2, directed antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients.
 
SPINRAZA continues to demonstrate substantial benefit in SMA patients of all ages, supporting its position as a global foundation of care for the treatment of SMA. Biogen, our worldwide commercial partner, reported that as of December 31, 2021, there were more than 11,000 patients on SPINRAZA therapy.
 
SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, People with SMA have a deletion or defect in their SMN1 gene and rely on their SMN2 gene to produce functional SMN protein, which motor neurons need to maintain motor function and muscle strength. However, the SMN2 gene can only produce approximately 10 percent of the SMN protein critical for motor neurons, resulting in severe and progressive loss of motor function and strength.
 
The rate and severity of degeneration varies depending on the amount of functional SMN protein a patient can produce. Type 1, or infantile-onset, SMA is the most severe form of the disease. Type 1 SMA patients produce very little SMN protein and often progress to death or permanent ventilation by the age of 2. Patients with Type 2 or Type 3, or later-onset, SMA produce more SMN protein, but also suffer from a progressive loss of muscle strength and function and a reduced life expectancy.
 
Biogen continues to expand the body of evidence supporting SPINRAZA’s durable efficacy and well-established safety profile to address the remaining needs of SMA patients of all ages. In the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study, Biogen is evaluating the safety and potential to achieve increased efficacy with a higher dose of SPINRAZA compared to the currently approved dose. At the AAN 2021 Virtual Annual meeting in April 2021, Biogen reported that initial findings from the DEVOTE study suggest no new safety concerns and support continued development of a higher dose of SPINRAZA.
 
In January 2021, Biogen initiated the Phase 4 RESPOND study evaluating the benefit of SPINRAZA in infants and children with a suboptimal clinical response to the gene therapy, onasemnogene abeparvovec.
 
And in September 2021, Biogen initiated the Phase 3b ASCEND study designed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and assess the safety of a higher dose of SPINRAZA in children, teens and adults with later-onset SMA following treatment of risdiplam.
 
Additionally, Biogen continues to conduct the Phase 2 NURTURE study, an open-label study investigating the benefit of SPINRAZA when administered before symptom onset in patients genetically diagnosed with SMA, and likely to develop Type 1 or Type 2 SMA. NURTURE was the first study to investigate the potential to slow or stop SMA disease progression in presymptomatic SMA patients. In June 2021, Biogen reported data from an interim analysis, showing that all study patients remain alive without the need for permanent ventilation. Additionally, at the time of the interim analysis, 92 percent of patients maintained the ability to swallow.
 
The approval of SPINRAZA was based on efficacy and safety data from multiple clinical studies, including two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, ENDEAR, in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, in patients with later-onset SMA as well as from SHINE, an open-label extension, or OLE, study for patients with SMA who participated in prior SPINRAZA studies.
 
TEGSEDI – TEGSEDI (inotersen) injection is an RNA-targeted medicine indicated for the treatment of polyneuropathy due to hATTR in adults. TEGSEDI prevents the creation of TTR proteins, reducing the amount of amyloid that builds up, which damages organs and issues.
 
Polyneuropathy due to hATTR is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein in the peripheral nerves. Patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of motor functions, such as walking. These patients also accumulate TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromises their function and eventually leads to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset. There are an estimated 40,000 patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR worldwide.
 
TEGSEDI is commercially available in numerous countries, including the U.S., many European countries, Canada, and Latin America. In 2021, we began selling TEGSEDI in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2021, Sobi began distributing TEGSEDI in the U.S. and Canada. In Latin America, PTC through its exclusive license agreement with us, is commercializing TEGSEDI in Brazil and is working to achieve access in additional Latin American countries.
  


The approvals of TEGSEDI were based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with stage 1 and stage 2 polyneuropathy. We also conducted an OLE study in patients with hATTR treated with TEGSEDI to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety profile of TEGSEDI. We reported interim data from the study that demonstrated continued efficacy in patients after two years. Results also showed that patients who started treatment earlier achieved greater long-term disease stabilization compared to those who switched from placebo to TEGSEDI in the OLE study.
 
WAYLIVRA – WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen) is an antisense medicine indicated as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. WAYLIVRA reduces triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apolipoprotein C-III, or apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride levels.
 
FCS is a rare, genetic disease estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 people worldwide and characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels. FCS can lead to many chronic health issues including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, fatigue, high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis and abnormal enlargement of the liver or spleen. In addition, people with FCS are often unable to work, adding to their disease burden. In severe cases, patients can have bleeding into the pancreas, serious tissue damage, infection, and cyst formation, as well as damage to other vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.
 
WAYLIVRA is commercially available in multiple European countries and in Brazil. In 2021, we began selling WAYLIVRA in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. In Latin America, PTC through its exclusive license agreement with us, is commercializing WAYLIVRA in Brazil and is working to achieve access in additional Latin American countries.
 
WAYLIVRA’s conditional marketing authorization in the EU and approval in Brazil were based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 APPROACH study, the ongoing APPROACH OLE study and supported by results from the Phase 3 COMPASS study.
 
Drug Discovery and Development
 
Introduction to Drug Discovery
 
Proteins are essential working molecules in a cell. Almost all human diseases result from inappropriate protein production, improper protein activity or loss of a protein. Antisense medicines can modify the production of proteins by targeting RNAs. In this way, antisense medicines can inhibit the production of a disease-causing protein, modify the protein produced or increase the production of a protein that, when absent, causes diseases. Antisense medicines can also treat diseases by targeting and reducing RNAs that may be causing diseases (so called “toxic RNAs”). RNAs are naturally occurring molecules in the body that primarily act as messengers that carry the information the cell needs to produce proteins from the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, to the protein making complex in the cell. When antisense medicines bind to the specific RNAs of a particular gene, they will ultimately alter the production of the protein encoded in the target gene or, in the case of disease-causing RNAs, degrade the toxic RNAs.
Our Pipeline
 
We are a leader in the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics. We are focused on pioneering new markets and changing standards of care with a focus on cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Additionally, we are developing a number of medicines that are outside these areas. We also have an emerging specialty rare disease pipeline comprised of medicines which we believe represent a compelling opportunity for us. We are developing our medicines for systemic and local delivery (e.g., subcutaneous, intrathecal, intraocular, oral and aerosol). We plan to continue adding new investigational medicines to our pipeline in the future.
 
We have built a rich pipeline of medicines designed to treat many serious diseases. To select the best candidates, we efficiently screen many targets in parallel and apply our rational approach to selecting disease targets. With our expertise in discovering and characterizing novel antisense medicines, our scientists can optimize the properties of our antisense medicines against each particular target. We have created LICA technology, which we designed to enhance the effective uptake and activity of our medicines in particular tissues. With our LICA technology we attach specific chemical structures or molecules to our antisense medicines. With our first LICA conjugate, a complex sugar-like molecule called N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNAc, we have shown an increase in medicinal potency of 20-30-fold for liver targets, compared to non-conjugated antisense medicines. Many of the medicines in our pipeline are LICA medicines, including four LICA medicines currently in Phase 3 studies: eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen and pelacarsen. We have utilized our chemistry advancements to expand the therapeutic and commercial opportunities of our pipeline. Our antisense technology, along with our manufacturing and analytical processes that are the same across our medicines, shorten our timeline from initial concept to the first human dose, when compared to early development timelines for other drug modalities like small molecule and monoclonal antibody medicines.
 
 


The table below lists the medicines in our clinical pipeline. We categorize patient studies to establish a medicine’s safety profile as Phase 1/2 and those studies in healthy volunteers as Phase 1. The table includes the disease indication, a partner (if the medicine is partnered), and the development status of each medicine. We have included descriptions for each of our medicines in Phase 2 and Phase 3 development below.

Our Phase 3 Medicines
 
We currently have six medicines in Phase 3 studies for eight indications: eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen and tofersen.
 


Eplontersen (TTR) – Eplontersen (formerly IONIS-TTR-LRx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of TTR protein. We are developing eplontersen as a monthly self-administered subcutaneous injection to treat all types of ATTR. ATTR amyloidosis is a systemic, progressive and fatal disease in which patients experience multiple overlapping clinical manifestations caused by the inappropriate formation and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal tract, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to organ failure and eventually death.
  

Polyneuropathy due to hATTR is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein in the peripheral nerves. Patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of motor functions, such as walking. These patients also accumulate TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromises their function and eventually leads to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset. There are an estimated 40,000 patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR worldwide.
 
ATTR cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in the cardiac muscle. Patients experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within 3 to 5 years from disease onset. ATTR cardiomyopathy includes both the genetic and wild-type form of the disease. There are an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy worldwide.
 
Often patients with the polyneuropathy form of TTR amyloidosis will have TTR build up in the heart and experience cardiomyopathy symptoms. Similarly, patients with the cardiomyopathy form of TTR amyloidosis may often have TTR build up in their peripheral nerves and experience nerve damage and progressive difficulty with motor functions.


In November 2019, we initiated the NEURO-TTRansform Phase 3 study of eplontersen in patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. NEURO-TTRansform is a global, multi-center, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eplontersen. The NEURO-TTRansform study is fully enrolled with 168 patients. We expect data from the NEURO-TTRansform study in mid-2022. The current study will be compared to the historical placebo arm from the TEGSEDI (inotersen) NEURO-TTR Phase 3 study. The NEURO-TTRansform study includes multiple primary endpoints, including the percent change from baseline in serum TTR concentration modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7, or mNIS+7, a measure of neuropathic disease progression and in the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy, or Norfolk QoL-DN.
 
In January 2020, we initiated the CARDIO-TTRansform Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study of eplontersen in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. CARDIO-TTRansform is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in up to 750 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eplontersen. The CARDIO-TTRansform study includes co-primary outcome measures of cardiovascular death and frequency of cardiovascular clinical events.
  


In September 2019, we reported results from the Phase 1 study with eplontersen in healthy volunteers at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Meeting. In this study, subjects treated with eplontersen achieved dose-dependent reductions of TTR protein of up to 94 percent and eplontersen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In January 2022, the FDA granted an Orphan Medicine Designation for eplontersen.
 
In December 2021, we entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize eplontersen in the U.S. AstraZeneca obtained exclusive rights to commercialize eplontersen outside the U.S, except for certain Latin American countries.
 
Olezarsen (ApoC-III) – Olezarsen (formerly IONIS-APOCIII-LRx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of apoC-III for patients who are at risk of disease due to elevated triglyceride levels. ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood. People with severely elevated triglycerides, such as people with FCS, are at high risk for acute pancreatitis and an increased risk of CVD. It is estimated that there are between 3,000 to 5,000 patients with FCS worldwide and more than three million patients with severely high triglycerides in the U.S.
 
In December 2020, we initiated our first Phase 3 study of olezarsen, BALANCE, in patients with FCS. BALANCE is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 60 patients (age 18 and over) designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of olezarsen. The primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in fasting triglyceride levels at six months compared to placebo.
 
In November 2021, we initiated a second Phase 3 study of olezarsen, CORE, in patients with SHTG. CORE is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 450 patients designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of olezarsen. The CORE study will compare olezarsen to placebo in patients with triglyceride levels equal to or greater than 500 mg/dL who are on currently available therapies for elevated triglycerides. The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change in fasting triglycerides from baseline at month 6.
 
In January 2020, we reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and at high risk of or with established CVD. Olezarsen achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels. Additionally, at the highest monthly dose, 91 percent of patients achieved serum triglycerides of ≤ 150 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for cardiovascular risk, compared to less than 5 percent of patients in the placebo group. Olezarsen also achieved statistical significance in numerous key secondary endpoints, including significant reductions in apoC-III, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C, and remnant cholesterol, and a statistically significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C. Olezarsen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
Donidalorsen (PKK) – Donidalorsen (formerly IONIS-PKK-LRx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, to treat people with HAE. HAE is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx, and trachea and can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. PKK plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE. By inhibiting the production of PKK, donidalorsen could be an effective prophylactic approach to preventing or reducing the severity of HAE attacks. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 patients with HAE in the U.S. and EU.
 
In November 2021, we initiated the Phase 3 study of donidalorsen, OASIS-HAE, in patients with HAE. OASIS-HAE is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study in up to 84 patients designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of olezarsen. The primary endpoint is the time-normalized number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month from Week 1 to Week 25.
 
In March 2021, we reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical study of donidalorsen in patients with HAE. Patients received either donidalorsen 80mg or placebo subcutaneously once monthly for 17 weeks. The Phase 2 study met its primary and secondary endpoints, achieving significant reductions in the number of attacks suffered by patients with HAE compared to placebo. The study demonstrated a mean reduction of 90 percent in the number of monthly HAE attacks in weeks one to 17 of the study (p <0.001) and a mean reduction of 97 percent in the number of monthly HAE attacks in weeks five to 17 (p=0.003). In weeks five to 17, 92 percent of patients treated with donidalorsen were attack-free compared to 0 percent in the placebo group (p <0.001). Additionally, in November 2021 we reported additional data from the Phase 2 study, including that donidalorsen demonstrated an overall reduction in moderate to severe attacks starting with the second dose. For the final month of the study, all donidalorsen treated patients were attack-free. Donidalorsen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In September 2020, results from the Phase 1 study of donidalorsen in healthy volunteers and a compassionate-use study of IONIS-PKKRx and donidalorsen in patients living with severe angioedema were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, we observed that the medicines reduced plasma prekallikrein activity levels and showed evidence of clinical efficacy in reducing the number of breakthrough attacks per month in patients over the course of the treatment, including complete resolution in a patient.
  

ION363 (FUS) – ION363 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to reduce the production of the FUS protein to treat people with ALS caused by mutations in the FUS gene. Because antisense-mediated reduction of mutant FUS protein in a FUS-ALS mouse model demonstrated the ability to prevent motor neuron loss, it is hypothesized that reduction of FUS protein will reverse or prevent disease progression in FUS-ALS patients. It is estimated that there are approximately 350 patients with FUS-ALS in G7 countries (comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S.).
 
In April 2021, we initiated a Phase 3 study of ION363 in patients with FUS-ALS. The Phase 3 trial of ION363 is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 64 patients designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ION363. Part 1 of the trial will consist of patients randomized to receive a multi-dose regimen of ION363 or placebo for 29 weeks, followed by Part 2, which will be an open-label period in which all patients in the trial will receive ION363 for 73 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline as measured by the ALSFRS-R Total Score, time of rescue or discontinuation from Part 1 and entering Part 2 due to a deterioration in function, and Ventilation Assistance-free survival, or VAFS.
 
Pelacarsen (Apo(a)) (TQJ230) – Pelacarsen (formerly IONIS-APO(a)-LRx) is an investigational LICA antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing Lp(a). Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of CVD. Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels. Inhibiting the production of Apo(a) in the liver reduces the level of Lp(a) in blood, potentially slowing down or reversing cardiovascular disease in people with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), a condition in which individuals have levels of Lp(a) greater than 50 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for risk of CVD. We believe antisense technology is well suited to address hyperlipoproteinemia(a) because antisense technology specifically targets the RNA that codes for all forms of the Apo(a) molecule. Furthermore, we believe addressing elevated Lp(a) is the next important horizon in CVD risk reduction. It is estimated that there are more than eight million people living with CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a).
 
In December 2019, Novartis initiated the Phase 3 study of pelacarsen, Lp(a) HORIZON, in patients with elevated Lp(a) levels and a prior cardiovascular event. Lp(a) HORIZON is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes study in more than 8,000 patients designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of pelacarsen. Patients will be treated with 80 mg of pelacarsen administered monthly by subcutaneous injection. The primary endpoint in Lp(a) HORIZON is the time to occurrence of first major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE. In August 2021, we announced that the Lp(a) HORIZON study had reached 50 percent enrollment.
 
In November 2018, we reported results of the Phase 2 study of pelacarsen in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) at the American Heart Association, or AHA, annual meeting. In the Phase 2 study, we observed statistically significant and dose dependent reductions from baseline in Lp(a) levels. Approximately 98 percent of patients who received the highest dose in the study demonstrated a reduction in Lp(a) levels to below 50 mg/dL. Pelacarsen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license pelacarsen. As a result, Novartis is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for pelacarsen.
 
Tofersen (SOD1) (BIIB067) – Tofersen (formerly IONIS-SOD1Rx) is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, which is a well understood genetic cause of ALS. SOD1-ALS is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the SOD1 gene leading to a progressive loss of motor neurons. As a result, people with SOD1-ALS experience increasing muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to the disease. Current treatment options for people with SOD1-ALS are extremely limited, with no medicines that significantly slow disease progression. Tofersen is one of four medicines we have in development to treat ALS. It is estimated that there are approximately 1,400 patients with SOD1-ALS in G7 countries.
 
In October 2021, Biogen announced topline results of the Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen in patients with SOD1-ALS designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tofersen. While tofersen did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline to 28 weeks in the ALSFRS-R, trends favoring tofersen were seen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of disease activity and clinical function. As a result, Biogen is actively engaged with regulators to determine next steps for the program. Additionally, in October 2021, Biogen announced that it would expand eligibility for its ongoing EAP to all people with SOD1-ALS, where permitted.
 
 In April 2021, Biogen initiated a second Phase 3 study of tofersen, ATLAS, in presymptomatic individuals with a SOD1 genetic mutation and biomarker evidence of disease activity. ATLAS is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 150 subjects designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tofersen in presymptomatic individuals with a SOD1 genetic mutation and biomarker evidence of disease activity.
 
 


Biogen conducted a Phase 1/2 study that demonstrated proof of biology and proof of concept. At the highest dose tested, treatment with tofersen over a three month period resulted in a statistically significant lowering of SOD1 protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, and positive numerical trends across three efficacy endpoints compared to placebo, including slowing of clinical decline as measured by the ALSFRS-R. Tofersen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In December 2018, Biogen exercised its option to license tofersen, as a result, Biogen is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for tofersen.
 
Our Cardiovascular Medicines in Development
 
According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, CVD remains the number one cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVD in 2019, representing approximately 30 percent of all deaths globally. Our cardiovascular medicines target the major risk factors of cardiovascular disease, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and hypertension.

ION449 (PCSK9) (AZD8233) – ION449 (formerly IONIS-AZ4-2.5-L-Rx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, in the liver. PCSK9 is integrally involved in the regulation of LDL-cholesterol. Genetic studies have shown that individuals with life-long reductions of LDL-C due to reduced function of PCSK9 have substantially reduced risk of CVD.
 
In November 2020, AstraZeneca initiated the Phase 2b study of ION449 in patients with LDL-C levels between 70 and 190 mg/dl and receiving statin therapy. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in approximately 110 patients to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ION449. The primary objective is to assess the effect of different doses of ION449 on LDL-C compared to placebo at Week 12 in patients taking baseline statin therapy. The study will evaluate three dose levels of ION449 versus placebo, all administered once a month by subcutaneous injection.
 
In November 2021, we reported positive results from the Phase 1 study of ION449 in patients with dyslipidemia. Participants were treated with multiple ascending subcutaneous doses and ION449 demonstrated dose-dependent mean reductions in circulating plasma PCSK9 and LDL-C levels and had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In October 2020, we reported positive results from the Phase 1 study of ION449 in healthy volunteers. Participants were treated with a single subcutaneous dose and ION449 demonstrated dose-dependent mean reductions in circulating plasma PCSK9 and LDL-C levels and had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
We licensed ION449 to AstraZeneca under our cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases collaboration. As a result, AstraZeneca is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for ION449.
  


Fesomersen (FXI) (BAY2976217) – Fesomersen (formerly IONIS-FXI-LRx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of Factor XI. Factor XI is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is important in the growth of blood clots. Thrombosis, characterized by the formation of a blood clot inside blood vessels, can cause heart attacks and strokes. People who are deficient in Factor XI have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events with minimal increase in bleeding risk. Although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis, physicians associate these anticoagulants with increased bleeding, which can be fatal. By inhibiting Factor XI production, we believe that fesomersen can be used broadly as an anti-thrombotic in many different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated anti-thrombotic medicines are needed.
 
In August 2020, Bayer initiated the RE-THINc Phase 2b study of fesomersen in patients with end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, on hemodialysis. RE-THINc is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 290 patients to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of fesomersen. The study is designed to evaluate multiple monthly doses administered subcutaneously. The primary endpoint is incidence of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding.
 
We conducted a Phase 1, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of fesomersen in healthy volunteers. In this study, fesomersen produced significant reductions in FXI activity and FXI antigen, without evidence of increased bleeding and had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In February 2017, we licensed fesomersen to Bayer. As a result, Bayer is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for fesomersen.
 
IONIS-AGT-LRx – IONIS-AGT-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of angiotensinogen to decrease blood pressure in people with treatment resistant hypertension, or TRH. Despite the availability of antihypertensive agents, TRH is still a major contributor to cardiovascular and renal disease. Approximately 140 million adults globally and approximately 10 million adults in the U.S. have resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve a blood pressure goal of 140/90 (systolic/diastolic) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications. People with TRH have been found to have a three-fold higher chance of having fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events relative to those with controlled hypertension.
 
We are also studying IONIS-AGT-LRx in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Heart failure, or HF, afflicts approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States, or U.S., and 26 million worldwide. As the population ages, HF incidence is increasing, and more than 550,000 patients are diagnosed with HF each year. HF is responsible for more hospitalizations than all forms of cancer combined and is the most common diagnosis in hospital patients 65 years and older. Every year over 1 million patients are hospitalized for HF in the U.S. and Europe, accounting for 6.5 million hospital days. High rates of hospitalizations with frequent readmission (almost 25 percent of patients with HF are readmitted within 30 days) along with other direct and indirect costs, also place an enormous economic burden on healthcare systems. Despite new advances in medical therapy, the residual risk for patients with HF is still high.
 
In January 2021, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study of IONIS-AGT-LRx in patients with hypertension uncontrolled with three or more antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs. The study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 150 patients to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IONIS-AGT-LRx. We designed the study to evaluate multiple doses administered subcutaneously. The primary endpoint is the change in systolic blood pressure, or SBP, from baseline.
 
In September 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of IONIS-AGT-LRx in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately 75 patients to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IONIS-AGT-LRx. We designed the study to evaluate multiple doses administered subcutaneously. The primary endpoint is the percent change in plasma AGT concentration from baseline.
 
We evaluated IONIS-AGT-LRx in two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies. The first study was in people with mild hypertension and the second was in people with TRH who were on two or three antihypertensive medications, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs. IONIS-AGT-LRx significantly reduced AGT levels compared with placebo in both studies. Although not powered for this endpoint, trends were noted in blood pressure reduction and IONIS-AGT-LRx had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
 


Our Neurological Medicines in Development
 
Our neurological medicines address a broad range of diseases in major regions of the brain and in the central nervous system, or CNS, cell types. Our antisense medicines aim to address both large and rare patient populations. We are currently investigating potential disease-modifying treatments for common neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. We also have multiple investigational medicines in clinical trials for rare neurological diseases, including ALS and hATTR polyneuropathy. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, or NINDS, at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, a third of the 7,000 known rare diseases are neurological disorders or thought to include a neurological component.

ION363 – See the medicine description under “Our Phase 3 Medicines” section above.
 
Tofersen – See the medicine description under “Our Phase 3 Medicines” section above.
 
ION373 (GFAP) – ION373 is an investigational antisense medicine targeting glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, mRNA we designed to inhibit the production of GFAP. We are developing ION373 as a potential therapy for Alexander disease, or AxD. AxD is a rare progressive and fatal neurological disease that affects the myelin sheath which protects nerve fibers. AxD is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the GFAP gene and is characterized by progressive deterioration, including loss of skills and independence, generally leading to death in childhood or early adulthood.
 
Two major types of AxD have been defined. Type I onset typically occurs before 4 years of age and patients can experience head enlargement, seizures, limb stiffness, delayed or declining cognition, and lack of growth. Type II onset typically occurs after the age of 4 and symptoms can include difficulty speaking, swallowing, and making coordinated movements. AxD is most often fatal. There are treatments that can relieve symptoms, but there is no disease modifying therapy yet available to patients.
 
In April 2021, we initiated a pivotal study of ION373 in patients with AxD. The Phase 2/3 study of ION373 is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study in up to 58 patients with AxD designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ION373. Patients will receive ION373 or placebo for a 60-week period, after which all patients in the study will receive ION373 for a 60-week open-label treatment period. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the 10-Meter Walk Test, or 10MWT.
 
 


IONIS-C9Rx (BIIB078) – IONIS-C9Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to selectively inhibit the production of the mutated chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, or C9ORF72, gene. A mutation in this gene results in an inherited form of ALS, referred to as C9ORF72-ALS, or C9-ALS, the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS worldwide. This mutation can lead to rapid progressive loss of motor neurons and is a fatal disease characterized by muscle weakness, loss of movement, and difficulty breathing and swallowing. IONIS-C9Rx is one of four medicines we have in development to treat ALS.
 
In August 2018, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-C9Rx in adult patients with C9-ALS. The Phase 1/2 study is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess  safety, tolerability and activity of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-C9Rx administered intrathecally.
 
IONIS-C9Rx is being developed under our 2013 Strategic Neurology collaboration with Biogen.
 
IONIS-MAPTRx (BIIB080) – IONIS-MAPTRx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to selectively inhibit production of the microtubule-associated protein tau, or tau, protein in the brain. We are developing IONIS-MAPTRx to treat people with Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain, such as certain forms of frontotemporal degeneration, or FTD, and progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP.
 
AD and FTD are characterized predominantly by memory impairment and behavioral changes, resulting in a person’s inability to independently perform daily activities. PSP is characterized by problems with walking and control of movement, sleep disorder and loss of memory and ability to reason. AD generally occurs late in life and may progress to death in five to 20 years after the onset of the disease. FTD and PSP have a more rapid disease progression. In the U.S., there are approximately five million people living with AD, approximately 55,000 people living with FTD and approximately 20,000 people living with PSP.
 
In July 2021, we and Biogen reported positive topline data from our Phase 1/2 study of IONIS-MAPTRx in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, or AAIC. The Phase 1/2 study was a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation of IONIS-MAPTRx to evaluate the safety and activity of once-monthly intrathecal injections of IONIS-MAPTRx in patients with mild AD. The study showed that IONIS-MAPTRx met its primary objective of safety and tolerability in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease. The study demonstrated robust time and dose dependent lowering of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid over the three-month treatment period and sustained reductions during the six-month post-treatment period and IONIS-MAPTRx had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In December 2019, Biogen exercised its option to license IONIS-MAPTRx. We were responsible for completing the Phase 1/2 study in patients with mild AD and a one-year long-term extension study. Biogen has responsibility for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for IONIS-MAPTRx.
 
ION859 (LRRK2) (BIIB094) – ION859 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2, or LRRK2, protein as a potential therapy for Parkinson’s disease, or PD. The most common genetic mutations in PD are found in the LRRK2 protein. It is believed that increased LRRK2 protein activity could be one of the key drivers for developing PD. PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of neurons in the motor system. Patients with PD can experience tremors, loss of balance and coordination, stiffness, slowing of movement, changes in speech and in some cases cognitive decline. PD is ultimately fatal. There are treatments that can relieve symptoms, but there is no disease modifying therapy.
 
In August 2019, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 study evaluating ION859 in adult patients with PD. The Phase 1/2 study is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of multiple ascending doses of ION859 administered intrathecally.
 
ION859 is being developed under our 2013 Strategic Neurology collaboration with Biogen.
 
ION464 (SNCA) (BIIB101) – ION464 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of the alpha-synuclein protein as a potential therapy for PD, Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA, and related synucleinopathies. Alpha-synuclein protein abnormally accumulates in the brains of PD and MSA patients and is thought to be one of the key drivers of these diseases. It is believed that decreasing the production of the alpha-synuclein protein will reduce the toxic effects of gain-of-function mutations.
 
In July 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 study evaluating ION464 in patients with MSA. The current study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ION464 administered intrathecally.
 
ION464 is being developed under our 2013 Strategic Neurology collaboration with Biogen.
  


ION541 (ATXN2) (BIIB105) – ION541 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to reduce the production of the ataxin-2, or ATXN2, protein for the potential treatment of ALS. The reduction of ATXN2 has been shown to decrease aggregation of TDP-43, a toxic RNA binding protein found in most patients with ALS, including the approximately 90 percent of the ALS population with no known family history of ALS. ION541 is one of four medicines we have in development to treat ALS.
 
In October 2020, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating ION541 in this broad ALS population. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of ION541 administered intrathecally.
 
ION541 is being developed under our 2013 Strategic Neurology collaboration with Biogen.
 
ION582 (UBE3A) (BIIB121) – ION582 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the expression of the UBE3A transcript, or UBE3A-ATS for the potential treatment of Angelman Syndrome, or AS. AS is a rare, genetic neurological disease caused by the loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene. Angelman syndrome typically presents in infancy and is characterized by intellectual disability, balance issues, motor impairment, and debilitating seizures. Some patients are unable to walk or speak. Some symptoms can be managed with existing drugs; however, there is no disease modifying therapy. It is estimated that there are more than 60,000 patients with AS in the U.S. and EU.
 
In December 2021, we initiated the Phase 1/2 study, HALOS, of ION582 in patients with Angelman syndrome. The study is an open label dose-escalation study enrolling up to 44 participants to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of multiple ascending doses of ION582.
 
ION582 is being developed under our 2012 Neurology collaboration with Biogen.
 
Tominersen (HTT) (RG6042) – Tominersen (formerly IONIS-HTTRx) is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to target the underlying cause of Huntington’s disease, or HD, by reducing the production of all forms of the huntingtin protein, or HTT, including its mutated variant, or mHTT. HD is an inherited genetic brain disorder that results in the progressive loss of both mental faculties and physical control. It is caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide sequence in the HTT gene. The resulting mutant HTT protein is toxic and gradually destroys neurons. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50 and worsen over a 10 to 25-year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Presently, there is no effective treatment or cure for the disease, and currently available medicines only mask the patient’s symptoms but do not slow down the underlying loss of neurons.
 
In January 2022, Roche announced plans to initiate a new Phase 2 trial to evaluate tominersen in patients with HD based on findings from a post-hoc analysis of the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study. The findings from the post-hoc analysis suggested tominersen may benefit younger adult patients with lower disease burden. As a result, Roche is in the early stages of designing a Phase 2 clinical trial to explore different doses of tominersen in this patient population.
 
Roche conducted the Phase 3 study, GENERATION HD1,of tominersen in patients with HD. The Phase 3 study was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that recruited 791 participants from 18 countries around the world. In March 2021, Roche announced that dosing would be stopped in the study following a recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee, or iDMC, based on an overall benefit/risk assessment. The study is ongoing without dosing to allow participants to be followed for safety and clinical outcomes. Roche anticipates the study will complete in March/April 2022.
 
Roche is also conducting the GEN-EXTEND study, an OLE study for participants coming from any prior Roche HD study. The study is ongoing without dosing to allow participants to be followed for safety and clinical outcomes. Roche anticipates the study will complete in March/April 2022. In parallel with the OLE, Roche initiated a natural history study in a similar patient population to the OLE aimed at further understanding the natural progression of HD.
 
We completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of tominersen in patients with early-stage HD. In this study, we observed dose-dependent reductions of mHTT among patients treated with tominersen and a favorable safety and tolerability profile supporting continued development. The data from this study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2019.
 
The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted PRIority MEdicines scheme, or PRIME, designation to tominersen. EMA PRIME status is granted to medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. The FDA and EMA granted Orphan Medicine Designation for tominersen to treat people with HD.
 
In December 2017, Roche exercised its option to license tominersen. As a result, Roche is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for tominersen.
  


IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx (DYN101) – IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of Dynamin 2, or DNM2, protein for the treatment of centronuclear myopathy, or CNM. CNM is a group of rare, potentially fatal disorders of the skeletal muscle cells. It is characterized by muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone and muscle atrophy, ranging from severe to mild, and potentially life-threatening. DNM2 reduction demonstrated improved muscle mass and muscle force, and extended lifespan in animal models of the most severe form of CNM.
 
In November 2019, Dynacure initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx in patients with CNM. The current study is an open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx administered intravenously.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we licensed IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx to Dynacure. As a result, Dynacure is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx.
 
Specialty Rare Medicines in Development
 
Our emerging specialty rare disease pipeline is comprised of medicines that are outside of our cardiovascular and neurological franchises, but we believe could represent a compelling opportunity for us.
Sapablursen (TMPRSS6) – Sapablursen (formerly IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to target the TMPRSS6 gene to modulate the production of hepcidin, which is the key regulator of iron homeostasis. By modulating hepcidin expression, sapablursen has the potential to positively impact diseases characterized by iron excess, such as β-thalassemia, and iron deficiency, such as polycythemia vera, or PV.
 

β-thalassemia is a rare, genetic and potentially fatal form of chronic anemia resulting in hepcidin deficiency, severely reduced red blood cell production and iron toxicity. In some cases, iron accumulates in major organs, such as the heart and liver, which can be fatal. The current standard-of-care involves symptom management, including blood transfusions and iron chelation. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for β-thalassemia.
 
PV is a rare, non-genetic and potentially fatal disease caused by overproduction of red blood cells. This overproduction leads to a thickening of the blood, which increases patients’ risk of life-threatening blood clots, including in the lungs, heart and brain. Patients with PV also experience severe iron deficiency due to hepcidin overexpression. The current standard-of-care for PV involves symptom management. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for PV.
 
 In August 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating sapablursen in patients with non-transfusion dependent, or NTDT, β-thalassemia intermedia. The Phase 2 study is multi-center, randomized, open-label study in approximately 36 patients we designed assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sapablursen administered monthly subcutaneously. The primary endpoint is the percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to 1.0 g/dl increase from baseline in hemoglobin at week 27.
 
In January 2022 we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating sapablursen in patients with Phlebotomy Dependent Polycythemia Vera, or PD-PV. The Phase 2 study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label study in approximately 40 patients designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sapablursen. The primary endpoint is Change in the frequency of phlebotomy comparing baseline with the last 20 weeks of the 37-week treatment period.
 
In December 2018, we presented positive data from our Phase 1 study of sapablursen in healthy volunteers at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. The Phase 1 study demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of serum iron and serum transferrin saturation with sapablursen. Additionally, we observed an increase in serum hepcidin and predicted changes in hemoglobin and sapablursen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
 


Cimdelirsen (GHR) – Cimdelirsen (formerly IONIS-GHR-LRx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of growth hormone receptor, or GHr, to decrease the circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1. Elevated levels of IGF-1 results in acromegaly, a chronic, slowly progressing and potentially fatal disease. Patients with acromegaly experience multiple chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory complications and premature death. Current treatments to block IGF-1 are often unsuccessful. Drug treatments to normalize IGF-1 levels are also available but are associated with potentially serious side effects.
 
In January 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 study of cimdelirsen evaluating cimdelirsen as a monotherapy in patients with acromegaly. The Phase 2 study is a multi-center, randomized, open label study in approximately 40 patients to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cimdelirsen. The primary endpoint is the percent change from baseline in IGF-1 to week 27.
 
We completed a Phase 2 study evaluating cimdelirsen as an add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled acromegaly despite stable therapy with long-acting somatostatin receptor ligands, or SRL. Based on the results of this Phase 2 study and a preliminary analysis of the ongoing open-label study, proof of mechanism was achieved with a strong indication of proof of concept supporting the continued development of cimdelirsen. Due to enrollment difficulties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the study closed early, resulting in smaller cohort sizes than planned. While no longer powered to assess the primary endpoint (percentage of IGF- lowering at Day 141) in accordance with the protocol, the study did permit placebo-controlled evaluation of safety and efficacy. Cimdelirsen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
We also completed a Phase 1, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of cimdelirsen in healthy volunteers. In this study, cimdelirsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile supporting continued development.
 
Other Medicines in Development
 
We continue to advance other medicines in clinical development targeting metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, renal diseases, ophthalmic diseases and cancer.
 

*China Only
 
ION224 (DGAT) – ION224 is an investigational LICA medicine designed to reduce the production of DGAT2, or diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, to treat patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. NASH is a common liver disease characterized by liver steatosis, inflammation and scarring and can lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation and early death. DGAT2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis in the liver. Reducing the production of DGAT2 should therefore decrease triglyceride synthesis in the liver. In animal studies, antisense inhibition of DGAT2 significantly improved liver steatosis, lowered blood lipid levels and reversed diet-induced insulin resistance.
 
NASH is sometimes considered a “silent” liver disease because people with early-stage NASH feel well, even though they are starting to accumulate fat in their livers and may not be aware that they have the disease. However, NASH can develop into more severe diseases such as liver cirrhosis and liver failure. Currently, liver transplant is the only therapeutic option for patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, NASH has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of liver cancer.
 
 


Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, describes the full spectrum of liver disease progression from fatty liver to NASH to cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH epidemiology studies have estimated 13 to 32 percent of the global population has NAFLD, 1.5 to 6.5 percent have NASH, and approximately 9 percent of NASH patients progress to advanced liver disease. There are currently no commercially available medications to treat NASH.
 
In June 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 study of ION224 in patients with confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The Phase 2 study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study enrolling approximately 150 patients designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of multiple subcutaneous doses of ION224 on NASH histologic improvement.
 
Bepirovirsen (HBV) (GSK3228836) – Bepirovirsen (formerly IONIS-HBVRx) is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of viral proteins associated with hepatitis B virus, or HBV. These include proteins associated with infection and replication, including the hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, which is present in both acute and chronic infections and is associated with a poor prognosis in people with chronic HBV infection.
 
HBV infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world. Currently available therapies, although effective in reducing circulating HBV in the blood, do not effectively inhibit HBV antigen production and secretion, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of liver cancer.
 
GSK is conducting a broad Phase 2 program for bepirovirsen. The B-Clear study is a Phase 2b randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 440 patients with chronic HBV. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving HBV surface antigen and HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantitation. Additionally, GSK is conducting two open label Phase 2 studies and a long-term follow up study in patients with chronic HBV.
 
In November 2019, GSK reported results of the Phase 2a study of bepirovirsen in patients with chronic HBV infection at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting. In the Phase 2a study, bepirovirsen demonstrated target engagement with dose dependent declines in HBsAg with up to 3-log reductions in HBsAg at one month, including two patients who achieved reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA below levels of detection. Additionally, bepirovirsen had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In August 2019, GSK exercised its option to license our HBV program following the positive Phase 2 results described above. As a result, GSK is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for the HBV program.
 
IONIS-FB-LRx – IONIS-FB-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of complement factor B, or FB. Genetic association studies have shown that overaction of this cascade has been associated with the development of several complement-mediated diseases, including IgA nephropathy, or IgAN, and dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD.
 
IgAN is one of the most common causes of inflammation that impairs the filtering ability of kidneys and is an important cause of chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Also known as Berger’s disease, IgAN is characterized by deposits of IgA in the kidneys, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage.
 
AMD is the leading cause of central vision loss in developed countries. It is estimated that the disease will affect more than three million people in the U.S. by 2026. AMD is believed to be a systemic disease with local disease manifestation at the aging retinal macula. AMD gradually destroys vision in the center of the visual field due to progressive damage of the retina. Geographic atrophy, or GA, is an advanced form of AMD and accounts for approximately fifteen percent of all patients with cases of AMD.
 
In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 study of IONIS-FB-LRx in patients with IgA nephropathy. The Phase 2 study is a single-arm, open-label study designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IONIS-FB-LRx administered subcutaneously in adults with primary IgA nephropathy. The primary endpoint is the percent reduction in 24-hour urine protein excretion from baseline to week 29.
 
In May 2017, we reported data from a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in 54 healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study. Subjects were treated with a single dose of IONIS-FB-LRx achieved dose-dependent reductions in plasma FB of up to 50 percent. Treatment with multiple doses of IONIS-FB-LRx during a six-week period resulted in greater reductions in circulating FB levels. IONIS-FB-LRx had a favorable safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
 


In June 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in patients with GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The study is a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-FB-LRx administered subcutaneously in adults with GA. The primary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in GA area at week 49.
 
IONIS-FB-LRx is being developed under our collaboration with Roche.
 
IONIS-GCGRRx – IONIS-GCGRRx is an investigational antisense medicine designed to inhibit the production of the glucagon receptor, or GCGR, to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. GCGR is a receptor for the hormone glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates the liver to produce glucose, particularly in type 2 diabetes. In patients with advanced diabetes, uncontrolled glucagon action can lead to significant increase in blood glucose level. In addition, reducing GCGR produces more active glucagon-like peptide, or GLP-1, a hormone that preserves pancreatic function and enhances insulin secretion.
 
Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the blood glucose levels are too high. Although glucose is an important source of energy for your body and is vital to your health, uncontrolled increases in glucose can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes. Diabetes is separated into type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the more common type, the body does not respond properly to insulin and, therefore, blood glucose levels are not adequately controlled.
 
In October 2019, Suzhou-Ribo initiated a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating IONIS-GCGRRx in patients with type 2 diabetes.
 
ION357 (RHO) (QR-1123) – ION357 (formerly IONIS-RHO-2.5Rx), is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to treat patients with a genetic form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa by inhibiting the production of the rhodopsin P23H mutant protein in the eye while allowing normal protein to be expressed.
 
Retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, is a group of rare inherited eye disorders causing photoreceptor degeneration that leads to progressive vision loss. Photoreceptors are cells in the eye’s retina responsible for converting light into signals that are sent to the brain. Photoreceptors provide us our color and night vision. Affected patients first experience defective dark adaptation during adolescence or young adulthood, followed by loss of peripheral visual field. Patients eventually have limited residual central vision, which ultimately leads to complete blindness around the age of 60.
 
In November 2019, ProQR initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating ION357 in patients with RP. The Phase 1/2 study is a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of ION357 in adult patients with RP.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we licensed ION357 to ProQR. As a result, ProQR is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for ION357.
 
ION736 (FOXP3) (AZD8701) – ION736, is an investigational antisense medicine designed to reduce the production of Forkhead Box P3, or FOXP3, for the treatment of patients with cancer. FOXP3 is a protein involved in the function of immuno-suppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs). Tregs, which are found at high levels in various types of cancers, often predict poor survival and poor response to immune checkpoint therapeutics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that FOXP3 downregulation resulted in an increased immune response and anti-tumor activity. Moreover, the combination of antisense inhibition of FOXP3 with other immuno-oncology drugs led to enhanced anti-tumor activity.
 
In August 2020, AstraZeneca initiated a first-in-human open label study of ION736 in patients with select advanced solid tumors. The study is a multi-center, open label multi-arm study in approximately 123 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ION736 administered intravenously as monotherapy and in combination with durvaluamb (MEDI4736) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
 
In the second quarter of 2020, we licensed ION736 to AstraZeneca. As a result, AstraZeneca is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for ION736.
 
 


IONIS-AR-2.5Rx – IONIS-AR-2.5Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to treat people with prostate cancer by reducing the production of all known forms of androgen receptor, or AR, including variants of the AR gene. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Prostate cancer growth, proliferation and progression are all androgen-dependent and AR function is involved in disease progression at all stages of prostate cancer. For patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the androgen receptor or removing circulating androgens. Resistance to current therapies is frequent.
 
An open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-AR-2.5Rx was completed in people with advanced tumors for which the androgen receptor pathway is potentially a contributing factor. The study was primarily conducted in prostate cancer patients, and it showed durable responses in a number of those patients. IONIS-AR-2.5Rx had a safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In March 2017, we licensed IONIS-AR-2.5Rx to Suzhou-Ribo to develop and commercialize the medicine in China. In the third quarter of 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Flamingo Therapeutics for the development and commercialization of certain programs from Ionis’ oncology pipeline, including IONIS-AR-2.5Rx outside of China.
 
Danvatirsen (STAT3) – Danvatirsen (formerly IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx) is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, or STAT3, to treat people with cancer. STAT3 is a protein involved in the translation of key factors critical for tumor cell growth and survival. STAT3 is over-active in a variety of cancers, including brain, lung, breast, bone, liver, and multiple myeloma. Overactivity in STAT3 prevents cancer cell death and promotes tumor cell growth.
 
In October 2018, we reported data from a Phase 1/2 study of danvatirsen in combination with durvalumab in recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer. The combination treatment resulted in seven percent of patients achieving a complete tumor response and 23 percent achieving either a partial or complete tumor response. This response rate is estimated to be double that with durvalumab alone, based on previous studies in this difficult to treat patient population. Danvatirsen had a safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.
 
In the third quarter of 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Flamingo Therapeutics for the development and commercialization of certain programs from Ionis’ oncology pipeline, including danvatirsen.
 
Phase 1 Medicines in Clinical Development
 
Our early-stage pipeline is comprised of medicines to treat a number of diseases, including from our cardiovascular franchise. It includes medicines based on our latest technology advancements. As we continue to add new investigational medicines to our pipeline, we believe these medicines have the potential to expand our mid and late-stage pipelines.
Antisense Technology
 
Our antisense technology is an innovative platform for discovering first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines. Antisense medicines target RNA, the intermediary that conveys genetic information from a gene to the protein synthesis machinery in the cell. By targeting RNA instead of proteins, we can use antisense technology to increase, decrease or alter the production of specific proteins. The unique properties of antisense technology provide several advantages over other drug discovery technologies.
 
These advantages include:
 

● | Direct intervention in the disease process at the genetic level by targeting RNA: antisense technology represents a direct route from gene to drug. The explosion in genomic information and RNA biology has led to the discovery of many new disease-causing proteins and RNAs and has created new opportunities that are uniquely accessible by antisense technology. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Precise specificity: we design antisense medicines to target a single RNA, minimizing the possibility of binding to unintended targets, which can cause unwanted side effects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Good drug properties: antisense medicines distribute well throughout the body. They also have a long half-life, in the range of weeks to months, which means patients and/or healthcare providers can dose our medicines weekly, monthly or even less frequently depending on the medicine and target tissue. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to combine with other medicines: because antisense medicines do not interact with the enzymes that metabolize or break down other medicines, physicians can use our medicines in combination with other medicines. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms: there are virtually no “undruggable” targets with antisense technology. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient discovery and early development: because of the efficiency of our antisense technology, our drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We develop antisense medicines we believe will pioneer new markets and change standards of care. Our areas of focus include cardiovascular and neurological diseases.
 
Technology Overview
 
We use our core technology platform to discover and develop medicines that affect targets in the body at the genetic level. Genes contain the information necessary to produce proteins. A gene is made up of nucleotides containing the nucleoside bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, commonly known as A, T, G and C, which are linked together to form a two-stranded structure that resembles a twisted ladder, known as DNA. The nucleotides on one side of the ladder bind weakly to complementary nucleotides on the other strand according to specific rules; for example, A pairs with T and G pairs with C, creating the ladder’s rungs (Figure 1). Scientists call this highly specific nucleotide pairing hybridization. The sequence or order of these nucleotides establishes the cell’s recipes for making proteins. Each protein’s instructions reside in a corresponding segment of DNA known as a gene.
  


Figure 1: Illustration of DNA.
 
The instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA, into a different genetic molecule called messenger RNA. This process starts with the partial uncoiling of the two complementary strands of the DNA. One strand acts as a template and information stored in the DNA template strand is copied into a complementary RNA (Figure 2) by an enzyme called RNA polymerase, or RNAP. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, are mature, fully processed RNA that code for proteins.
 
Figure 2: Transcription of information contained in a gene, or DNA, to RNA.
 
 


Ribosomes, the cell’s factories for manufacturing proteins, translate mRNA into proteins. The ribosome reads the encoded information, the mRNA’s nucleotide sequence, and in doing so, strings together amino acids to form a specific protein (Figure 3).
 
Figure 3: Translation of the protein-coding information contained in mRNA to protein.
 
We primarily use our antisense technology to interrupt the cell’s protein production process by preventing the mRNA instructions from reaching the ribosome, thus inhibiting the production of the protein. We can also design antisense medicines to increase protein production for diseases caused by the lack of a particular protein or modify the processing (or splicing) of the mRNA, which can alter the composition of the protein. The mRNA sequence of nucleotides that carries the information for protein production is called the ‘sense’ strand. Scientists call the complementary nucleotide chain that binds specifically to the sense strand the “antisense” strand. We use the information contained in mRNA to design chemical structures, that we call antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, or antisense medicines, which resemble DNA and RNA and are the complement of RNA. Our antisense medicines bind with high selectivity to the mRNA they were designed to target. Since each mRNA codes for a specific protein, we can design antisense medicines that selectively inhibit the disease-causing member of a protein family without interfering with other members of the protein family that might be necessary for normal cellular or bodily functions. This unique specificity means that antisense medicines may be less toxic than traditional medicines because we can design them to minimize the impact on unintended targets.
 
We have developed the majority of the medicines in our pipeline using our advanced screening methods to produce medicines with what we believe have strong safety and tolerability profiles. We continue to advance our antisense technology to create even more potent medicines that we can use in more tissues and against more targets. These advances allow us to expand the mechanisms through which we can use our medicines and provide us with greater opportunities to use our antisense medicines to treat a greater number of diseases and reach more patients. Today our medicines and those entering our pipeline utilize our key technology advances, including our Generation 2.5 and our LICA technology.
 
Generation 2.5 chemistry, used in several medicines in our pipeline, enables up to 10-fold greater potency compared to our medicines using our earlier chemistries. This increased potency enables broad distribution throughout the body and target engagement to multiple tissues including liver, kidney, lung, muscle, adipose, adrenal gland, peripheral nerves and tumor tissues.
 
 


LICA is a chemical technology we developed that involves attaching a molecule called a ligand that binds with receptors on the surfaces of cells in a highly specific manner. Because these receptors are often found only on certain cell types, LICA allows us to increase effective delivery of our antisense medicines with higher specificity to certain cell types that express these receptors relative to non-conjugated antisense medicines. As of December 2021, we have an integrated assessment of data from multiple LICA medicines and clinical programs which demonstrates that our LICA technology for liver targets can increase potency by 20-30-fold over our non-LICA antisense medicines.
 
In addition to the increase in potency, our LICA platform has consistently demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability. Pelacarsen exemplifies these improvements. We designed this medicine to reduce the production of Apo(a) protein in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing Lp(a). Pelacarsen was the first medicine to selectively and robustly reduce Lp(a) levels below threshold levels associated with CVD in nearly all patients and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the Phase 2 study. The study included more than 280 patients, with 98 percent of patients in the high dose group achieving levels below 50 mg/dL, the recognized risk threshold for CVD.
 
We can also combine our LICA technology with our Generation 2.5 chemistry, further increasing potency. In addition to the LICA technology for liver targets, we are also developing LICA conjugation technology that we can use to target other tissues, such as pancreas and muscle, and initial results in animals are promising.
 
Antisense Targets and Mechanisms
 
There are more than a dozen different antisense mechanisms that we can utilize with our antisense technology. The majority of the medicines in our pipeline bind to mRNAs and inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins. However, our antisense technology is broadly applicable to many different antisense mechanisms, including modulation of RNA splicing, RNA interference, or RNAi, and enhancing protein translation to increase protein production.
 
When using antisense technology to inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins or reduce levels of harmful RNAs, our antisense medicines bind to the target RNA via highly specific nucleotide pairing, or hybridization, and recruit a cellular enzyme called ribonuclease H1, or RNase H1, to degrade the target RNA. The antisense medicine itself remains intact during this process, so it can remain active against additional target RNA molecules and repeatedly trigger their degradation (Figure 4). Examples of our antisense medicines that use the RNase H1 mechanism to reduce disease protein production include, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen, tofersen and others.
 
Figure 4: Antisense medicine using the RNase H mechanism of action.
  


SPINRAZA is an example of an antisense medicine that modulates RNA splicing to increase protein production of the SMN protein (Figure 5), which is critical to the health and survival of nerve cells in the spinal cord that are responsible for neuro-muscular function. The SMN protein is deficient in people with SMA.
 
Figure 5: Antisense medicine altering splicing of the SMN2 mRNA.
 
We are also making progress in designing antisense medicines to target long, non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs and RNAs that possess a toxic function in human diseases. Many of these RNAs, such as lncRNAs, do not make proteins but often cause disease by regulating the function of other genes or proteins. In 2014, we published a paper in Nature in which we were the first to show that targeted reduction of a lncRNA with an antisense compound can ameliorate certain cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, or AS. In 2021, we initiated the HALOS study, a Phase 1/2a study of ION582 in patients with AS.
 
Because the efficiency of our core technology platform can support multiple target-based antisense research programs, we can develop antisense medicines to target a broad range of diseases, efficiently producing a large and broad proprietary portfolio of medicines. We are currently pursuing antisense drug discovery programs focused on neurological, cardiovascular, and other diseases.
 
Collaborative Arrangements
 
 We have established alliances with a cadre of leading global pharmaceutical companies. Our partners include the following companies, among others: AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Novartis, and Roche. Through our partnerships, we have earned both commercial revenue and a broad and sustaining base of R&D revenue in the form of license fees, upfront payments and milestone payments. In 2021, we recognized $810 million in revenue, the majority of which was from our partnered medicines and programs. We have the potential to earn more than $24 billion in future milestone payments, licensing fees and other payments from our current partnerships. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to mid-20 percent royalties under certain partnerships. Below, we include the significant terms of our collaboration agreements.

2013 Strategic Neurology
 
In September 2013, we and Biogen entered into a long-term strategic relationship focused on applying antisense technology to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. As part of the collaboration, Biogen gained exclusive rights to the use of our antisense technology to develop therapies for neurological diseases and has the option to license medicines resulting from this collaboration. We will usually be responsible for drug discovery and early development of antisense medicines and Biogen will have the option to license antisense medicines after Phase 2 proof-of-concept. In October 2016, we expanded our collaboration to include additional research activities we will perform. If Biogen exercises its option to license a medicine, it will assume global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities and costs for that medicine. We are currently advancing six investigational medicines in development under this collaboration, including a medicine for Parkinson’s disease, three medicines for ALS, a medicine for multiple system atrophy and a medicine for an undisclosed target. In December 2018, Biogen exercised its option to license our most advanced ALS medicine, tofersen, and as a result Biogen is now responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for tofersen.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $100 million and are eligible to receive milestone payments, license fees and royalty payments for all medicines developed under this collaboration, with the specific amounts dependent upon the modality of the molecule advanced by Biogen. For each antisense molecule that is chosen for drug discovery and development under this collaboration, we are eligible to receive up to approximately $260 million in a license fee and milestone payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on net sales from any product that Biogen successfully commercializes under this collaboration. Through December 2021, we have generated over $280 million under this collaboration, including $10 million we received from Biogen in 2021 when Biogen advanced ION541, an investigational medicine targeting ATXN2 to treat patients with ALS.
  
2012 Neurology
 
In December 2012, we and Biogen entered into a collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize novel antisense medicines to treat neurodegenerative diseases. We are responsible for the development of each of the medicines through the completion of the initial Phase 2 clinical study for such medicine. Biogen has the option to license a medicine from each of the programs through the completion of the first Phase 2 study for each program. Under this collaboration, we are currently advancing IONIS-MAPTRx for Alzheimer’s disease and ION582 for AS. If Biogen exercises its option to license a medicine, it will assume global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities and costs for that medicine. In December 2019, Biogen exercised its option to license IONIS-MAPTRx and as a result Biogen is now responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for IONIS-MAPTRx.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30 million. Over the term of the collaboration, we are eligible to receive up to $210 million in a license fee and milestone payments per program, plus a mark-up on the cost estimate of the Phase 1 and 2 studies. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on net sales from any product that Biogen successfully commercializes under this collaboration. Through December 2021, we have generated over $165 million under our collaboration, including $10 million we received from Biogen for advancing ION582 during 2021.
  
Joint Development and Commercialization Arrangement
 
AstraZeneca
 
Eplontersen Collaboration
 
In December 2021, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize eplontersen for the treatment of ATTR. We are jointly developing and preparing to commercialize eplontersen with AstraZeneca in the U.S. AstraZeneca obtained exclusive rights to commercialize eplontersen outside the U.S., except certain countries in Latin America. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $200 million upfront payment. We are eligible to receive up to $485 million in development and approval milestones, and up to $2.9 billion in sales-related milestone payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to mid-20 percent royalties for sales in the U.S. and tiered royalties up to the high teens for sales outside the U.S.
 
The collaboration also includes territory-specific development, commercial and medical affairs cost-sharing provisions. AstraZeneca will pay 55 percent of the costs associated with the ongoing global Phase 3 development program. As we will continue to lead the Phase 3 development program, we will recognize as revenue the 55 percent of cost-share funding AstraZeneca is responsible for in the same period we incur the related development expenses. As AstraZeneca is responsible for the majority of the commercial and medical affairs costs in the U.S. and all costs associated with bringing eplontersen to market outside the U.S., we will recognize cost-share funding we receive from AstraZeneca related to these activities as a reduction of our commercial and medical affairs expenses. Through December 2021, we have generated $200 million in payments under this collaboration.
  


Research and Development Partners
 
AstraZeneca
 
In addition to our collaboration for eplontersen, we have two other collaborations with AstraZeneca. One is focused on the treatment of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases and the other is focused on the treatment of oncology diseases. We and AstraZeneca are currently developing six medicines under these collaborations. From inception through December 2021, we have generated nearly $425 million from our AstraZeneca research and development collaborations.

AstraZeneca is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for ION736.
  
Under the terms of this agreement, we received $31 million in upfront payments. We are eligible to receive license fees and milestone payments of up to more than $265 million as this collaboration advances. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the low teens on net sales from any product that AstraZeneca successfully commercializes under this collaboration agreement. Through December 2021, we have generated over $140 million in payments under this collaboration, including $13 million we earned in 2020 when AstraZeneca licensed ION736.
  
 Bayer

 
 In May 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Bayer to develop and commercialize IONIS-FXIRx for the prevention of thrombosis and we received a $100 million upfront payment. In February 2017, we amended our agreement with Bayer to advance IONIS-FXIRx and to initiate development of fesomersen (formerly IONIS-FXI-LRx), which Bayer licensed. In conjunction with the amendment, we received a $75 million payment. In October 2019, Bayer decided to advance fesomersen following positive clinical results. Bayer is now responsible for all global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for the FXI program. We are eligible to receive additional milestone payments as the FXI program advances toward the market. Over the term of the collaboration, we are eligible to receive up to $385 million in license fees, milestone payments and other payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low to high 20 percent range on gross margins of both medicines combined. Through December 2021, we have generated over $190 million under this collaboration.
GSK
 
In March 2010, we entered into an alliance with GSK using our antisense drug discovery platform to discover and develop new medicines against targets for serious and rare diseases, including infectious diseases and some conditions causing blindness. Under the collaboration, we received upfront payments of $35 million. Our collaboration with GSK covers bepirovirsen, an investigational antisense medicine we designed to reduce the production of viral proteins associated with HBV infection. In 2019, following positive Phase 2 results, GSK licensed our HBV program. GSK is responsible for all global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for the HBV program.
 
Under our agreement, if GSK successfully develops bepirovirsen and achieves pre-agreed sales targets, we could receive license fees and milestone payments of more than $260 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on net sales from any product that GSK successfully commercializes under this alliance. Through December 2021, we have generated over $185 million in payments under our collaboration.
  
 


 Novartis


In January 2017, we initiated a collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize pelacarsen. We received a $75 million upfront payment in February 2017. In February 2019, Novartis licensed pelacarsen and we earned a $150 million license fee. Novartis is responsible for conducting and funding future development and regulatory activities for pelacarsen, including a global Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study, which Novartis initiated in December 2019. In connection with Novartis’ license of pelacarsen, we and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which the companies would negotiate the co-commercialization of pelacarsen in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize pelacarsen in exchange for Novartis paying us increased sales milestone payments based on sales of pelacarsen.
 
Under the collaboration, we are eligible to receive up to $675 million in milestone payments related to pelacarsen. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low 20 percent range on net sales of pelacarsen. Through December 2021, we have generated nearly $425 million under our collaboration including an upfront payment, license fee, milestone payments and other payments from this collaboration, including a $25 million milestone payment we earned in 2021 when Novartis achieved 50 percent enrollment in the Lp(a) HORIZON Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study of pelacarsen.
 
In conjunction with this collaboration, we entered into a SPA with Novartis. As part of the SPA, Novartis purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $100 million in the first quarter of 2017.
 
Roche
  
Huntington’s Disease
  
 In April 2013, we formed an alliance with Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., collectively Roche, to develop treatments for HD based on our antisense technology. Under the agreement, we discovered and developed tominersen, an investigational medicine targeting HTT protein. We developed tominersen through completion of our Phase 1/2 clinical study in people with early stage HD. In December 2017, upon completion of the Phase 1/2 study, Roche exercised its option to license tominersen and is now responsible for the global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for tominersen. In March 2021, Roche discontinued dosing in the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen in patients with manifest Huntington’s disease based on the results of a pre-planned review of data from the Phase 3 study conducted by an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee. In January 2022, Roche announced it is actively preparing to initiate a new Phase 2 study of tominersen in patients with HD. Post-hoc analyses from the GENERATION HD1 study suggested tominersen may benefit younger adult patients with lower disease burden.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30 million in April 2013. We are eligible to receive up to $365 million in a license fee and milestone payments as tominersen advances. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $136.5 million in milestone payments for each additional medicine successfully developed. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on net sales from any product resulting from this alliance. Through December 2021, we have generated $150 million under our collaboration.


IONIS-FB-LRx for Complement-Mediated Diseases
 
In October 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Roche to develop IONIS-FB-LRx for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. We are currently conducting Phase 2 studies in two disease indications for IONIS-FB-LRx, one for the treatment of patients with GA, the advanced stage of dry AMD, and a second for the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy. Roche has the option to license IONIS-FB-LRx at the completion of these studies. Upon licensing, Roche will be responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs.
 
Under the terms of this agreement, we received a $75 million upfront payment in October 2018. We are eligible to receive more than $680 million including a license fee and milestone payments. In addition, we are also eligible to receive tiered royalties from the high teens to twenty percent on net sales. Through December 2021, we have generated over $75 million under our collaboration.
  
 


Commercialization Partnerships
 
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Sobi)
 
We began commercializing TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Europe in January 2021 and TEGSEDI in North America in April 2021 through distribution agreements with Sobi. Under our agreements, we are responsible for supplying finished goods inventory to Sobi and Sobi is responsible for selling each medicine to the end customer. In exchange, we earn a distribution fee on net sales from Sobi for each medicine.
 
PTC Therapeutics
 
In August 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with PTC Therapeutics to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. Under the license agreement, we are eligible to receive royalties from PTC in the mid-20 percent range on net sales for each medicine. In December 2021, we started receiving royalties from PTC for TEGSEDI sales.
  
Technology Enhancement Collaboration
 
Bicycle License Agreement
 
In December 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bicycle and obtained an option to license its peptide technology to potentially increase the delivery capabilities of our LICA medicines. In July 2021, we paid $42 million when we exercised our option to license Bicycle’s technology, which included an equity investment in Bicycle. As part of our stock purchase, we entered into a lockup agreement with Bicycle that restricts our ability to trade our Bicycle shares for one year. In 2021, we recorded a $7 million equity investment for the shares we received in Bicycle. We recognized the remaining $35 million as R&D expense in 2021. From inception through December 2021, we have paid Bicycle $47 million under this collaboration agreement.
Other Agreements

 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Under the terms of our agreement with Alnylam, we co-exclusively (with ourselves) licensed to Alnylam our patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics, with Alnylam having the exclusive right to grant platform sublicenses for double-stranded RNAi.  In exchange for such rights, Alnylam gave us a technology access fee, participation in fees from Alnylam’s partnering programs, as well as future milestone and royalty payments from Alnylam. We retained exclusive rights to our patents for single-stranded antisense therapeutics and for a limited number of double-stranded RNAi therapeutic targets and all rights to single-stranded RNAi, or ssRNAi, therapeutics. In turn, Alnylam nonexclusively licensed to us its patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, ssRNAi therapeutics, and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. We also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi therapeutics targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a nonexclusive basis. Additionally, in 2015, we and Alnylam entered into an alliance in which we cross-licensed intellectual property. Under this alliance, we and Alnylam each obtained exclusive license rights to four therapeutic programs. Alnylam granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to its chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four targets, including FXI and Apo(a) and two other targets. In exchange, we granted Alnylam an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four other targets. Alnylam also granted us a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for single-stranded antisense therapeutics. In turn, we granted Alnylam a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed an arbitration process with Alnylam. The arbitration panel awarded us $41 million for payments owed to us by Alnylam related to Alnylam’s agreement with Sanofi Genzyme. We recognized the $41 million payment from Alnylam as R&D revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.
 
The Ludwig Institute; Center for Neurological Studies

 
 We have a collaboration with the Ludwig Institute, the Center for Neurological Studies and researchers to discover and develop antisense medicines for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Under this agreement, we agreed to pay the Ludwig Institute and the Center for Neurological Studies modest milestone payments and royalties on any antisense medicines resulting from the collaboration.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture most of the drug product we use for our research and development activities ourselves. We have also manufactured API and commercial supply for our approved medicines. We have dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since we can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide medicines, we found that the same techniques we used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide medicine could help improve the manufacturing processes for our other antisense medicines. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up our manufacturing capabilities, we have greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide medicines. For example, we have significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing our capacity to make our medicines. Through both our internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors we may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions.
 
Our manufacturing facility is located in a 26,800 square foot building in Carlsbad, California. We purchased this building in 2017. In addition, we have a 25,800 square foot building that houses support functions for our manufacturing activities. We lease this facility under a lease that has a term ending in August 2026 with an option to extend the lease for an additional five-year period. Our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign equivalents to ensure that it is operating in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements.
 
As part of our collaborations we may agree to manufacture clinical trial materials and/or commercial supply for our partners. For example, in the past we have manufactured clinical supply materials for AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK and Novartis and commercial supply materials for Biogen.
 
We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity at our own facility or at contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to meet our current internal research, development and potential commercial needs, as well as our obligations under existing agreements with our partners for research, development and commercial material. As we continue to advance our wholly owned medicines through Phase 3 development, we will begin to manufacture process performance qualification batches and pre-approval inspection batches of our Phase 3 medicines that may be used for regulatory submissions and, pending regulatory approval, commercial sale. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity and diversify our supply chain. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, it is possible that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, could result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also could experience a disruption in supply from our current CMO partners.
 
CMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMO partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 
Specifically, we have the following in place for our approved medicines, SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA and our medicines in Phase 3 development: eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen and tofersen.
 
SPINRAZA
 
Biogen is responsible for SPINRAZA drug supply.
 
TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA
 
For TEGSEDI’s commercial drug supply, we are using CMOs to produce custom raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished goods. For WAYLIVRA’s commercial drug supply, we have manufactured custom raw materials and API. We are using CMOs to produce the finished goods for WAYLIVRA. Our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise and cGMP experience. We believe our we and our current network of CMO partners are capable of manufacturing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands.
Eplontersen
 
Our CMO partner supplied the API and the finished drug product for eplontersen’s Phase 3 program. Pursuant to our collaboration with AstraZeneca, we will manufacture and supply eplontersen through a CMO for the ongoing clinical trials and process qualifications. AstraZeneca is responsible for commercial supply.
Olezarsen, Donidalorsen, ION363
 
We have supplied the API and the finished drug product for olezarsen, donidalorsen and ION363 that we believe will be sufficient through the completion of the Phase 3 programs for each medicine. We plan to leverage our relationships with CMOs to procure long-term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices in the future.
Pelacarsen
 
We supplied the API and the finished drug product for pelacarsen’s Phase 3 study. Pursuant to our collaboration with Novartis, Novartis is responsible for any further pelacarsen drug supply.
Tofersen
 
We manufactured the first batch of API for tofersen in 2015 to support the first in human studies under our collaboration agreement with Biogen. Pursuant to our collaboration with Biogen, Biogen is responsible for tofersen drug supply. Biogen has an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility that gives it the capability to manufacture tofersen for all subsequent clinical studies and potential commercialization, including supplying the API for the current Phase 3 study.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products in the U.S. and other countries. We own or have exclusively licensed a substantial patent estate with numerous issued patents worldwide protecting our products and, more generally, our platform for development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. We focus our resources on patents and new patent applications that drive value for our company.
 
We own or control patents that provide exclusivity for products in our pipeline and patents that provide exclusivity for our core technology in the field of antisense more generally. Our core technology patents include claims to chemically modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides as well as antisense medicine designs utilizing these chemically modified nucleosides. These core claims are independent of specific therapeutic target, nucleic acid sequence, or clinical indication. We also own a large number of patents claiming antisense compounds having nucleic acid sequences complementary to therapeutic target nucleic acids, independent of the particular chemical modifications incorporated into the antisense compound. Most importantly, we seek and obtain issued patent claims to specifically protect each of our medicines. For example, we file and seek to obtain claims covering each drug’s nucleic acid sequence and precise drug design. In sum, we maintain our competitive advantage in the field of antisense technology by protecting our core platform technology and by creating multiple layers of patent protection for each of our specific medicines in development.
 

Type of Patent Claim (Broadly Applicable to Specific) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides (target and sequence independent) ● Antisense Drug Design Motifs (target and sequence independent) ● Therapeutic Methods (sequence and chemistry independent) ● Antisense Sequence (chemistry independent) ● Drug Composition 

Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides
 
The most broadly applicable of our patents are those that claim modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides comprising the modified nucleosides that we incorporate into our antisense medicines to increase their therapeutic efficacy. Nucleosides and chemically modified nucleosides are the basic building blocks of our antisense medicines. Therefore claims that cover any oligonucleotide incorporating one of our proprietary modified nucleosides can apply to a wide array of antisense mechanisms of action as well as several therapeutic targets. Of particular note are our patents covering our proprietary 2’-O-(2-methoxy) ethyl, or “MOE,” modified nucleosides, incorporated into many of our second-generation development compounds, as well as our constrained-ethyl nucleosides, or “cEt” nucleosides incorporated into our Generation 2.5 compounds. The following are some of our patents in this category in key jurisdictions (U.S., Europe and Japan):

Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 7,101,993 | OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING 2’-O-MODIFIED PURINES | 2023 | Certain MOE nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleotides
United States | 7,399,845 | 6-MODIFIED BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | cEt nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleoside analogs

United States | 7,569,686 | COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR SYNTHESIS OF BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | Methods of synthesizing cEt nucleosides 

Antisense Drug Design Motifs
 
We also have patents that claim oligonucleotides comprising antisense drug design motifs, or patterns of nucleoside modifications at specified positions in the oligonucleotide. Patent claims covering our antisense drug design motifs are independent of nucleic acid sequence, so they cover oligonucleotides having the recited motif, regardless of cellular target or clinical indication. The claimed motifs generally confer properties that optimize oligonucleotides for a particular antisense mechanism of action, such as ribonuclease H (RNase H), RNAi, or splicing. We have designed oligonucleotides incorporating motifs, which we refer to as chimeric compounds or gapmers, to exploit the RNase H mechanism to achieve target RNA reduction. Almost all of our medicines in clinical development, including TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, but excluding SPINRAZA, contain this gapmer antisense drug design motif. We own a U.S. patent that covers all of our second-generation MOE gapmer antisense medicines until March of 2023.
 
 


In addition, we have patent claims to antisense drug design motifs incorporating bicyclic nucleosides, which include both locked nucleic acids, or “LNA” and cEt. In Europe, we have been granted claims drawn to certain gapmer oligonucleotides with bicyclic nucleosides, which include locked nucleic acids in the wings. We have also successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our Generation 2.5 gapmer antisense drug design motifs that incorporate our cEt modified nucleosides. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category in key jurisdictions (U.S., Europe and Japan):
 

Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States | 10,493,092 | ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS | 2028 | Gapmer oligonucleotides having BNA nucleosides and 2’-MOE nucleosides and/or 2’-OMe nucleosides 
Europe | 3067421 | OLIGOMERIC COMPOUNDS COMPRISING BICYCLIC NUCLEOTIDES AND USES THEREOF | 2032 | Gapmer oligonucleotides having at least one bicyclic, one 2’-modified nucleoside and one 2’-deoxynucleoside 

 
LIgand-Conjugated Antisense (LICA) Technology
 
We also have patent claims to new chemistries created to enhance targeting of antisense medicines to specific tissues and cells to improve a drug’s properties. We designed our GalNAc LICA medicines to provide an increase in potency for targets in the liver. We have successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our LICA technology conjugated to any modified oligonucleotide, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 9,127,276 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Preferred THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides 
United States | 9,181,549 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Preferred THA conjugate having our preferred linker and cleavable moiety conjugated to any oligomeric compound or any nucleoside having a 2’-MOE modification or a cEt modification 
Europe | 2991661 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Preferred THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides 

Therapeutic Methods of Treatment and Antisense Drug Sequences
 
In addition to our broad core patents, we also own hundreds of patents, worldwide, with claims to antisense compounds having particular sequences and compounds directed to particular therapeutically important targets or methods of achieving cellular or clinical endpoints using these antisense compounds. These “Target” patents also include claims reciting the specific nucleic acid sequences utilized by our products, independent of chemical modifications and motifs. In addition, our product-specific patents typically include claims combining specific nucleic acid sequences with nucleoside modifications and motifs. In this way, we seek patent claims narrowly tailored to protect our products specifically, in addition to the broader core antisense patents described above.
  


SPINRAZA and Survival Motor Neuron
 
We believe SPINRAZA is protected from generic competition in the U.S. until at least 2035 and in Europe until at least 2030 by a suite of patents. These issued patents include: (i) patents licensed from the University of Massachusetts drawn to antisense compounds having the sequence of SPINRAZA, independent of chemical modification and uses of such compounds for treating SMA, and (ii) joint patents with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory claiming fully modified 2’MOE compositions targeting SMN2, including the precise composition of matter of SPINRAZA and methods of using such compositions. We have filed for patent term extension, to potentially extend the term beyond 2030. With Biogen’s license of SPINRAZA, we assigned our interest in these patents to Biogen. The table below lists some key issued patents protecting SPINRAZA in the U.S. and Europe:

We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each medicine in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review. The patent exclusivity period for a medicine will prevent generic medicines from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 
 


Manufacturing Patents
 
We also own patents claiming methods of manufacturing and purifying oligonucleotides. These patents claim methods for improving oligonucleotide drug manufacturing, including processes for large-scale oligonucleotide synthesis and purification. These methods allow us to manufacture oligonucleotides at lower cost by, for example, eliminating expensive manufacturing steps.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in antisense therapeutics.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by government authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory authorities, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.
 
Extensive regulation by the U.S. and foreign governmental authorities governs the development, manufacture and sale of our medicines. In particular, our medicines are subject to a number of approval requirements by the FDA in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other laws and by comparable agencies in those foreign countries in which we conduct business. The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our medicines. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and procedures.
 
Our manufacturing facility and our CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new medicine may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
 
The FDA must approve any new medicine before a manufacturer can market it in the U.S. In order to obtain approval, we and our partners must complete clinical studies and prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA. If the FDA approves a medicine, it will issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the medicine and may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure the benefits of the medicine outweigh the potential risks. For example, TEGSEDI has a REMS program. The requirements for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of our medicines. In foreign jurisdictions, the drug approval process is similarly demanding.
 
For any approved medicine, domestic and foreign sales of the medicine depend, in part, on the availability and amount of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private health plans. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product, or procedures which utilize such product. Private health plans may seek to manage cost and use of our medicines by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. For example, third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of U.S. FDA-approved products for a particular indication. In certain jurisdictions, governments may also regulate or influence coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our medicines to control cost or affect use. Within the EU a variety of payers pay for medicines, with governments being the primary source of payment. Negotiating pricing with governmental authorities can delay commercialization. Such pricing and reimbursement factors could impact our ability and that of our commercial partners to successfully commercialize approved medicines. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels and by foreign governments that seek to reduce healthcare costs. There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in efforts to bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medicines. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 


In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulates the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
 
Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, for example, the following:
 

● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Foreign and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the EU; and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, in California, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of medicines, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 
Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements, we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.
 
In the U.S. sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.
 
 


Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
 
Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the E.U. and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our medicines, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity, it can have adverse implications for us.
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. If we violate the FCPA, it could result in large civil and criminal penalties as well as an adverse effect on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. We could also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges.
 
Both the federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. Congress is also considering additional health reform measures. Such legislation and regulations may result in decreased reimbursement, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for medical products.
 
Competition
 
Our Business in General
 
Some of our medicines may compete with existing therapies for market share and some of our medicines in development may compete for patients in clinical trials. In addition, there are a number of companies pursuing the development of oligonucleotide-based technologies and the development of pharmaceuticals utilizing these technologies. These companies include biopharmaceutical companies and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together. Our medicines are differentiated from traditional small molecule medicines by their chemistry, how they move in the body, how they act in the body, delivery technology, and formulations.
 
Our approved medicines and our medicines under development address numerous markets. The diseases our medicines target for which we have or may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. For some of our medicines, an important factor may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop medicines, complete the clinical trials and marketing authorization processes and supply commercial quantities of the medicines to the market are important competitive factors. We expect to compete with products approved for sale based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, product efficacy, safety, mechanism of action, dosing convenience, marketing and sales strategy and tactics, availability, price, and reimbursement.
 
 


Below we have included what we believe to be the competitive landscape for our marketed medicines and for the medicines we currently have in Phase 3 trials. We have included medicines that we believe compete or may compete directly with our medicines. We included competitors, potential competitors that are past Phase 1 development or potential competitors that plan to start a pivotal study this year. We do not believe that any medicines meet these criteria to compete with ION363.

Environmental, Social and Governance Initiatives
 
We recognize the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, initiatives as it relates to our business strategy and risk assessment. During 2020 and 2021, we took steps to formalize our corporate responsibility program. In December 2021, we issued our inaugural corporate responsibility report. As part of our ongoing work, we identified the following corporate responsibility initiatives that we believe are most important to our business:

● | Safety of patients in clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------


● | Drug safety and supply chain management;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Access to medicines and tackling devastating diseases;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Human resources management;
--+----------------------------


● | Diversity, equity and inclusion;
--+---------------------------------


● | Employee health and safety; and
--+--------------------------------


● | Governance and business ethics
--+-------------------------------

 
We have a relatively small environmental footprint, so our stewardship programs focus on improving eco-awareness, identifying efficiencies and integrating more sustainable practices into our daily operations. Our priority assessment considered investor and other stakeholder interests and is aligned with the requirements of ESG ratings agencies and with leading ESG frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB.
 
We encourage you to view our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report published on our website for more detailed information regarding our ESG initiatives. Nothing in the report or on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees & Human Capital
 
As of February 16, 2022, we employed 660 people, the vast majority of whom reside in the U.S. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. Our average employee turnover rate in 2021 was 16 percent, while the turnover for life sciences/ medical device companies over this period was 19 percent according to a survey published by Radford – an Aon Hewitt Company. Given the uniqueness and complexity of our technology, it is critical to retain the knowledge and experience of outstanding long service employees. The experience and seniority of our employees is as critical to our future success as it has been to the success we have enjoyed to date.
 
Collective bargaining agreements do not cover any of our employees, and management considers relations with our employees to be good. We believe that the future will be defined by outstanding people and we are committed to recruiting, developing, motivating, and rewarding them.
 
We encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are committed to paying our employees fairly, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To ensure we are achieving our commitment, we benchmark and evaluate pay based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, an employee’s performance and internal equity. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.
 
In 2021, we engaged an independent third-party expert to perform a pay equity analysis that reviewed pay equity by gender, race and age. We plan to continue to engage a third-party expert to review pay equity every two to three years, as we determine necessary.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
 At Ionis, we encourage diversity in our workforce. Prejudicial barriers to human potential and productivity are foreign to our values. We recognize that for the full potential of our workforce to be realized, we must cultivate an inclusive culture where all employees feel empowered to contribute fully in an environment that values different perspectives, leading to better ​​​​​​​ideas and increased innovation. We have several employee-led resource groups dedicated to different aspects of diversity and a diverse management team and board of directors.
Training and Development
 
We designed our training and development programs to help employees gain important Ionis knowledge and develop the skills to be successful. All of our trainings from new hire through senior leader, are focused on the Ionis culture and core principles and learning what we mean when we say: “Working the Ionis Way.”
 
We empower our employees to build rewarding careers at Ionis, driven by a culture of yes that encourages personal and professional employee growth. Ionis offers robust training opportunities with course offerings and events available to every employee regardless of level or function.
