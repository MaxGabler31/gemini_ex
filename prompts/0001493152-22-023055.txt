ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. (“Sparta,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation with headquarters in New York City, www.spartacommercial.com. We are a multi-disciplined parent corporation operating across three business sectors – Financial Services, E-Commerce & Mobile Technology, and Health and Wellness, (www.spartacommercial.com).
 
Sparta’s roots are in the Powersports industry. The Company provided retail installment loans and leases through authorized motorcycle dealerships in 33 states, with financing provided by institutional lenders. The Company also maintained a full underwriting and servicing platform for its portfolio. Notwithstanding the discontinuance of our initial focus on consumer loans and leases post Lehman and during the 2008 financial crisis; in 2007, the Company had introduced a new initiative, Municipal Financing, (www.spartamunicipal.com), which has financed over 100 jurisdictions to date. Sparta’s Municipal Finance program is also currently available to all nonprofit organizations, institutions and entities. All nonprofit organizations which adhere to IRS guidelines, including 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible. Both public nonprofits, also known as public charities supported with publicly collected funds, and private nonprofits, also known as private foundations supported by an individual or business entity, qualify for the program.
 
Vehicle History Reports are a staple of Sparta’s E-Commerce Technology subsidiary iMobile Solutions, Inc. Whether a vehicle is intended for business or recreational use, Sparta’s Vehicle History Reports are highly regarded for accuracy and completeness and have been sold across all 50 states and in 62 countries worldwide. They provide a trusted layer of assurance to vehicle buyers and are available on Kelley Blue Book, AllState Insurance and a range of various dealership websites. They include Cyclechex (Motorcycle History Reports at www.cyclechex.com), RVchex (Recreational Vehicle History Reports at www.rvchex.com), and Truckchex (Heavy Duty Truck History Reports at www.truckchex.com). Consumers, retailers, municipals, nonprofits, auction houses, banks and insurance companies alike scrutinize title history reports for the vital information needed and factored into crucial business decisions that affect the bottom line.
 
The Company’s E-Commerce and Mobile Technology subsidiary name change to iMobile Solutions, Inc., from Specialty Reports, Inc., in 2016, signifies its ever-broadening service offerings in the evolving technology landscape. With iMobile App (www.imobileapp.com), the Company provides mobile technology services, including web and mobile application creation, development and management for a wide range of businesses to increase revenue, build brand recognition, and improve customer engagement. Our ever-broadening business base of mobile application includes vehicle dealerships and racetracks, private clubs and country clubs, schools and entertainment venues, restaurants and grocery stores, as well as various other merchant types. (www.imobileapp.com/app-gallery). The Company also designs, launches, maintains and hosts websites for businesses incorporating SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews to improve their presence online. We provide specific, tailored action plans for our clients’ websites that include services such as eCommerce, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) development and integration. This custom software not only helps businesses communicate with customers but can also be used for employees to communicate internally. The CRM software can be web based, integrated with a mobile app, or both. We work with clients to understand their unique needs and incorporate the features and requirements that are most important to them and will facilitate their business growth and success. Correspondingly, the Company designs and builds custom kitchen ordering software for independent grocery stores, delicatessens, and other food service businesses. The software can be designed for use in a combination of ways including mobile devices and in-store ordering. The kitchen ordering software is enabled with payment integration, text messaging notification, wireless printing, and other features. iMobile Solutions, Inc. provides a turn-key solution for any business looking to simplify or streamline their kitchen ordering process. Additionally, we offer text messaging services, which supplement business marketing strategies both to gain and retain brand loyalty among its clients, customers and investors. Our text messaging platform allows our clients to easily manage, schedule and analyze text message performance.
 
Sparta created its subsidiary, New World Health Brands, Inc., in April 2019, on the heels of the Agriculture Improvement Act (also known as the Farm Bill), which was signed into law the previous December 20, 2018. Consequently, hemp (CBD) was removed from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. Company management recognized the substantial business opportunity that lay ahead in the rapidly expanding hemp-CBD (cannabidiol) market in the United States. During 2019-2020, we sourced, developed and tested 5 CBD product categories totalling 31 products. We procured premium, domestic-grade, full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and THC free hemp, created product packaging and labelling, and implemented fulfilment to launch an online B to C website: www.newworldhealthcbd.com on December 21, 2019. The Company has since curated its products and currently offers 15 products with plans to add complementary products to our product line. Our CBD products are available in full spectrum, broad spectrum and non-detectable below the legal limit of .3 THC (ND-THC) and come in capsules, oils, tablets, gel caps, tinctures, salves, creams, lotions, as well as pet chews and tinctures. We remain watchful of consumer needs, adjusting our product line offerings either by adding new products, adjusting the potency levels of existing products or discontinuing still others, as warranted. To ensure the safety and quality of our products, all CBD product offerings are exclusively sourced, manufactured and tested at highly accredited testing facilities in the United States and adhere to strict U.S standards and guidelines. Because of our high standards, in-depth quality testing and label transparency, consumers know they can trust us.


Sparta’s response to the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic in early 2020 quickly took shape with thorough investigations into evolving customer trends in health and wellness. As a result, we expanded New World Health Brands and developed a new product line of natural dietary supplements. In August 2020, we launched an online B to C website: www.newworldhealthbrands.com, featuring high quality dietary supplements, including vitamins and minerals, such as, Zinc, Magnesium, Boron, Iodine, Beetroot Extract, Selenium, Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C and PQQ. To ensure the safety and quality of our products, all health and wellness offerings are exclusively sourced and manufactured in the United States and adhere to strict U.S standards and guidelines. Sparta’s commitment to high standards and transparency are tantamount to being a trusted brand.
 
Sparta’s newest subsidiary, Sparta Crypto, Inc., www.SpartaCrypto.com, was established September 25, 2020 and is in the process of completing a proprietary state-of-the-art platform designed to connect users of widely adopted digital currencies with sellers of various goods and services. The platform has not launched and the Company can make no assurances that the described plan will reach implementation. In addition, the Company has completed and tested a cryptocurrency payment gateway called SpartaPayIQ, www.SpartaPayIQ.com, which is functional and was formally announced on March 3, 2022.

MOBILE APPS
 
Sparta creates mobile applications (mobile apps) for small and medium-size businesses under the tradename iMobileApp. iMobileApp employs a subscription business model and is positioned as a fast and affordable way for businesses to develop and launch a mobile app. The iMobileApp platform allows businesses to have a high-quality, fully functioning custom mobile app often at a lower cost than traditional marketing efforts, and typically at a significantly lower cost than a commercial quality website.
 
The Company has developed and managed mobile apps since 2011, creating hundreds of mobile apps for a wide variety of businesses for customers in 49 states and Canada. Today, iMobileApp is the largest provider of mobile app technology to the Harley-Davidson dealership network in the United States.
 
Mobile apps are one of the most important digital tools that a consumer-facing business can employ. Smartphones and tablets are now the leading devices for accessing the internet, and it is estimated that upwards of 80% of mobile use time is dedicated to utilizing mobile apps. As consumers become more mobile, businesses are increasingly seeing the need to as well. Currently, the mobile app development industry serving small to medium-sized businesses is fragmented, and the Company believes that iMobileApp can become a brand leader in this category.
 
An iMobileApp provides consumers easy access to a business website simply by touching the Company’s application icon. There is no need to search for or type in a web address. iMobileApp has dozens of basic and advanced functions, including providing businesses the ability to send a segmented promotional message that appears on the consumer’s mobile device front page, rather than in an email or text message. “Geo-fencing” is a feature that allows businesses to message customers who are in the vicinity of their store or event, or even when visiting a competitor.
 
The iMobileApp pricing model includes a modest up-front development fee, and an auto-renewing monthly subscription. Once a business launches an iMobileApp, the Company provides them with marketing tools to assist their customers in downloading the mobile app from the Apple and Android app stores. The Company offers two levels of on-going maintenance and support. The basic subscription provides training, technical support and software updates. The premium-priced program adds a fully managed feature, allowing businesses to contact iMobileApp Customer Service who will initiate campaigns, promotional messaging, and other iMobileApp features on behalf of the client.
 
A partial listing of iMobileApp features includes:
 
Mobile Client Framework (“MCF”) - Our mobile framework software allows us to provide customized apps that can be installed on the individual mobile devices and deployed through the Apple and Android app stores.
 
Content Management System (CMS) -iMobileApp customers can use our web-based content management system to upload images to their mobile app, change text content, change colors, organize the order of tabs, and publish updates to the app.
 
Customized Registration System - iMobileApp customers can elect to present their users with a registration screen on startup that collects information such as first name, last name, email address and telephone number in order to track marketing information and push individual notification messages for future functionality.
 
Push Notification System – A direct communication channel between businesses and their mobile app users. Allows brands to socialize directly with their very best customers, anytime, anywhere, to build a relationship at a one-to-one level.
 
Geo-Fencing Feature – Allows businesses to create an invisible “message fence” around a specific geographic area. When their app users are within the fenced area, the user receives a pre-programmed message on their device. This is especially useful when businesses have special promotions or events they would like to advertise to nearby users who are most likely to take advantage of them. Businesses can also “geo-fence” around a competitor, offering their users special promotions before they enter the competitor’s venue.
 
Inventory Display Manager – Business can manage, display and sell from their inventory on their mobile app. Inventory can be integrated through web link, hand-key, or inventory management data feed.

Event Manager – Business can manage and display upcoming events on their mobile app. Customers can view the event calendar, RSVP and Inventory can be integrated through web link, hand-key, or inventory management data feed.
 
Quick Dial Feature – Users tap the Quick Dial option to get a list of the business phone numbers on their mobile phones. The user selects the number to dial by putting their finger on the number. The business can add, remove, and edit phone numbers that appear in the Quick Dial screen from their CMS.
 
Multi-Location Management – Business can add and manage multiple locations on their app, each with distinct hours of operations, user database and notification segmentation. Businesses pay subscription fees for each location they wish to include in their app. Customers can use the client customization portal to add locations to their mobile app.
 
Marketing and Branding of iMobileApp
 
Marketing Materials - We provide customized marketing materials that app customers can download and display digitally or physically.
 
Embedded Product Developer and SRI Branding - The “about” screen of the application contains information useful to the support of the product. It also contains a powered-by-the-product-developer logo and text. iMS can choose to use a different logo, but the powered-by-the-product-developer text remains on the “about” screen.
 
App store and Google Android Distribution - All native applications are deployed through the product developer’s App store and Android Market Place online accounts.
 
Marketing information - If an app customer has enabled first-time user data collection then that information will be available to the app customer on their portal.
 
WEBSITES
 
The Company designs, launches, maintains and hosts websites for businesses incorporating SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews to improve their presence online.

VEHICLE HISTORY REPORTS
 
The vehicle history report group is currently marketing through its websites: Cyclechex Motorcycle History Reports© (www.cyclechex.com), RVchex™ RV History Reports (www.rvchex.com), and Truckchex Heavy Duty Truck History Reports (www.truckchex.com). These reports contain valuable information for consumers, dealers, insurers, auction houses, and lenders. The information includes a vehicle’s history, such as disclosed damage, salvaged or rebuilt title brands, the number of previous owners, the last recorded odometer reading, the manufacturer’s original equipment, and OEM recall data. We assemble the data for these reports from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, governmental agencies, in order to provide the most current information available for the benefit of all interested parties. We believe our products offer a compelling value because they are priced modestly and we provide a no-hassle, 90-day and 100% money-back guarantee. We are confident that our Specialty Reports provide buyers and sellers the peace of mind that comes from being able to make an informed decision.
 
In June 2010, iMobile Solutions, Inc. entered into an exclusive five-year agreement with a U.S. government authorized third-party distributor of on-line data from National Motor Vehicle Title System (NMVTIS) for NMVTIS data on motorcycles, scooters, ATVs and recreational vehicles. This agreement has been renewed on a year to year basis.

NMVTIS is an information system that federal law required the United States Department of Justice to establish and to provide an electronic means to verify vehicle title, brand, and theft data among motor vehicle administrators, law enforcement officials, prospective purchasers and insurance carriers. NMVTIS was initially authorized in the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 and reauthorized by the Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act of 1996. After passage of the 1996 reauthorization, responsibility was transferred from the U.S. Department of Transportation to the U.S. Department of Justice. The NMVTIS system is a Department of Justice program currently operated by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). The system also provides a means for states to share title information in order to prevent fraud and other crime.
 
NMVTIS was created to:
 

● | Prevent the introduction or reintroduction of stolen motor vehicles into interstate commerce 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Protect states, consumers (both individual and commercial), and other entities from fraud 
● | Reduce the use of stolen vehicles for illicit purposes including funding of criminal enterprises 
● | Provide consumer protection from unsafe vehicles 

 
NMVTIS information is supplied by state motor vehicle agency records and entire sectors (e.g., insurance, auto recyclers/junk/salvage, etc.) addressed by the Anti-Car Theft Act. As opposed to purchasing information from specific businesses or companies, entities are required to provide specific information to NMVTIS in a specific format. NMVTIS is intended to serve as a reliable source of title and brand history for automobiles, motorcycles and other vehicles. However, there are certain pieces of vehicle history data that NMVTIS’ database does not contain; for example, a vehicle’s repair history. Currently the data provided to NMVTIS by states is provided in a variety of time frames; while some report and update NVMTIS data in real-time (as title transactions occur) others send updates less frequently, such as once every 24 hours or within a period of days.
 
Vehicle History Reports benefit consumers:
 

● | Consumers can purchase reports directly from the Cyclechex, RVchex, or Truckchex website 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consumers can purchase reports via an Affiliate website 

 
Vehicle History Reports benefit dealers:
 

● | Dealers can purchase a block of history reports from Cyclechex, RVchex, or Truckchex (with pricing incentives to purchase a larger quantity of reports) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reports facilitate acceptance of trade-in vehicles and add value to the purchase of any pre-owned motorcycle, RV, automobile, light truck or heavy-duty truck 
● | Dealers can provide reports to customers 

Vehicle History Reports Affiliate Program:
 

● | Dealers and other industry sources can incorporate the Cyclechex, RVchex, or Truckchex website linking their sales and marketing strategies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Affiliates earn commission on Cyclechex, RVchex, or Truckchex history reports generated from their sites

NEW WORLD HEALTH BRANDS CBD
 
During 2019-2020, management sourced, developed and tested 5 CBD product categories totaling 31 products, procured product packaging, created clear-transparency labeling, implemented fulfillment and launched an on-line B2C website, www.newworldhealthcbd.com. The Company has since curated its products and currently offers 15 products with plans to add complementary products to our product line.
Sourcing CBD Products
 
All of our CBD products are sourced through third party suppliers in Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming. NWHB carries single compound isolates, as well as products made from high quality, whole-plant, industrial hemp extracts, containing a full-spectrum of phytocannabinoids, including CBD, terpenes, flavonoids, and other minor, but valuable hemp compounds. Hemp extracts from Industrial Hemp are generally cannabis with less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Cannabis, which contains THC, causes psychoactive effects when consumed. NWHB does not produce or sell any products derived from high-THC cannabis/marijuana plants. Our products come from domestic seed, have clean label transparency and are third party tested for CBD potency, heavy metals, pesticides, microbials, and more, by ISO/IEC 17025 accredited labs.
 
NWHB manages risks that are associated with third-party suppliers and manufacturers by identifying and qualifying alternative providers. NWHB regularly assess its supply chain for any threats to business continuity. None of the third party suppliers are considered to be material to the business on a standalone basis and as any given supplier is lost in a specific region, NWHB has replaced supplier without material disruption as it can contract with multiple alternative suppliers and manufacturers.
 
CBD Product Categories
 
Our product line consists of only industrial hemp-based CBD containing zero or less than 0.03% THC. We do not manufacture or market edibles. We do not manufacture or market CBD vapes. Our present product base consists of products in 5 categories: tinctures, capsules & tablets, topicals, Zero THC and tinctures and chews for pets. The per serving dosage of CBD products ranges from 3.3mg to 50mg, depending on the dose. Our product line includes: tinctures of various sizes and flavors: capsules of differing potency and quantity; tablets of differing potency and quantity; salve of differing potency and quantity; creams and lotions of differing potency and quantity; and pet chews and tinctures.
NEW WORLD HEALTH BRANDS - WELLNESS
 
Our Wellness products feature high quality dietary supplements, including vitamins and minerals, such as, Zinc, Magnesium, Boron, Iodine, Selenium, Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C and PQQ. In addition to our B to C website: www.newworldhealthbrands.com, our Wellness products are also offered on on-line marketplaces such as Amazon. We continue to study the market as we consider new products to add to our offerings.

Strategic Advantage
 
NWHB benefits from the parent Company’s vertical integration of supply and service chains providing support of its on demand web/mobile application development/maintenance, accounting, corporate governance, and real time customer support across the NWHB product line. This relationship results in significant time and cost efficiencies and fosters a mutually beneficial parent/subsidiary relationship.
 
As the NWHB subsidiary grows, the Company will help NWHB develop its own managerial control group at such time as the subsidiary can afford an incremental building of a dedicated management team.
 
MARKETING AND SALES
 
Our marketing starts with product development. We create compelling products that: (i) in the case of iMobile Solutions, Inc. and iMobileApp, provide a variety of small to mid-sized businesses with a state-of-the-art website and mobile application solutions, and (ii) in the case of our four vehicle history report products, provide historical title information that assists consumers in purchase decision-making and dealers, auction houses, or other entities in making a sale or evaluating a vehicle.
 
iMobile Solutions, Inc. (iMS)
 
The primary marketing objective for iMS is to continue penetrating new business verticals and to be the leader is mobile app development for growing businesses. While an iMobileApp can benefit any business, the Company identifies and focuses marketing efforts on specific verticals, currently comprised of vehicle dealers, country clubs, racetracks, restaurants, etc., to build a presence in certain industries and become the “go-to” mobile app developer for those markets. As we continue to target franchised vehicle dealers by type of product and manufacturer by specifically approaching each dealership in their dealer network to promote our iMS mobile application we are gaining market share of the vehicle dealer marketplace. By selling our mobile applications throughout one manufacturer’s dealer network, we benefit from “word of mouth” referrals while building a recognizable presence in that particular market. For example, a leading motorcycle manufacturer has over 1,400 authorized dealers worldwide. By penetrating this market, we significantly improve our credibility with their entire dealer network, resulting in the individual dealers being more receptive to our sales call, and making them more likely to purchase an iMobileApp and refer us to other dealers.
 
Additional marketing has been done through targeted advertising as well as news stories in relevant trade publications.
 
iMobileApp (iMA)
 
There are two primary areas of focus to continue gaining market share for iMA – digital marketing and targeted sales efforts.
 
The digital marketing strategy is predicated on the fact that the business mobile app marketplace is emerging and highly fragmented. In parallel, the web is not yet dominated by any one business mobile app competitor. Our strategy is to build a strong digital web presence that will help grow our business in the short term, and establish iMA as the market leader in web search as the industry consolidates. The cornerstone of our digital strategy is a state-of-the-art web management platform (see www.iMobileApp.com) that is highly search engine optimized (SEO) in structure and content. Page rank and traffic will increase over time as we support the website with traffic building efforts through blogging, social networking, ad-clicks, remarketing, and continual technical and content optimization. The goal is to have a leadership market share in organic and accidental search for businesses seeking mobile application solutions.
 
Traditional sales and marketing efforts will be employed against key categories that have an established high level of acceptance for mobile apps and/or in which iMA has already established market share. Efforts will include inside sales calls, email campaigns, category trade association marketing, and customer referrals.

Vehicle History Reports
 
The vehicle categories that we are targeting - motorcycles, recreational vehicles and commercial trucks – are not the focus of our largest competitors (CARFAX®, AutoCheck®). Distribution in the vehicle history reports industry is web-based, and digital competition in our targeted categories is relatively weak and fragmented. Our digital strategy is to become the leading search result for consumers seeking information on used powersports vehicles RV’s, and heavy-duty trucks. We employ an advanced web management platform that is highly search engine optimized (SEO). Page rank and traffic will increase over time as we support the website with traffic building efforts through blogging, social networking, ad-clicks, remarketing, and continual technical and content optimization.
 
An equally important digital strategy is our affiliate and cross-marketing programs. By working with leading companies that serve this category – like AutoTrader®, National Powersports Distributors, Kelley Blue Book®, and AllState® Insurance – we are able to cross-promote our powersports and RV history reporting products on their websites. Consumers who are on affiliate or marketing partner sites can become aware of our reporting services and click through to our websites. If a purchase is completed, the referring affiliate receives a commission on the sale or in some cases may extend a discount to their customers.
 
In December 2010, Powersports Business chose Cyclechex as one of their “Nifty 50” winners, recognizing it as one of the top 50 new powersports products introduced during the year.
 
SRI has considerable opportunity to increase brand awareness and grow traffic through product development, targeted marketing programs and strategic partnerships.
 
Municipal and Non-Profit Leasing
 
In 2011, the Company launched a website (www.spartamunicipal.com) exclusively dedicated to the Company’s municipal business line that began in 2007. With this site, agency heads, police and fire department chiefs, dealerships, and other municipal financing decision makers as well as non-profits have direct online access to information about the Municipal Lease Program, including how it benefits governmental agency economic interests, and specifics about terms and options. Marketing efforts, when budgets allow, include attending tradeshows, advertising in industry publication, direct mail/email campaigns, and indirect marketing such as referrals by prior municipal customers or dealerships. Sparta’s municipal program is also included in the corporate sites of Harley-Davidson© and BMW Motorrad USA Police Motors for government fleet leasing which results in direct inquiries from municipalities.
 
New World Health Brands CBD
 
Our initial marketing strategy has been a direct-to-consumer online sales approach via our website www.newworldhealthcbd.com within the United States, by using e-commerce to reach consumers to introduce and guide them through the CBD buying process. Starting with a solid foundation of content and robust product offerings, our marketing strategy will continue to be supplemented with social media exposure, (Facebook and Instagram) and ultimately retail distribution as the strategy evolves. At present, NWHB has developed preliminary distribution within the New York City metro area within independent pharmacies, medical supply stores, smoke shops, spas, and independent retail food stores. Using data collection and customer analysis from e-commerce sales will continue to be a significant component of NWHB’s marketing strategy. Direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales give an unprecedented opportunity to gain significant insight into how to better support the customer based on data, including buying habits, purchase frequency, and in many cases, how the product is being used, whether it be general wellness, health conditions, etc. By building customer trust with a focus on premium, quality products and live customer service, we expect to build a well-recognized brand. Through our own social media and blogging platforms, management expects New World Health Brands will continue to grow CBD organic sales and revenue by promoting our products as trusted brands for consumers who desire premium CBD products.
Sales and Customer Support
 
An internal team is responsible for closing sales on leads generated from web inquires, email responses, inside sales calls and customer referrals. A future sales team will target businesses, trade associations, national chains, manufacturers, vehicle dealers and vehicle auction houses.
 
Customer service is based in our New York City office.

Competition
 
While there are numerous entities offering customized mobile apps, we believe that iMobileApp is a leading pre-packaged customizable mobile app for small to medium sized business, such as restaurants, country clubs, social clubs, racetracks, grocery stores, agriculture dealers, vehicle dealers, and more, at a price point significantly below other vendors of customized apps for the vehicle dealer industry.
 
Because of our strong commitment to customer service and our compelling product, we believe that our iMobileApp product can be effectively and competitively marketed.
 
The two major providers of used automobile history reports, CARFAX® and AutoCheck® do not provide motorcycle, recreational vehicle or heavy duty truck history reports. In fact, CARFAX® states on their website FAQ’s that their database contains records primarily of cars and light trucks and “for heavy trucks, RVs, or motorcycles, CARFAX® recommends checking with your DMV, enthusiast forums, and of course a pre-purchase vehicle inspection.” AutoCheck® states on its web site “AutoCheck® only reports on information for cars and light trucks.” We have not identified direct competition of the RV space and do not intend to compete directly with either CarFax® or AutoCheck®.
 
Competition within the CBD-based hemp products industry is very fragmented and highly competitive. The competition is comprised of publically and privately-owned companies and tend to be diverse in terms of geographic market coverage and variety of product mix offered. The “CBD industry” includes tinctures, capsules and tablets, topicals, patches, edibles, vapes, smokables and drinkables all based on pure CBD, defined as containing less than 0.3% THC; blended CBD and THC. NWHB is focused on marketing only hemp-based CBD products. To our knowledge there are only four public companies selling only CBD products. Because of this fragmented market where there is not one sole widely recognized brand, we believe that by focusing on high quality, gluten free, non-GMO, pure CBD products using targeted brand marketing programs we can make New World Health Brands initially a regionally recognized brand and then, potentially, a nationally recognized brand.
