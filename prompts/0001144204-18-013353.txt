Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General 
 We are a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers that was established in 1995 through the merger of long-standing specialty contractors. Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets. Our operations are currently conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries, including: The L. E. Myers Co.; Harlan Electric Company; Great Southwestern Construction, Inc.; Sturgeon Electric Company, Inc.; MYR Transmission Services, Inc.; E.S. Boulos Company; Western Pacific Enterprises Ltd.; High Country Line Construction, Inc.; MYR Transmission Services Canada, Ltd.; Northern Transmission Services, Ltd.; Sturgeon Electric California, LLC; and GSW Integrated Services, LLC. We provide electrical construction services, and limited gas construction services, through a network of local offices located throughout the United States and western Canada. We provide a broad range of services, including design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services, with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 1701 Golf Road, Suite 3-1012, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008. The telephone number of our principal executive offices is (847) 290-1891. 
 Reportable Segments 
 Through our subsidiaries, we are a leading specialty contractor serving the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets in the United States and western Canada. We manage and report our operations through two electrical contracting service segments: Transmission and Distribution (T&D) and Commercial and Industrial (C&I). We generally focus on improving our profitability by selecting projects we believe will provide attractive margins, actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects, holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications, and rewarding our employees for effectively managing costs. 
 Transmission and Distribution segment  We have operated in the T&D industry since 1891. We are one of the largest U.S. contractors servicing the T&D sector of the electric utility and renewable energy industries. We provide a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities, which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services, with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair, to customers in the electric utility and the renewable energy industries throughout the United States and Canada. Our T&D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems. We also provide emergency restoration services in response to hurricane, ice or other storm-related damage. 
 In our T&D segment, we generally serve the electric utility industry as a prime contractor, through traditional design-bid-build or engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) forms of project delivery. We have long-standing relationships with many of our T&D customers who rely on us to construct and maintain reliable electric and other utility infrastructure. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year master service agreements (MSAs) and other variable-term service agreements. 
 Commercial and Industrial segment  We have provided electrical contracting services for C&I construction since 1912. Our C&I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of traffic networks and the installation of bridge, roadway and tunnel lighting. Our C&I operations are primarily in the western and northeastern United States and in western Canada where we have sufficient scale to deploy the level of resources necessary to achieve significant market share. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise are critical to successful and timely execution. Typical C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, convention centers, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities and transportation control and management systems.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In our C&I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors, but also contract directly with facility owners. We have a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships. 
 Additional financial information related to our business segments is provided under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 15  Segment Information to our Financial Statements. 
 Customers 
 Our T&D customers include many of the leading companies in the electric utility industry. Our T&D customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. Our C&I customer base includes general contractors, commercial and industrial facility owners, local governments and developers. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and we cultivate these relationships at all levels of our organization from senior management to project supervisors. We seek to build upon our customer relationships to secure additional projects from our current customer base. Many of our customer relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through a partnering approach, which includes project evaluation and consulting, quality performance, performance measurement and direct customer contact. At all levels of management, we maintain a focus on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. In addition, our management teams promote and market our services for prospective large-scale projects and national accounts. We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise, customer relationships and emphasis on safety and customer service contribute to obtaining new contracts with both existing and new customers. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our top 10 customers accounted for 40.4%, 46.4%, and 44.6% of our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one T&D customer accounted for 10.7% of our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of annual revenues. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenues derived from T&D customers accounted for 62.7%, 71.7% and 74.9% of our total revenues, respectively, and revenues derived from C&I customers accounted for 37.3%, 28.3% and 25.1% of our total revenues, respectively. 
 Types of Service Arrangements and Bidding Process 
 We enter into contracts principally through a competitive bid process. Our typical construction project begins with the preparation and submission of a bid to a customer. If selected as the successful bidder, we generally enter into a contract with the customer that provides for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts we undertake, our contracts are primarily structured as fixed-price agreements, under which we agree to do the entire project for a fixed amount, or unit-price agreements, under which we agree to do the work at a fixed price per unit of work as specified in the agreement. We also enter into time-and-equipment contracts under which we are paid for labor and equipment at negotiated hourly billing rates and for other expenses, including materials, as incurred, and time-and-materials contracts under which we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for other expenses, including materials, as incurred. Finally, we sometimes enter into cost-plus contracts, where we are paid for our costs plus a negotiated margin. On occasion, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts require us to include a guaranteed not-to-exceed maximum price. 
 Fixed-price and unit-price contracts typically have the highest potential margins; however, they hold a greater risk in terms of profitability because cost overruns may not be recoverable. Time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts have less margin upside, but generally have a lower risk of cost overruns. Work in our T&D segment is generally completed under fixed-price, time-and-materials, time-and-equipment, unit-price and cost-plus agreements. C&I work is typically performed under fixed-price, time-and-materials, cost-plus, and unit-price agreements. Fixed-price contracts accounted for 43.5%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, including 31.4%, of our total revenue for our T&D segment and 63.7%, of our total revenue for our C&I segment.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Our EPC contracts are typically fixed-price. We may act as the prime contractor for an EPC project where we perform the procurement and construction functions but use a subcontractor to perform the engineering component, or we may use a subcontractor for both engineering and procurement functions. We may also act as a subcontractor on an EPC project to an engineering or construction management firm. When acting as a subcontractor for an EPC project, we typically provide construction services only, although we may also perform both the construction and procurement functions. 
 Our T&D segment also provides services under MSAs that cover maintenance, upgrade and extension services, as well as new construction. Work performed under MSAs is typically billed on a unit-price, time-and-materials or time-and-equipment basis. MSAs are typically one to three years in duration; however, most of our contracts, including MSAs, may be terminated by our customers on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract. Under MSAs, customers generally agree to use us for certain services in a specified geographic region. Most MSA customers have no obligation to assign specific volumes of work to us and are not required to use us exclusively, although in some cases they are subject to our right of first refusal. Many of our contracts, including MSAs, are open to public bid at expiration and generally attract numerous bidders. 
 A portion of the work we perform requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds or letters of credit at the time of execution of the contract. Most of our contracts include retention provisions of up to 10%, which are generally withheld from each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved. 
 Materials 
 In many cases, our T&D customers are responsible for supplying their own materials on projects; however, under certain contracts, we may agree to provide all or a portion of the required materials. For our C&I contracts, we usually procure the necessary materials and supplies. We are not dependent on any one supplier for materials or supplies. 
Subcontracting 
 We are the prime contractor for the majority of our T&D projects. We may use subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts and to manage workflow, particularly for design, engineering, procurement and some foundation work. We often work with subcontractors who are sole proprietorships or small business entities. Subcontractors normally provide their own employees, vehicles, tools and insurance coverages. We are not dependent on any single subcontractor. Our contracts with subcontractors often contain provisions limiting our obligation to pay the subcontractor if our client has not paid us. We hold our subcontractors responsible for their work or delays in their performance. On larger projects we may require performance and payment bonding from subcontractors, where we deem appropriate, based on the risk involved. We occasionally perform work as a subcontractor, and we may elect to do so from time-to-time on larger projects in order to manage our execution risk. When we perform work as a subcontractor we are often only paid after the general or prime contractor is paid. 
 The majority of the work in our C&I segment is done as a subcontractor to a general contractor. 
 Competition 
 Our business is highly competitive in both our T&D and C&I segments. Competition in both of our business segments is primarily based on the price of the construction services and upon the reputation for safety, quality and reliability of the contractor. The competition we encounter can vary depending upon the type and/or location of construction services. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors that customers consider in our industry are:
 
 | price and flexible contract terms;
--+-----------------------------------


 | safety programs and safety performance;
--+----------------------------------------


 | technical expertise and experience;
--+------------------------------------


 | management team experience;
--+----------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate financial resources and bonding capacity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | technological capabilities; and
--+--------------------------------


 | weather-damage restoration abilities and reputation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, most of their work is awarded through a bid process where price is always a principal factor. See Risk Factors  Our industry is highly competitive. Increased competition can place downward pressure on contract prices and profit margins and may limit the number of projects that we are awarded. 
 T&D Competition 
 Our T&D segment competes with a number of companies in the local markets where we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms. There are many national or large regional firms that compete with us for T&D contracts including, among others, Asplundh Construction Corp., Davis H. Elliot Company, Inc., Henkels & McCoy, Inc., MasTec, Inc., MDU Resources Group, Inc., Michels Corporation, Pike Corporation, Power Line Services, Inc., Quanta Services, Inc. and Willbros Group, Inc. 
 There are a number of barriers to entry into the transmission services business, including the cost of equipment and tooling necessary to perform transmission work, the availability of qualified labor, the scope of typical transmission projects and the technical, managerial and supervisory skills necessary to complete the job. Larger transmission projects generally require specialized heavy duty equipment as well as strong financial resources to meet the cash flow, bonding, or letter of credit requirements of these projects. These factors sometimes reduce the number of potential competitors on these projects. The number of firms that generally compete for any one significant transmission infrastructure project varies greatly depending on a number of factors, including the size of the project, its location and the bidder qualification requirements imposed upon contractors by the customer. Some of our competitors restrict their operations to one geographic area, and others operate nationally and internationally. 
 Compared to the transmission markets, there are fewer significant barriers to entry into the distribution markets in which we operate. As a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise can compete for distribution projects. Instead of outsourcing to us, some of our T&D customers also employ personnel internally to perform the same type of services that we provide. 
 C&I Competition 
 Our C&I segment competes with a number of regional or small local firms and subsidiaries of larger national firms. Competition for our C&I construction services varies greatly. There are few significant barriers to entry in the C&I business, and there are a number of small companies that compete for C&I business. The size, location and technical requirements of the project will impact which competitors and the number of competitors that we will encounter when bidding on any particular project. 
 A major competitive factor in our C&I segment is the individual relationships that we and our competitors have developed with general contractors who typically manage the bid process. Additionally, the equipment requirements for C&I work are generally not as significant as that of T&D construction. Since C&I construction typically involves the purchase of materials, the financial resources to meet the materials procurement and equipment requirements of a particular project may impact the competition that we encounter. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by bidding for larger and/or more technically complex projects, which we believe many of our smaller competitors may not be capable of executing

 effectively or profitably. We believe that we have a favorable competitive position in the markets that we serve due in part to our strong operating history and strong local market share as well as our reputation and relationships with our customers. 
Project Bonding Requirements and Parent Guarantees 
 Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We generally must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. These bonds are typically issued at the face value of the contract awarded. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $200.8 million in original face amount of bonds outstanding for projects in our T&D segment and $296.2 million for projects in our C&I segment. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects for both segments was approximately $144.5 million as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $654.2 million in original face amount of bonds outstanding for projects in our T&D segment and $233.5 million for projects in our C&I segment. The ability to post bonds provides us with a competitive advantage over smaller or less financially secure competitors. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as our strong and long-standing relationship with our surety, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and bonds. 
 From time to time we guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Additionally, from time to time we are required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under our credit facility. 
 Backlog 
 We refer to our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts, as backlog. We calculate backlog differently for different types of contracts. For our fixed-price contracts, we include the full remaining portion of the contract in our calculation of backlog. A customers intention to award us work under a fixed-price contract is not included in backlog unless there is an actual award and contract to perform a specific scope of work at specific terms and pricing. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of MSAs that typically have a one-year to three-year duration from execution. Given the duration of our contracts and MSAs and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue we expect to realize during any period and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to generate in the following fiscal year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Our estimated backlog also includes our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits and may not accurately represent future revenue. 
 Certain projects that we undertake are not completed in one accounting period. Revenue on construction contracts is recorded based upon the percentage-of-completion accounting method, under which revenue is determined by the ratio of costs incurred to date on the contracts to managements estimates of total contract costs. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, revenue recognition is largely a function of contract costs incurred for any given period. Contract costs may include direct material, labor, subcontractor and material procurement services, equipment, and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs. While our contracts typically include labor, equipment and indirect costs, the amount of subcontractor and material costs on any individual contract can vary considerably.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 There can be no assurance as to the accuracy of our customers requirements or of our estimates of existing and future needs under MSAs, or of the values of our cost or time-dependent contracts and, therefore, our current backlog may not be realized as part of our future revenues. Subject to the foregoing discussions, the following table summarizes our backlog that we believe to be firm as of the dates shown and the backlog that we reasonably estimate will not be recognized within the next twelve months: 

 | Backlog at December 31, 2017 | | 
(in thousands) | Total | | Amount estimated to not be recognized within 12 months | Total Backlog at December 31, 2016
T&D | $ | 333,147 | | $ | 30,823 | $ | 386,701
C&I | | 345,992 | | | 39,316 | | 302,131
Total | $ | 679,139 | | $ | 70,139 | $ | 688,832

 Changes in backlog from period to period are primarily the result of fluctuations in the timing of awards and revenue recognition of contracts. Our backlog as of December 31, 2017 included our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture backlog totaling $27.6 million. The December 31, 2017 backlog does not include any amount related to the previously announced Denver Central 70 Project. We expect this project to be added to backlog in the first quarter of 2018. 
 Trade Names and Intellectual Property 
 We operate in the United States under a number of trade names, including The L. E. Myers Co.; Harlan Electric Company; Great Southwestern Construction, Inc.; Sturgeon Electric Company, Inc.; MYR Transmission Services, Inc.; E.S. Boulos Company; High Country Line Construction, Inc.; Sturgeon Electric California, LLC; and GSW Integrated Services, LLC. We operate in Canada under the trade names MYR Transmission Services Canada, Ltd.; Northern Transmission Services, Ltd and Western Pacific Enterprises Ltd. We do not generally register our trade names, but instead rely on statutory and common law protection. While we consider our trade names to be valuable assets, we do not consider any single trade name to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption to our business. We also do not materially rely upon any patents, licenses or other intellectual property. 
Equipment 
 Our long history in the T&D industry has allowed us to be instrumental in designing much of the specialty tools and equipment used in the industry, including wire pullers, wire tensioners and aerial devices. We operate a fleet of trucks and trailers, support vehicles, bulldozers, bucket trucks, digger derricks and cranes and specialty construction equipment, such as wire pullers and wire tensioning machines. We also rely on specialized tooling, including stringing blocks, wire grips and presses. The standardization of our trucks and trailers allows us to streamline training, maintenance and parts costs. We operate a centralized fleet facility, as well as 21 regional maintenance shops throughout the United States, which are staffed by over 140 mechanics and equipment managers who service our fleet. Our ability to internally service our fleet in various markets often allows us to reduce repair costs and the time equipment is out of service by eliminating both the need to ship equipment long distances for repair and dependence on third party maintenance providers. Our maintenance shops are also able to modify standard construction equipment to meet the specific needs of our specialty applications. We are a final-stage manufacturer for several configurations of our specialty vehicles, and, in the event that a particular piece of equipment is not available to us, we can often build the component on-site, which reduces our reliance on our equipment suppliers. 
 Our fleet of equipment is managed by our centralized fleet management group. Our fleet is highly mobile, which gives us the ability to shift resources from region-to-region quickly and to effectively respond to customer needs or major weather events. Our centralized fleet management group is designed to enable us to optimize and maintain our equipment to achieve the highest equipment utilization, which helps to maintain a competitive position with respect to our equipment costs. We develop internal equipment rates which provide our business units with appropriate pricing levels to estimate their bids for new projects more accurately. We also involve our business units in prioritizing the use of our fleet assets. The fleet management group also

 manages the procurement and disposition of equipment and short-term rentals. All of these factors are critical in allowing us to operate efficiently and meet our customers needs. 
Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including:
 
 | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to electricians and engineers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | building and electrical codes;
--+-------------------------------


 | special bidding and procurement requirements on government projects; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | local laws and government acts regulating work on protected sites.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and have all material licenses required to conduct our operations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in project delays, cost overruns, remediation costs, substantial fines and/or revocation of our operating licenses. 
 Environmental Matters 
 As a result of our current and past operations, we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the use, transport and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were discharged by current or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or otherwise use our properties in certain ways such as collateral for possible financing. We could also be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations and that any obligations related to environmental matters should not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Additionally, there are significant environmental regulations under consideration to encourage the use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of greenhouse gases to address climate change. We regularly monitor the various proposals in this regard. Although the impact of climate change regulations on our business will depend on the specifics of governmental policies, legislation, and regulation, we believe that we will be well-positioned to adapt our business to meet new regulations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We are subject to risks associated with climate change and Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our failure to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations could result in significant liabilities. 
 Cyclical Nature of Business and Seasonality 
 The demand for construction and maintenance services from our customers is cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the industries we serve as well as the economy in general. As a result, our volume of business could be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions. 
 Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers industries, our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, daylight hours, availability of system outages from utilities and holidays. For example, during the winter months, demand for our T&D work may be high, but our work can be delayed due to inclement weather. During the summer months, the demand for our T&D work may be affected by fewer

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 available system outages during which we can perform electrical line service work due to peak electrical demands caused by warmer weather. During the spring and fall months, the demand for our T&D work may increase due to improved weather and system availability; however, extended periods of rain and other severe weather can affect the deployment of our crews and the efficiency of our operations. 
Employees 
 We seek to attract and retain highly qualified craft employees by providing a superior work environment through our emphasis on safety, our competitive compensation, and our high quality fleet of equipment. The number of individuals we employ varies significantly throughout the year, typically with lower staffing levels at year end and through the winter months when fewer projects are active. The number of craft employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects at any particular time. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,275 employees, consisting of approximately 950 salaried employees, including executive officers, district managers, project managers, superintendents, estimators, office managers, and staff and clerical personnel, and approximately 4,325 craft employees. Approximately 91% of our craft employees are members of unions, with the majority being members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), who are represented by many local unions under agreements with generally uniform terms and varying expiration dates. We generally are not direct parties to such local agreements, but instead these agreements are entered into by and between the IBEW local unions and the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), of which we are a member. NECA negotiates the terms of these agreements on our behalf. On occasion we will also employ individuals who are members of other trade unions pursuant to multi-employer, multi-union project agreements.
