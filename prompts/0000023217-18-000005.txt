ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Development of Business
Conagra Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "us"), is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, Hunt's®, Healthy Choice®, Slim Jim®, and Orville Redenbacher's®, as well as emerging brands, including Alexia®, Angie's® BOOMCHICKAPOP®, Blake's®, Duke's®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion.
We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1976. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. We achieved this through various acquisitions, including consumer food brands such as Banquet®, Chef Boyardee®, Marie Callender’s®, Alexia®, Blake's®, Frontera®, Duke’s®, BIGS®, and divestitures. We have divested our Lamb Weston business, Private Brands business, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business, JM Swank business, milling business, dehydrated and fresh vegetable operations, and a trading and merchandising business, among others. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital.
On November 9, 2016, we completed the spinoff of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston") through a distribution of 100% of our interest in Lamb Weston to holders, as of November 1, 2016, of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Spinoff"). The transaction effecting this change was structured as a tax-free spinoff. 
In January 2013, we acquired Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. ("Ralcorp"), a manufacturer of private branded food. Since the acquisition of Ralcorp, we focused on addressing executional shortfalls and customer service issues intended to improve operating performance for our Private Brands business. However, after further review of the Private Brands business, we changed our strategic direction and divested the Private Brands business in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.

Acquisitions
On June 26, 2018, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Pinnacle Foods Inc. ("Pinnacle") under which we plan to acquire all outstanding shares of Pinnacle common stock in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion, including Pinnacle's outstanding net debt. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive $43.11 per share in cash and 0.6494 shares of our common stock for each share of Pinnacle common stock held. The implied price of $68.00 per Pinnacle share is based on the volume-weighted average price of our stock for the five days ended June 21, 2018. The planned acquisition is expected to close by the end of calendar 2018 and remains subject to the approval of Pinnacle shareholders, the receipt of regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.

Divestitures
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada and completed the sale in July 2018, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018. The assets of this business have been reclassified as assets held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we signed an agreement to sell our Wesson® oil business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the agreement was terminated. This outcome followed the decision of the Federal Trade Commission, announced on March 5, 2018, to challenge the pending sale. The Company is still actively marketing the Wesson® oil business and expects to sell it within the next twelve months. The assets of this business have been reclassified as assets held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented.
On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business. As of such date, we did not beneficially own any equity interest in Lamb Weston and no longer consolidated Lamb Weston into our financial results. We reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec") and our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank are included in the Commercial segment.
On February 1, 2016, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, we completed the disposition of our Private Brands operations to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("Treehouse"). We reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
General
The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments.
Conagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.
We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.
Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.
We manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant.
Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the United States and most other markets where the related food items are sold. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality, sanitation, safety and health matters, and environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects 
3

and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.
Our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 24% of consolidated net sales for both fiscal 2018 and 2017 and 23% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016.
At May 27, 2018, Conagra Brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 12,400 employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 43% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, approximately 47% are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2019. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.
Research and Development
We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research and development expense was $47.3 million, $44.6 million, and $59.6 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
