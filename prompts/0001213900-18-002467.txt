History and Company Overview
 
We are one of the leading design and construction services firms using code-engineered cargo shipping containers for safe and sustainable construction. (“SG Blocks™”), in addition to our use of purpose-built modules (“SGPBMs” and, together with SG Blocks™, “Modules”), which are prefabricated steel modular units, as described further below. Our core customer base is comprised of architects, builders and developers who use our Modules in commercial and residential structures. Our operating model combines product design and outsourcing of the modifications and finish out of Modules using proprietary algorithms developed by the Company to produce and deliver Modules across the country. We believe this combination enables us to generate economies of scale while maintaining high customer service levels in the environmentally-friendly construction space.
 
The Company was originally known as CDSI Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 29, 1993. On November 4, 2011, CDSI Merger Sub, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary completed a reverse merger with and into SG Building Blocks, Inc. (“SG Building”), with SG Building surviving the reverse merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy in June 2016, the Company’s common stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. In June 2017, we completed a public offering of our new common stock, which currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SGBX.” See below under “Our Emergence from Bankruptcy” and “Public Offering of Common Stock.”
 
Description of Business
 
SGB is in the business of fabricating modules for construction of buildings using either modified cargo shipping containers for use in construction, or SG Blocks™, or SGPBMs, which are prefabricated steel modular units customized for use in modular construction primarily to augment or complement a SG Blocks™ structure.
 
When using SG BlocksTM, SGB takes existing steel shipping containers and repurposes them into modules that can be stacked, arranged, or configured to fit most structural applications. The use of these repurposed shipping containers allows architects, builders, and owners more design flexibility and greater construction efficiency than traditional methods of construction. SG BlocksTM also have a particular application in meeting safe, affordable and sustainable housing needs, especially in hurricane- and earthquake-prone areas.
 
When using SGPBMs, SGB starts with a design and customizes an engineered steel structure to customer design and specifications, primarily to augment or complement a SG BlocksTM structure.
 
The SGB product is generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. The use of the SG BlocksTM building structure typically provides between four to six points towards the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification levels, including reduced site disturbance, resource reuse, recycled content, innovation in design and use of local and regional materials. Due to the ability of SG BlocksTM to satisfy such requirements, we believe the Company is a leader in environmentally responsible building.
 
SGB offers three core products when constructing using SG BlocksTM.
 
First, we offer the GreenSteelTM Module which is the structural core and shell of an SG BlocksTM building. We procure the containers, engineer required openings with structural steel enforcements, paint the SG BlocksTM and then deliver them on-site, where a local general contractor will complete the entire finish-out and installation.
 
In our second offering, we replicate the process to create the GreenSteelTM product and, in addition, install selected materials, finishes and systems at an SGB-approved facility and deliver SG BlocksTM pre-fabricated containers to the site for a local general contractor to complete the final finish out and installation.
 
Finally, our third offering is the completely fabricated and finished SG BlocksTM building, including erecting the final unit on site and completing any other final steps. The building is ready for occupancy and/or use as soon as we complete the installation.
 
Construction administration and/or project management services are typically included in all our product offerings.
 
SGB’s process when using SGPBMs is generally the same as using SG BlocksTM, except that such SGPBMs are built specifically for use in modular construction, unlike the shipping containers repurposed and modified for use in construction.

In offering our Modules, we also provide a variety of services, from pre-development to completing turnkey projects that include delivering a finished building. Before building begins, we offer pre-development services, including zoning, site plans, engineering specifications and budgeting and collaborate with the customer in obtaining construction permits and general contractor selection, where necessary. During the building process, we can provide complete construction administration, project management, architectural, engineering and design support and quality control and inspection for the final structure, as well as co-development or support for existing buildings. We can also oversee the erection, cladding and finishes involved in the building process.
 
SGB uses a platform model, which enables us to leverage our technology and processes and maintain low overhead costs by partnering with third parties to reduce risks along the supply chain and optimize our offerings to our customers. Specifically, SGB outsources some or all of the following: architectural and engineering services, fabrication services, modular finish out, installation services and logistics services. This allows us to operate with relatively low fixed costs and gives us flexibility to scale our business response to fluctuating demand.
 
ESR Approval
 
In April 2017, the ICC Evaluation Service, LLC (“ICC-ES”) granted SGB an Evaluation Service Report (“ESR”) for the SG BlocksTM structural building materials, which we believe is the only ESR certification granted to date for a modular building company. The Company’s ESR indicates that the ICC-ES recognizes the suitability and technical capabilities of the SG BlocksTM structural building materials for use in compliance with the International Building Code and Residential Code, the California Building Code and Residential Code, and the Florida Building Code—Building and Residential. We believe SGB’s ESR will significantly expedite reviews and approvals by state and local building departments, help the SG BlocksTM concept gain wider acceptance in the construction industry and open up licensing opportunities internationally. We also believe the ESR will make it more difficult for other companies in the industry to compete with us because the quality control and design acceptance criteria are specific to SGB and our associated facilities.
 
SGB’s ESR is site-specific; therefore, only the inspected and approved facilities can place the ICC-ES mark on the containers. We currently source or fabricate our SG BlocksTM from 18 facilities located throughout the continental United States. The ICC-ES has currently approved six of these facilities to place the ICC-ES mark. SGB will seek ICC-ES approval for additional facilities on an as needed basis.
 
Because our ESR does not cover SGPBMs, this certification will not extend to buildings constructed using SGPBMs.
 
Target Markets
 
SGB targets its products and services within the new construction market in the United States. Our Modules have a particular application in a number of segments, including:

● | Multi-Family Housing 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Restaurants/Quick Service Restaurants 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Military
--+---------


● | Education/Student Housing 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equipment Enclosures and Stacking Solutions 
--+------------------------------------------------
● | Hospitality 
● | Industrial and Storage Facilities 

 
In addition, future target markets for expansion of our products and services include office/commercial, hospitality and entertainment, warehouse/public storage, shopping/retail centers, athletic facilities and support structures, reclamation/drop off centers and medical.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Although the construction industry is highly competitive, SGB is committed to educating the real estate community on the benefits of its technology and positioning our product as complementary to the strategy of developers, rather than as competition. SGB may compete for building opportunities with regional, national and international builders that possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than it does, and competition within the general construction industry may increase if there is future consolidation in the land development and construction industry or from new building technologies that could arise. Within the modular building space, we compete against a small number of companies providing modular-building services. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of building materials; technical product knowledge and expertise; consulting or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and the marketability of our ESR within the structural building space.
 
We believe SGB can distinguish itself from its competitors on the basis of our exclusive access to inventory, our ESR, quality, cost and construction time. SGB’s buildings are constructed through the connection of Modules into structures, which we believe exceed traditional construction quality. SGB’s construction method is typically less expensive than traditional construction methods, particularly in urban locations and multi-story projects. Construction time is also generally reduced by using SGB’s construction method, reducing both construction and soft costs substantially. SG BlocksTM are designed to be hurricane-, tornado- and earthquake-resistant and able to withstand harsh climate conditions. The flexibility and the stackability of our Modules allows architects, developers and owners to design Modules to meet their specific needs. In addition, SGB’s management team has a breadth of knowledge in the modular building industry with a combined 80 years of experience. Our experience in a wide range of construction applications, including office, enclosures, residential, commercial, QSR, experiential and restaurant applications, gives us an advantage over our competition through the use of market-based prototypes.
 
Our Customers
 
We market to a broad customer base, comprised primarily of contractors, home builders, building owners and other resellers across the continental United States and Canada. However, concentrations of credit risk are limited to a few customers. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 81% and 63%, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable were due from two and three customers, respectively. Revenue relating to two and three customers represented approximately 80% and 69% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No single customer accounts for more than 62% of our net sales as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Suppliers
 
Although the primary use of shipping containers is for transportation, when constructing SG Blocks™ we use standard materials to modify the container shell structure and finish out the modules. We utilize the same suppliers and materials used by conventional construction. Materials such as windows, doors, insulation mechanical systems, electrical systems and other such supplies are all off-the-shelf materials and equipment commonly available and used in the industry.
 
The main supplier for our containers is ConGlobal Industries, Inc. (“ConGlobal”) with whom SGB has an exclusive 10-year Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the “ConGlobal Agreement”) through May 14, 2024. ConGlobal is one of the largest depot operators in the United States. This arrangement provides SGB with a reliable source of supply of certified shipping containers and prevents competitors from sourcing shipping containers from ConGlobal. The ConGlobal Agreement provides that ConGlobal will not supply shipping containers modified for building purposes to any entity competing with SGB during the term of the agreement. The Company believes it has access to alternative suppliers, with limited disruption to the business, should circumstances change with its existing suppliers.
 
Our Emergence from Bankruptcy
 
On October 15, 2015, SGB and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption In re SG Blocks, Inc. et al., Case No. 15-12790. On February 29, 2016, the Debtors filed a Disclosure Statement (the “Disclosure Statement”), attaching a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”), along with a motion seeking approval of the Disclosure Statement by the Bankruptcy Court. On June 30, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.

Prior to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue: (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Common Stock”) of which 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016; and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Preferred Stock”), none of which were issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date.
 
On the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016, pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to Hillair Capital Investments L.P. (“HCI”) in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the “Exit Facility”). The Exit Facility and related transactions are described in more detail below in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 
On the Effective Date, all previously issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 163,901 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split) of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “New Common Stock”), to the holders of Former Common Stock. Further, under the Plan, upon the Effective Date, certain members of SGB’s management were entitled to receive options (the “Management Options”) to acquire approximately 218,384 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split), of SGB’s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis.
 
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and SGB’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SGB filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 1,801,670 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split) of preferred stock, par value $1.00, all of which were issued upon the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. Prior to the Company’s Public Offering, as defined below, all outstanding shares of the Company’s preferred stock, were converted into 1,801,670 shares of common stock. No preferred stock currently remains outstanding.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On February 28, 2017, the Company effected a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of its New Common Stock and preferred stock, which has since been converted into common stock. All share and per share amounts set forth in the consolidated financial statements of the Company have been retroactively restated to reflect the split as if it had occurred as of the earliest period presented.
Public Offering of Common Stock
 
On June 27, 2017, we completed a public offering of our common stock (the “Public Offering”). In connection with the Public Offering, we sold 1,500,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $6,826,558 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses of $673,442. On July 12, 2017, the underwriters of the Public Offering exercised their option to purchase an additional 225,000 shares of common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $1,046,250 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses of $78,750. In addition, the Company incurred additional expenses related to the offering in the amount of $813,195.
 
In connection with the Public Offering and as compensation to the underwriters, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 86,250 shares of the Company’s common stock, at an exercise price of $6.25 per share, to certain affiliates of the underwriters.
 
The Company incurred a total of $1,565,386 in issuance costs in connection with the Public Offering. 
 
Prior to and in connection with the Public Offering, the Company issued 516,667 shares of its common stock upon conversion of a portion of the Company’s outstanding debentures, consisting of the Exit Facility and a $937,500 Original Issue Discount Debenture sold to HCI in November 2016 for a subscription price of $750,000 (the “November 2016 OID” and, together with the Exit Facility, the “2016 Debentures”). The remaining outstanding amount of the 2016 Debentures, approximately $1.5 million, was repaid using a portion of the proceeds from the Public Offering. None of the 2016 Debentures remain outstanding.

Intellectual Property
 
We operate under our United States registered trademarks “SGBlocks®” and “GreenSteel” and our trademarked “SG” logo.
 
In addition, SGB has a United States patent application pending directed to a system and method for conversion of intermodal shipping containers to universal building modules. Specifically, the present invention (Universal Box) relates to prefabricated modular construction of a structure utilizing converted shipping containers.
 
SGB has also submitted a United States patent application for a portable blast containment and security checkpoint device intended for use at public events.
 
The two applications, described above have not yet been examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that the applications will mature into issued patents or, if they do mature into issued patents, that any claims that may be allowed will provide sufficient protection to exclude competitors from the market.
 
Government Regulation and Approval
 
The design and construction of buildings is controlled at the project level, with local and state municipalities having jurisdiction in most cases. All buildings, conventionally built or modularly built, are subject to published building codes and criteria that must be achieved during the architectural and engineering phase in order to be approved for construction. There are no specific regulations that impact our products. Rather, they are subject to published criteria on a case-by-case basis at the project level, like all other types of construction.
 
While much of the regulation in our industry occurs at the project level, we are subject to various federal, state and local government regulations applicable to the business in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We strive to operate each of our branches in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and, in addition, that our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices comply with related regulations.
 
In April 2017, the ICC-ES granted SGB an ESR for the SG BlocksTM structural building materials, which we believe is the only ESR certification granted to date for a modular building company. We believe SGB’s ESR will significantly expedite reviews and approvals by state and local building departments, help the SG BlocksTM concept gain wider acceptance in the construction industry and open up licensing opportunities internationally.
 
Research and Development Costs
 
SGB research and development needs were largely met in-house by a professional engineer and have not required us to pay material amounts to third parties.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, SGB directly employed seven full-time employees and one part-time employee and engaged outside professional firms and subcontractors to deliver projects to customers.
