ITEM 1. BUSINESS
American Public Education, Inc., or APEI, provides online and on-campus postsecondary education to approximately 85,500 students through two wholly owned subsidiary institutions. In this Annual Report, “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and similar terms refer to APEI and its subsidiary institutions collectively unless the context indicates otherwise.
This Item 1 of our Annual Report contains a “Company Overview” section that provides information about our subsidiary institutions, reporting segments, our history, the postsecondary educational market, competition, competitive strengths, strategic approach, executive officers, seasonality and available information. Item 1 also contains a section entitled “Our Institutions” that provides institution specific information regarding each of our two subsidiary institutions, and a “Regulatory Environment” section that provides information on some of the regulations that impact postsecondary educational institutions.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Subsidiary Institutions
Our institutions of higher learning offer programs designed to help students advance in their current occupation, or prepare for their next career, and develop the competencies that enable them to make meaningful contributions to their profession and society. Our wholly owned operating subsidiary institutions include:

• | American Public University System, Inc., or APUS, provides online postsecondary education to approximately 83,400 adult learners. APUS is an accredited university system with a history of serving the academic needs of the military, military-affiliated and public service communities through two brands: American Military University, or AMU, and American Public University, or APU.

APUS offers 108 degree programs and 109 certificate programs in diverse fields of study, including business administration, health science, technology, criminal justice, education and liberal arts, as well as national security, military studies, intelligence, and homeland security. APUS employs approximately 370 full-time faculty members and 1,550 part-time faculty members and has regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC. 
Although APUS’s focus has expanded, the institution continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 54% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment. 

• | National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, provides nursing education to approximately 2,100 students at five campuses in Ohio, as well as online. HCN offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing and an Associate Degree in Nursing. The campuses are located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Toledo. HCN also offers an online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing program, or the RN-to-BSN Program, predominantly to students in Ohio.

HCN is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS, and the RN-to-BSN Program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, or CCNE. HCN’s locations and programs are approved by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools and the RN-to-BSN Program is approved by the Ohio Department of Higher Education. In addition, the Diploma in Practical Nursing and Associate Degree in Nursing programs, or the PN and ADN Programs, are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing. The RN-to-BSN Program is fully online, while portions of the PN and ADN Programs are online. HCN employs approximately 105 full-time faculty members and 40 part-time faculty members.

Our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $299.2 million from $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income was $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Financial information regarding each of our reporting segments, including information regarding segment revenue, net income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years, can be found in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report; financial information is reported in this Annual Report in “Selected Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
Our History
In 1991, retired Marine Corps officer James P. Etter founded American Military University, or AMU, in Virginia offering distance graduate education to a mobile population of adult learners in the military with unique needs. Over time, undergraduate and graduate programs were added to help prepare students for leadership roles in both military and post-military careers.
In 2002, AMU was reorganized into a holding company and APEI was formed and incorporated in Delaware as the parent of APUS, which was organized with two components: AMU and American Public University, or APU, which was created to provide the same quality, affordable and flexible education to a broader audience of adult learners.
In 2003, APUS moved to its current home in Charles Town, West Virginia.
In 2006, APUS received regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC.
In 2007, APEI became a publicly-traded company on NASDAQ.
In 2011, HLC reaffirmed accreditation for APUS through the 2020-2021 academic year.
In 2013, APEI acquired HCN, with campuses located in Ohio. 
In 2017, APUS began accepting applications to applied doctoral programs in Strategic Intelligence and Global Security.
Today, APUS is dedicated to preparing students for career advancement, service and leadership by offering a broad array of affordable online academic programs to students enrolled worldwide, including Associate, Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctoral degrees, and Undergraduate and Graduate certificates. 
Postsecondary Education Market Characteristics and Opportunities
The postsecondary education market in the United States is large, with over 4,000 institutions, diverse in its business models and fragmented such that no one institution has a significant market share. Most postsecondary institutions, including for-profit postsecondary institutions, regardless of where they are located, how they are organized, and who they serve, face significant challenges, including: 

• | a continued focus on the cost of a college education and the resulting impact on access;


• | concerns over the high level of college student indebtedness;


• | questions about the quality of academic programs and the ability to translate the value of a postsecondary education into economic mobility;


• | competition from lower cost alternatives and from non-traditional competitors, such as those offering coding bootcamps, micro-credentials, and other new alternative educational paths; and


• | the importance of preparing students with relevant skills to manage new and rapidly changing technologies and supporting employers in efforts to optimize and advance their workforce.

With nearly 2.1 million active-duty military and reservists, we believe the U.S. military community will continue to be a significant market for online education. Because of irregular schedules, geographic mobility and access to tuition assistance funding, we believe service members will continue to seek respected universities that provide military-focused support services coupled with an online curriculum that is designed to prepare graduates for both career advancement and employment outside 
2

of the military. As part of their longstanding tradition, military leaders often encourage service members to use their earned education benefits, and to enhance their qualifications for purposes of the military’s compensation, promotion, assignment, and performance systems.
We believe that military veterans represent another important market for online education. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were an estimated 1.6 million veterans aged 18 to 35 and another 4.5 million veterans aged 35 to 54 in 2015. Furthermore, approximately 76% of the 18.5 million veterans are still in the labor force and approximately 28% of veterans have a bachelor’s degree or higher. We believe that our military heritage, affordability and online offerings are attractive to veterans in the pursuit of career advancement and employment outside of the military. Veterans pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance equal to 50% of the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents, or $840.50 per month.
Elected and private-industry leaders are heavily promoting new policies and campaigns to facilitate the hiring of veterans, supporting a transition from military service to the workforce and stimulating demand for online education. As these policies lower barriers to non-military jobs and facilitate veteran-owned businesses winning federal contracts, online universities offer valuable educational opportunities for constituents regardless of where they live, work or learn.
The Department of Defense, or DoD, uniform tuition assistance policy offers service members a variety of education and financial aid options. Additionally, veterans (and certain service members) are entitled to educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA. For more information, refer to “Our Institutions” and “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.”
 On a national level, the expanding healthcare sector is driving demand for nursing education. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2017-18 Edition, job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses are expected to grow approximately 12% between 2016 and 2026, faster than the average growth for all occupations. The demand for nurses in Ohio is similar to national demand. According to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services’ 2024 Ohio Job Outlook report, job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses are expected to grow 20.1% and 13.7%, respectively. Despite anticipated growth in job opportunities, a 2017 report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing stated that over 64,000 qualified applications were not accepted by entry-level baccalaureate programs at nursing schools in 2016. These statistics suggest there may be unmet demand from qualified students for nursing educational programs.
U.S. employers are increasingly reporting significant gaps between required job skills and the current capabilities of their workforce. According to a 2017 survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder, 68% of employers who said they were increasing their number of full-time permanent employees in the first quarter of 2017 currently had open positions for which they could not find qualified candidates. The National Federation of Independent Businesses recently found that as of the first quarter of 2017, 45% of small businesses reported that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job openings. According to a 2017 survey by national staffing company Adecco, 92% of executives surveyed felt that American workers are not as skilled as they need to be. We believe a growing number of employers and professional associations will seek partnerships with academic institutions to advance the skills and productivity of their workforce through higher education and training programs. 
Competition
Within the postsecondary education market, APUS competes primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. We believe APUS’s primary competitors include: Ashford University, Capella University, Grand Canyon University, Liberty University, Southern New Hampshire University, Strayer University, University of Maryland University College, and flagship and mid-size state universities offering degree programs online.  
We believe that the competitive factors in the U.S. postsecondary education market include:

• | quality of the academic program, including alignment to high growth sectors of the job market;


• | affordability;


• | breadth of degree offerings;


• | flexibility in delivery models;


• | frequent starts;


• | experienced faculty members engaged in the practice of their fields;

3


• | level of support for student success;


• | reputation among prospective students, employers and other stakeholders;


• | effectiveness of marketing efforts in attracting college-ready students; and


• | strong compliance track record.

HCN’s programs are largely offered as campus-based programs to residents in the geographic areas where it has campuses. In these geographic areas, HCN competes with other schools offering nursing programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private colleges. Because of its geographic focus, HCN’s competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific not only to Ohio but also to the particular areas of Ohio where campuses are located, including in terms of the local supply of and demand for both nurses and nursing schools. As a result of HCN’s geographic focus, HCN’s results are also more susceptible than an institution that draws from a broader geographical area to the actions of single competitors. Because HCN’s RN-to-BSN Program is offered online, HCN also competes in a broader market against other online nursing programs.
Our institutions continue to face significant competition and other challenges. These challenges include those related to federal policies governing for-profit institutions and financial aid that either apply only to for-profit institutions and exclude not-for-profit and public education, such as the 90/10 Rule, or that in effect impose more restrictions on for-profit institutions than on not-for-profit and public institutions based on the nature of the requirements, such as gainful employment regulations. 

Most public institutions are aided by substantial government subsidies. Public and private not-for-profit institutions, benefit from government and foundation grants, tax-exempt status, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources not widely available to for-profit institutions. Many public competitors also benefit from longstanding name recognition and are able to directly recruit students in a more cost-effective manner, especially in their local markets. 
We expect that our institutions will face greater competition from an increasing number of educational institutions shifting their delivery models to include online education programs and other non-traditional offerings. In recent years, other institutions, including competing institutions, have started providing non-traditional, credit-bearing and non-credit-bearing education programs without charge or at a low cost. We have also observed an increase in institutions offering competency-based education programs, or CBE programs, which permit students to control their own pace in a program by demonstrating that they have achieved certain skills or knowledge rather than by earning credit hours.
 We believe that our institutions will continue to face new competition from CBE and other non-traditional programs, including competition from lower cost alternatives. Additionally, non-traditional competitors, such as entities providing coding bootcamps and micro-credentials, are offering new alternative educational paths. While we are working to develop our own alternatives in some of these areas, including the launch in the first quarter of 2017 of MomentumTM, a CBE program at APUS, there are other institutions with programs that are more fully developed. Further, our CBE offerings may not receive market acceptance. Although APUS has applied for approval to offer Title IV program aid to students enrolled in MomentumTM programs, those programs are not currently approved for the purposes of Title IV programs, and we cannot be certain that they will qualify for access to Title IV programs. Our institutions may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect their business or results of operations. These competitive factors could cause our institutions’ enrollments, revenue, and profitability to decrease significantly.
Within the postsecondary education market generally, we anticipate increased competition as the number of online degree programs and other non-traditional offerings continues to increase, the total number of students as well as the number of students aged 25 and over continues to decline, capacity in the postsecondary education market increases, and market consolidation occurs. Although we are taking steps designed to overcome these challenges, continued declines in the number of adult students enrolled in postsecondary institutions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For more information on competition within the postsecondary education market, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Attracting and Retaining Students.”
Competitive Strengths
Today’s adult learners, whether military or civilian, are often working with extended or irregular work schedules, have family obligations, travel or relocate frequently, and have limited financial resources. 
A 2015 Lumina Foundation study described today’s postsecondary students, who in many cases:

• | are older than 25 and are juggling more than just education


◦ | 38% of college students today are older than 25

4


◦ | 25% are raising children while pursuing their education


• | are trying to fit college alongside work obligations


◦ | 58% are working while they are enrolled


◦ | 40% attend school part-time


• | are balancing living expenses with the rising average national cost of college


◦ | 42% of today’s college students are living near or below the poverty line


◦ | 25% of recipients of a Bachelor’s degree graduate with at least $24,000 in debt


• | are struggling to graduate


◦ | 53% of student-parents leave college with no degree


◦ | 11% of low-income, first-generation college students had attained a bachelor’s degree within six years

While many institutions are struggling to determine how to meet the needs of today’s students, both APUS and HCN have been successfully serving students with these profiles since their founding.  
The sources of our institutions’ competitive strengths include: 

• | Academic Relevance and Excellence. Both APUS and HCN offer programs aligned to areas of high growth in the job market as supported by data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and non-governmental organizations. This is particularly true in the healthcare, technology and business sectors, and in cybersecurity, nursing and health information management programs. APUS also offers a liberal arts curriculum that develops the “soft skills” in demand by employers. APUS utilizes Industry Advisory Councils, or IACs, to evaluate and inform the career relevance of programs and degrees. This facilitates efforts to connect APUS’s curriculum to the industries and the students it serves and to deliver a high-quality academic product. The depth and breadth of APUS’s program offerings are designed to effectively address the diverse needs of students who enter into education programs with vastly different educational and career backgrounds and goals. Similarly, HCN focuses on educational relevance and excellence by hiring experienced industry professionals as faculty members while enhancing student services to assist students with courses, labs, and clinical offerings. HCN’s faculty includes individuals with research experience and specialized nursing credentials. HCN has invested in an innovative concept-based curriculum and simulation labs to enhance the student learning experience and improve student success. Our institutions are committed to continually assessing and enhancing our academic programs and our student services to offer a high-quality education and support successful outcomes for our students and graduates.


• | Affordable Tuition. From its founding, APUS set tuition to align with tuition assistance programs available to members of the military and today, tuition at APUS remains among the lowest in the sector, therefore not requiring students to take on as much indebtedness as they might at another institution. The combined tuition and fees at APUS are, in almost every case, less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. This, when combined with APUS’s undergraduate book grant, which is provided to all undergraduate students, results in significant savings for students. For nearly 15 years, APUS did not increase undergraduate tuition. Following a tuition increase that was effective in July 2015, undergraduate tuition at APUS is $270 per credit hour, or $810 per three-credit course. A full 121-credit hour undergraduate degree may be earned for $32,670 in tuition costs at current tuition rates. Following the July 2015 tuition increase, APUS’s graduate tuition is $350 per credit hour, or $1,050 per three-credit course, which means many APUS graduate degrees may be earned for $12,600 in tuition at current rates. APUS provides a tuition grant to support students who are U.S. Military active-duty service members, National Guard, reservists, military spouses and dependents, and veterans. For such individuals, tuition is set at pre-July 2015 rates, with undergraduate course tuition at $250 per credit hour, and graduate course tuition at $325 per credit hour. APUS estimates that the tuition grant applied to approximately 75% of its total net course registrations in 2016 and 2017. Because of the tuition grant, 100% of APUS’s undergraduate tuition is covered by DoD tuition assistance and approximately 80% of graduate tuition is covered. Tuition and fees at HCN are also designed to be affordable and competitive with those of similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility, accessibility, and student experience.


• | Flexible Delivery and Frequent Entry Points, Focused on Adult Learners. APUS designs courses and programs specifically for online delivery. APUS recruits and prepares its faculty exclusively to deliver online instruction. Because students are located worldwide, APUS focuses on providing asynchronous, interactive education to students that fits their busy lives. APUS offers monthly starts, giving students the opportunity to begin their studies at a time that works for them. Our academic support offerings, from advising and mentoring to library services and career planning, are individualized to students’ needs, designed to support them at each step of their education journey and in

5

a format that works best for them. These offerings range from self-service access to resources and virtual career fair events to live video chats and personalized coaching sessions with experts in the applicable discipline. HCN offers programs that accommodate working adults by offering blended online and in-person courses for the PN and ADN Programs, daytime and evening/weekend options for in-person classes, and a fully online RN-to-BSN Program. .
Strategic Approach
In an effort to grow revenue and improve our financial performance, we are employing the following strategies: 

• | Enrollment Stabilization at APUS. Student enrollment at APUS has declined in recent periods. Stabilizing student enrollment at APUS is a priority. APUS plans to continue developing and executing strategies and initiatives aimed at increasing enrollment of college-ready students and further improving student retention. This may include launching new marketing initiatives to become more efficient at reaching online audiences, as well as reengineering various enrollment management processes for more efficient student on-boarding and improved customer service.


• | Further Improve Student Outcomes. We are focused on attracting applicants who are prepared for the rigors of higher education and capable of successfully completing courses and graduating from our programs. We also provide services designed to improve student persistence, increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom, and deliver interventions designed to help students succeed.


• | Maintain Our Leading Position in the Military and Veteran Market. APUS has focused on the needs of the U.S. military community since being founded as AMU. The combination of our online model, focused curriculum, and outreach to military and veterans has enabled APUS to maintain a leadership position against more established institutions, many of which are traditional schools offering on-campus instruction that have served the military market for longer periods. APUS remains firmly committed to providing exceptional service and support to the military, and military-affiliated communities.


• | Increase APUS’s Share of the Civilian Market. APUS designs its curriculum to be broadly relevant to adult learners. APUS is particularly responsive to learners in public service communities, including public safety and security professions. Today’s adult learners, regardless of their specific career requirements, are looking for a highly-tailored educational experience that prepares them for success. APUS’s academic offerings are attractive options for students seeking high quality, affordable and flexible programs.


• | Increase Alignment to Job Market Needs. Our institutions will continue exploring opportunities to enhance degree offerings to meet emerging needs and marketplace demands, with a focus on fields of study exhibiting higher than average job growth and new degree programs that are relevant to the workplace. Our institutions will also continue to consider alternatives and non-traditional offerings, including corporate training and competency-based programs aligned to the job market and requiring less time to complete.


• | Add New Campus Locations at HCN. HCN will continue exploring opportunities to add new campus locations to meet the needs of students and marketplace demands.


• | Expand Strategic Partnerships. Our institutions partner with corporations, government agencies, professional associations and non-profit organizations to support their professional and workforce development initiatives. APUS provides more than 200 partner organizations with a range of services to maximize strategic workforce development goals, including dedicated client services, admissions support, custom program webpages, direct payment options for eligible institutions, and tuition grants. HCN partners with more than 300 healthcare facilities, through corporate and local agreements, to provide clinical experiences for HCN students, meet partners’ workforce needs, and work collaboratively to chart the future of nursing education in a community advisory capacity.


• | Utilize Innovative Education Technology. We provide a personalized online learning environment that leverages existing and proprietary technologies, as well as emerging technologies, for the purpose of enhancing student services, classroom instruction, learning outcomes and the overall student experience. We utilize various technologies to encourage student persistence and engagement across all computing devices with an emphasis on the mobile experience.

To support growth in our existing businesses and to diversify our business model, we will continue to assess and pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. Examples of our investments and acquisitions include: 
6


• | New Horizons Worldwide, Inc. In September 2012, we made a $6.8 million equity investment and a $6.0 million debt investment in a holding company that acquired New Horizons, a global information technology training company operating over 300 locations around the world through franchise arrangements covering approximately 70 countries. In connection with the investment we acquired approximately 20% of the fully diluted equity of the New Horizons holding company and are entitled to certain rights, including rights to representation on the Board of Directors of the holding company. In December 2014, the New Horizons holding company prepaid the $6.0 million debt investment we made in connection with the transaction. In 2016, we received a $3.0 million dividend from the New Horizons holding company. We account for our investment in the New Horizons holding company using the equity method of accounting, and therefore recorded a corresponding reduction in the amount of our investment.


• | Hondros College of Nursing. In November 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as HCN, for an approximate adjusted aggregate purchase price of $46.8 million. As described more fully elsewhere in this Annual Report, HCN offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing, and an Associate Degree in Nursing through five campuses in Ohio and an online RN-to-BSN Program.


• | RallyPoint. In December 2015, we made a $3.5 million investment in preferred stock of RallyPoint Networks, Inc., or RallyPoint, an online social network for members of the military. Our investment represented approximately 14% of its fully diluted equity and entitled APEI to two board observer seats. In October 2017, we made an additional $300,000 investment in preferred stock of RallyPoint. This additional investment maintained our fully diluted ownership and we continue to be entitled to two board observer seats.

Our strategy for future investments includes focusing on investing in healthcare education and in companies that bridge postsecondary education to employment, delivering on the promise to enable economic mobility for adult learners, in particular those in the military, national security and public service communities, through a combination of educational offerings and workforce-related solutions.
For additional information regarding these and our other investments and acquisitions, please refer to the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
Our quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments. Our student population also varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these factors. 
Available Information About Us

APEI was incorporated in Delaware in 2002, as the successor to a Virginia corporation incorporated in 1991. Our website is www.americanpubliceducation.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. 
OUR INSTITUTIONS
We provide postsecondary education through two subsidiary institutions, APUS and HCN. Our institutions are licensed or otherwise authorized by state authorities, or are in the process of obtaining such licenses or authorizations, to offer postsecondary education programs to the extent the institutions believe such licenses or authorizations are required, and are certified by the U.S. Department of Education, or ED, to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or Title IV.
American Public University System
APUS is based in Charles Town, WV and has regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC. APUS traces its roots to AMU, which was founded in 1991 as a distance-learning, graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. APUS has gradually broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, public service, and certain other non-military communities with a focus on a broad purpose of “educating those who serve.” In 2002, APUS was organized into a university system with two components: American Military University, or AMU, and American Public University, or APU. AMU is focused on educating students from the military, national security, military- affiliated and public service communities. APU is focused on educating career-focused working adults with an emphasis on educating professionals working in public service related communities. APUS is an online institution of higher learning, which we believe is well-suited to its students, especially its military, public service and working adult students, who serve in positions requiring extended and irregular work schedules, are on call for rapid response missions, participate in extended deployments and exercises, travel or relocate frequently, balance family and work demands and may be single parents with limited financial resources. Many APUS students have significant prior education and career experiences, 88% are working adults and the average age of its students is 33. APUS is designed to serve those students with tailored offerings to support them in successfully reaching their individual goals.
Although APUS’s focus has broadened, it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 54% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on 
8

active duty at the time of initial enrollment. The remainder of APUS’s students are military-affiliated professionals (such as veterans, reservists or National Guard members), public service professionals (such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders) and other civilians (such as military spouses and working adult students).

APUS offers 109 certificate programs. APUS’s certificate programs generally consist of a minimum of 18 credit hours and focus on a particular component of a broader degree program. Students may earn discrete certificates or earn certificates in combination with work toward a degree program. APUS also offers several Learning Tracks comprised of a two-week “Classroom Success” orientation course about online learning and three academic courses in a related area of interest. A Learning Track allows students to pursue a course of study without having to commit to a degree or certificate program. In the first quarter of 2017, APUS launched MomentumTM, its Competency Based Education Program. Competency Based Education, or CBE, focuses on the achievement of knowledge and skills, providing a more flexible degree path to non-traditional students seeking an alternative to prevailing schedule and tuition constraints.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, 25% of APUS students were enrolled in security and global studies programs, 24% in business, and 22% in arts and humanities, with the remainder of students in science, technology, education and math, health sciences, and education programs. During that period, 59% of students were enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program, 16% in an associate degree program, 16% in a master’s degree program, and 9% in certificate or other programs.

Student Recruitment and Marketing

APUS’s relationship-based marketing strategy focuses on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military, military-affiliated and public service communities. The core of this strategy is rooted in our outreach teams, which serve these communities and foster long-standing relationships. We believe APUS’s reputation as a trusted educator positions APUS as a respected institution among certain federal and private sector employers. These relationships, as well as APUS’s student and alumni networks, also cultivates personal referrals. We believe that this relationship-based marketing approach enables APUS to achieve lower student acquisition costs than otherwise would be achieved if it focused more heavily on traditional media advertising.
APUS supplements relationship-based marketing with multichannel marketing campaigns to create greater brand awareness, particularly for the APU brand outside the military, military-affiliated, and public service communities, and to connect with and attract academically prepared potential students. In these campaigns, APUS utilizes digital marketing channels such as organic and paid search, APUS owned and external content marketing communities, traditional and digital TV, radio, print advertising, and social media, among others. This aspect of APUS’s marketing strategy, along with increased competition and more investment in marketing the less well known APU brand, has resulted in increased student acquisition costs. To better manage costs and focus marketing efforts on prospective student audiences most likely to matriculate and succeed, APUS put in place tools to provide new insights connecting individual student performance data with the marketing channel that attracted them. APUS is using these insights to improve future decisions with respect to marketing mix allocation, audience targeting, new initiatives, and messaging decisions. 
APUS continues to enhance the student learning experience to attract students who are more likely to persist and succeed in its programs, and will continue to work to identify and implement potential changes and initiatives that will more effectively attract and enroll more college-ready students. Such initiatives may include altering admissions standards, which may have an adverse effect on APUS’s enrollment and our financial condition. For additional information on the risk factors associated with such initiatives and the APUS admissions process please refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.” 
Student Body and Enrollment
The student body of APUS consists of approximately 83,400 enrolled students, most of whom hold full-time employment. Student enrollment is defined as the number of unique active students, including those who take an approved leave of absence for up to two years, who have reached the eighth day of their first course or who have completed at least one course within the last 12 months for which a grade was received.
APUS is focused on identifying potential changes and initiatives that will more effectively support its students and help improve those students’ educational outcomes, including through faculty engagement initiatives and co-curricular initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom and strengthen the bond between APUS and its students. Improved engagement is an important element in APUS’s goal of retaining qualified students.
Accreditation
APUS has regional accreditation from HLC. HLC accredits degree-granting institutions in a 19-state region, including West Virginia, and is recognized by the Department of Education, or ED. The status and meaning of this accreditation is described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.”

In addition to regional accreditation by HLC, certain programs offered by APUS have received specialized accreditations or professional recognition. For example, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, or ACBSP, accredits 19 different academic programs, including the following:
•Associate of Science, Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Accounting;
•Associate of Arts, Bachelor and Master of Business Administration;
•Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in Hospitality Management;
•Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Arts in Management; 
•Associate of Arts in Real Estate Studies; 
•Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in Retail Management; 
•Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Reverse Logistics Management; 
•Bachelor of Arts in Marketing; and
•Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Transportation and Logistics Management.
11

In addition to the general ACBSP accreditation, our Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Accounting hold specialized Accounting accreditation from ACBSP. 
The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, or CCNE, accredits the Bachelor and Masters of Science in Nursing program. In addition, APUS has obtained professional recognition for its program concentrations in Human Resources from the Society for Human Resource Management, for certain courses in the Sports and Health Sciences program from the American Sport Education Program for Bronze Level Certification and the National Academy of Sports Medicine Performance Enhancement Specialist, for the Information Systems Security program from the National Security Agency - Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation, and for certain courses in the Human Development and Family Studies program from the National Council on Family Relations for the Certified Family Life Educator. 
In July 2017, the Council on Education for Public Health, or CEPH, notified APUS that the CEPH Board of Councilors acted in June 2017 to accredit the Master of Public health program for a five-year term, extending until July 1, 2022.
These accreditations and recognitions are described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.”

Student Admissions 
APUS welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time through an online application process. The current qualifications for most undergraduate programs are a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. Applicants for graduate programs must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited U.S. institution or an equivalent foreign institution. Certain programs may have additional admissions standards and restrictions. Following admission students are issued a student ID number and password, and are provided information on how to finalize their admission and apply for evaluation of transfer credits. Students are also provided information on how to register for courses, arrange for payment and navigate the online student environment. 
In April 2017, APUS continued to strengthen its verification process by implementing new procedures for prospective non-military students, an effort that originated in April 2015 with the implementation of a requirement for prospective students to complete a free, noncredit admissions assessment. APUS has made multiple changes to the assessment process since its original implementation and may further modify it in the future in order to better identify college-ready students. For example, in July 2017, APUS implemented a process requiring enhanced verification of prospective non-military students’ prior transcripts. These initiatives require significant time, energy and resources, and if our efforts are not successful, they may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Even if these initiatives successfully lead to the identification and enrollment of students who are likely to succeed and improving student experience, they could result in adverse impacts on APUS enrollments. 
Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid
We believe that APUS’s ability to offer affordable programs is one of its competitive strengths. Many APUS students also transfer a significant number of previously earned academic credit hours, which reduces the length of time required to earn their degrees, and therefore reduces the cost of the degree, as well.
In July 2015, APUS increased undergraduate and graduate tuition by approximately 8%. Undergraduate tuition at APUS is now $270 per credit hour, or $810 per three-credit course. In general, a bachelor’s degree may be earned for $32,670 in tuition costs at current tuition rates. APUS’s graduate tuition is now $350 per credit hour, or $1,050 per three-credit course, which means many APUS graduate degrees may be earned for $12,600 in tuition at current tuition rates. The combined tuition, fees and books at APUS are designed to be less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. APUS provides a tuition grant to support students who are U.S. Military active-duty service members, National Guard, reservists, military spouses and dependents, and veterans. For such individuals, tuition is set at the pre-July 2015 rates, with undergraduate course tuition at $250 per credit hour, and graduate course tuition at $325 per credit hour. APUS estimates that the military tuition grant applied to approximately 75% of its 2016 and 2017 total net course registrations. 
The July 2015 tuition increase was APUS’s first undergraduate tuition increase since 2000, and the first graduate tuition increase in four years. According to the Department of Education’s College Affordability and Transparency Center, for 2015-2016 (the most recent data available), APUS was listed as the institution with the twenty-first lowest tuition and the fourteenth lowest net price. APUS’s net price was 47% less than the national average net price of private for-profit, four-year or above institutions. 
12

Undergraduate students enrolled in courses for academic credit receive their textbooks and certain course materials at no additional cost to them through a book-grant program. This book grant represents an approximate savings over the course of a student’s undergraduate degree program of $5,000 as compared to public four-year colleges and universities according to comparative information from The College Board’s Trends in College Pricing 2017 report. APUS also utilizes open access and online library materials where appropriate and works with various publishers to reduce the cost of textbooks and course materials for both undergraduate students receiving the book grant and for graduate students who pay for textbooks and course materials. 
In July 2017, APUS began accepting applications for two applied doctoral programs in Strategic Intelligence and Global Security. The first cohorts began in January 2018. The programs meet the need for higher-level education and research combined with professional practice in these fields. The doctoral degrees tuition and residency costs range from $5,005 to $6,675 per term and include a book grant for course materials. APUS doctoral degrees may be earned for between $50,054 and $60,054 in tuition at current tuition rates. 
APUS does not charge an admission fee or fees for services such as registration, course drops or similar events that trigger fees at many other institutions. Because APUS is an exclusively online institution, there are no required resident fees, such as for parking, food service, student union, and recreation. APUS charges students a technology fee, but provides a grant to cover the technology fee for students using DoD tuition assistance programs. When applicable, APUS students are charged certain additional fees, such as graduation, late registration, transcript request, and comprehensive examination fees.
DoD tuition assistance programs cover $750 of the tuition costs per course or $250 per credit hour for military students, and these students may also be able to use VA education benefits or aid from ED’s Title IV programs to cover any remaining cost, as described more fully below in “Sources of Student Financing” and “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.” APUS has set its tuition grant so that the DoD tuition assistance program covers the full tuition cost of undergraduate courses for members of the military up to the annual maximum benefit. 
Sources of Student Financing
APUS’s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, DoD tuition assistance programs, ED’s Title IV programs, VA education benefits, private loans, state and federal grants, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. Students utilizing DoD’s tuition assistance programs accounted for 37%, those utilizing ED’s Title IV programs 27%, and those using VA education benefits 23% of APUS’s net course registrations in 2017, and we believe that the ability of our students to participate in these programs is essential to APUS’s success. Participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs, ED’s Title IV programs and VA education benefits add to APUS’s regulatory burden, as described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.” Participation in these programs means that changes to or interruptions in federal appropriations for these programs or other actions by the federal government will impact APUS’s operations and our financial condition. 
As described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Recent Legislative and ED Activity - Federal Legislative Activity - Sequestration and Budgetary Matters,” in March 2013, in response to automatic across-the-board reductions in federal spending, also known as sequestration, the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps announced the suspension of their tuition assistance programs. Congress subsequently approved legislation requiring DoD to restore its tuition assistance programs, and each branch of the military restored its tuition assistance program. The DoD tuition assistance programs were again temporarily suspended during the October 2013 U.S. government partial shutdown. As a result of continued uncertainty about the availability of funding, several of the military branches announced changes to their tuition assistance programs that took effect in federal fiscal year 2014. For example, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance and has reduced the total benefit per service member per year from $4,500 to $4,000, the Coast Guard has also reduced total per service member annual benefits, and the Marine Corps now requires Marines to have 24 months on active duty prior to being eligible to apply for tuition assistance. Additional changes to the tuition assistance programs could occur, including due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes.
Funding for the federal government, including the DoD, lapsed on January 20, 2018, and the federal government partially shut down for a few days. On January 22, 2017, Congress enacted a continuing resolution to extend funding for the federal government, including the DoD, through February 8, 2018. Funding for the federal government lapsed again on February 9, 2018, resulting in a government shutdown that lasted for several hours. Later on February 9, 2018, Congress enacted a continuing resolution to extend funding for the federal government through March 23, 2018; however, if funding is 
13

not extended beyond that date a government shutdown could occur resulting in a suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs. A government shutdown or suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. For instance, on October 1, 2013, prior to the government shutdown and temporary suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs, APUS’s course registrations for October 2013 were approximately 41,200. However, as of October 14, 2013, approximately 13,100 registrations had been dropped, resulting in a net course registration reduction of approximately 20% compared to October 2012. We believe that many of these dropped registrations resulted from the suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs. After the government shutdown ended, DoD resumed its tuition assistance programs; however, we do not believe that APUS’s registrations for subsequent periods replaced all of the dropped registrations.
We do not know what future action may be taken with respect to DoD tuition assistance programs, which could include eliminating those programs, reducing the funds or benefits (or both) available under those programs, or enacting new restrictions on participation in those programs. Any such changes, or any other reductions in the funding for DoD tuition assistance programs, could have a material adverse effect on APUS’s enrollments and our financial condition. The potential risks associated with these and similar events are described more fully below in “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.”
Faculty and Staff
APUS’s faculty consists of approximately 1,920 full and part-time faculty members with relevant teaching and practitioner experience. The institution also employs professional staff of approximately 910 non-faculty employees to administer APUS’s academic, technology, service and business operations. Most of APUS’s non-faculty employees are based at either its headquarters in Charles Town, West Virginia, or at its administrative offices in Manassas, Virginia. None of APUS’s employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that APUS has a good relationship with its employees.
APUS has approximately 370 full-time faculty members with the remainder designated as part-time. APUS establishes full-time and part-time positions based on program and course enrollment. Many of APUS’s full-time faculty began their careers with APUS as part-time faculty. We expect that APUS’s faculty headcount and the composition of full-time and part-time faculty will vary with fluctuations in enrollment.
We believe that APUS’s well-regarded faculty, which includes many former and current practitioners in their fields, attracts new students to APUS. A significant majority of APUS’s graduate faculty members hold terminal degrees or doctorates in their relevant fields, and virtually all undergraduate faculty members hold graduate degrees. Exceptions have been granted for a limited number of APUS’s faculty members who do not meet degree standards and who provide evidence of significant experience and achievement in the field of study that they teach, according to APUS faculty quality guidelines. Many APUS faculty members have relevant experience at other universities and within military, corporate and government institutions. 
We believe that the quality of APUS’s faculty is critical to the student experience and student outcomes and is therefore vital to APUS’s success. APUS regularly reviews the performance of its faculty by, among other things, monitoring the online contact that faculty has with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. If APUS determines that a faculty member is not performing at an acceptable level, it works with the faculty member to improve performance by assigning the faculty member a mentor, providing additional training and/or coaching the faculty member for success. If the faculty member’s performance does not improve, APUS will no longer employ that faculty member to teach. APUS does not offer its faculty tenure.
We believe that the composition of APUS’s student body and curriculum are particularly attractive to potential faculty members because of the opportunity to teach relevant material to students who can implement higher education learning at their workplaces. APUS recruits faculty members through referrals by current faculty members, advertisements in higher education and trade association journals and its internet presence. Upon selection for a position, APUS requires each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification to teach at APUS and assignment to courses. All faculty participate in annual faculty-development opportunities and requirements.

Information Technology
APUS has invested significant capital and resources into developing proprietary information systems and processes to support what we refer to as Partnership At a Distance™, or PAD. PAD is APUS’s platform for interacting with its students. PAD is an information system designed to enable APUS to provide each student with individualized support at appropriate times from pre-enrollment through and beyond graduation, including student advising, administrative support, and community networking.
APUS uses Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment, or Sakai CLE, an open-source Learning Management System, for its online classroom. There are approximately 350 educational institutions around the world reportedly using Sakai CLE to support teaching, learning, research, and collaboration. PAD and Sakai CLE are APUS’s two core enterprise systems. 
APUS has several other systems that are used in the online campus, and to support the student experience, financial aid processing, financial management, human resources processes, marketing, and decision support. 
The backbone of APUS’s information technology infrastructure consists of two data centers: one in Virginia, and one at a co-location facility in Texas. APUS’s technology environment is managed internally. Student access to APUS’s systems is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers. 
Information technology systems are an essential part of the APUS student experience and our business operations, and we believe we will need to continue, and potentially increase, our investment of capital, time and resources, in technology operations and enhancements to support our systems and mission and evaluate when it is appropriate to make significant changes, modifications or upgrades. For example, we believe we will need to continue to make investments in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace, including increased demands for interactive solutions and access from multiple platforms, and to update older systems and to enhance functionality. For example, in 2010, we selected Sakai CLE to replace APUS’s existing provider as the foundational software for APUS’s online classroom, and in 2015 APUS selected Global Financial Aid Services for financial aid processing services, which required meaningful information technology changes. These types of changes are not without risk to our operations and financial results. We continually evaluate our PAD system for possible changes and upgrades, and such changes and upgrades may result in us incurring significant costs that could affect our financial results in the near term. Our investments in information technology systems may result in an increased level of spending, not all of which can be capitalized, and may cost more than expected or fail to be successful. Furthermore, as a result of unsuccessful development efforts, or a result of replacing outdated technology, software or other technology related assets, we may have assets that become impaired. For example, APUS reported a $4.0 million cost associated with the abandonment of development of a new student course registration system in the year ended December 31, 2016.
The performance and reliability of APUS’s networks and technology infrastructure, including those of third-party systems utilized by APUS, are critical to its reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure could interrupt APUS’s ability to operate and could result in the unavailability of its online classrooms, preventing students from accessing their courses and adversely affecting our results of operations. APUS’s technology infrastructure, and the technology infrastructure of its third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and hacker activities, terrorist activities, and telecommunications failures. APUS’s computer networks, and the networks of its third-party vendors, may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, and other security problems. APUS uses external vendors to perform its security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess its security. APUS utilizes this information to audit itself to ensure that it is adequately monitoring the security of its technology infrastructure. However, we cannot ensure that these security assessments and audits will protect APUS’s computer networks against the threat of security breaches. Similarly, although APUS requires its third-party vendors to maintain a level of security that is acceptable to us and works closely with its third-party vendors to address potential and actual security concerns and attacks, we cannot ensure that APUS and its systems and proprietary information or personal information about its students or employees will be protected against the threat of security attacks on third-party vendors that affect APUS systems or such information. System disruptions and security breaches of APUS’s online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or of the networks, infrastructures and systems of third parties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

Intellectual Property
APUS owns and exercises rights associated with patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. APUS owns all course syllabi and course and instructional materials developed by APUS faculty and employees and, as such, these course materials may be used by APUS in current and future courses as needed to facilitate instruction, and may be modified by APUS to meet evolving course or curriculum requirements. In general, APUS does not assert ownership claims to scholarly works of its faculty, such as articles and books, which were not developed as APUS course materials. Such intellectual property of APUS’s individual faculty members remains the property of each such faculty member and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it, unless the faculty member grants permission for use by others. APUS relies on agreements under which it obtains rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content providers. APUS does own the copyright for a work by a faculty member if APUS compensated the faculty member for the particular product or if APUS funded the research in whole or in part.
APUS has secured rights to trademarks for various names and terms used in its business, including “American Public University System,” “American Military University,” “American Public University” and logos incorporating the foregoing terms and acronyms of those terms, as well as “Ready When You Are,” “Educating Those Who Serve,” “RESPECTED. AFFORDABLE. ONLINE.,” “COMMITTED TO YOUR FUTURE,” “MASTERS OF DISASTER,” “MOMENTUM,” “MyMomentum” and the term “Partnership At a Distance.” These trademarks and brand names are central to a number of APUS’s marketing efforts and we believe they are important to how prospective students identify APUS. APUS also owns rights to more than 200 internet domain names pertaining to APEI, APUS, AMU, APU and other unique descriptors. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued APUS a patent for PAD in February 2011. 
Competition
Within the postsecondary education market, APUS competes primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. APUS also competes in specific targeted markets, such as those discussed below. For additional information regarding APUS’s competitive environment, please refer to “Business - Company Overview - Competition.” 
APUS has focused on serving the military community since its founding as AMU, and the military market continues to be the primary market for APUS. Within the military market, there are more than 2,700 institutions that serve military students and receive funds through the DoD tuition assistance program. The primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online instruction, and colleges and universities offering on-campus instruction located near military installations. Over the last several years, a number of APUS’s competitors have expanded their outreach and marketing efforts directed at active duty and reserve service members, as well as veterans. 
We believe that APUS will continue to see increased competition in the military community from both not-for-profit and for-profit schools. As traditional not-for-profit public and private schools advance their online capabilities, they will be able to more easily support the military community. At the same time, for-profit schools will market to students eligible for DoD tuition assistance programs and VA education benefits, rather than ED’s Title IV programs, in an attempt to comply with ED’s regulatory requirement known as the 90/10 Rule. This regulatory requirement is described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.”
Within the market for public safety professionals, such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders, and non-military professionals and other working adults with extended and irregular work schedules, APUS faces broad competition with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs.

Hondros College of Nursing
 HCN is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS. HCN’s programs are designed to prepare individuals for productive careers in the field of nursing. HCN’s students principally receive on-campus instruction at one of HCN’s Ohio campuses. In 2017, HCN had five campuses located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo. HCN opened the Toledo campus in January 2017. Additionally, HCN offers its RN-to-BSN Program and certain nursing courses online. As discussed more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations,” HCN participates in the Department of Education’s, or ED’s, Title IV programs pursuant to a Provisional Program Participation Agreement that was amended in December 2016 in response to ED’s decision to withdraw and terminate ED’s recognition of ACICS. HCN has an in process application for institutional accreditation by the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools, or ABHES, an accreditor for allied health schools that is recognized by ED. On February 6, 2018, ABHES notified HCN that at its January 2018 meeting, ABHES acted to defer action on HCN’s application for initial accreditation until ABHES’s May 2018 meeting. 
Curriculum and Scheduling
HCN offers on-campus instruction leading to a Diploma in Practical Nursing and an Associate Degree in Nursing. Graduates of the PN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a Licensed Practical Nurse, or LPN, after passing the NCLEX-PN exam. Graduates of the ADN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a Registered Nurse, or RN, after passing the NCLEX-RN exam. Through its RN-to-BSN Program, HCN also offers online instruction leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing to students who already possess an associate degree in nursing. HCN’s programs are offered in a quarterly format. Academic terms for the PN and ADN Programs begin four times each year, with courses starting in January, April, July and October. In an effort to better serve students and increase enrollments, HCN has increased its offering of evening and weekend courses. Approximately 53% of enrollments for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were in the PN Program, while 42% were in the ADN Program and 4% were in the RN-to-BSN Program.
Student Body and Enrollment
HCN provides nursing education to approximately 2,100 students at five campuses in Ohio, as well as online. The average HCN student is 30 years old and 92% of HCN students are female.
Accreditation
HCN is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS. By decision dated December 12, 2016, the Secretary of ED withdrew and terminated ED’s recognition of ACICS. When the Secretary withdraws the recognition of an accrediting agency, a postsecondary educational institution may be allowed to continue its participation in the Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the Secretary’s decision to allow the institution to seek accreditation from another recognized accrediting agency. ED has indicated that during the period of provisional participation it will deem an ACICS-accredited institution to hold recognized accreditation and will require the institution to comply with certain conditions and restrictions. On December 21, 2016, HCN and ED executed a revised provisional program participation agreement, or PPPA, and addendum to the PPPA in which HCN agreed to comply with ED’s conditions and requirements. HCN has an in process application for accreditation by ABHES. ABHES is a national accreditor for allied health schools recognized by ED. On February 6, 2018, ABHES notified HCN that at its January 2018 meeting, ABHES acted to defer action on HCN’s application for initial accreditation until ABHES’s May 2018 meeting. If HCN does not obtain accreditation from ABHES, or if ACICS does not receive new initial recognition from ED, by June 12, 2018, HCN will lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs. 
In June 2016, HCN was notified that its PN and ADN Programs were granted pre-accreditation candidacy status by the National League for Nursing Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation effective through June 23, 2019. The RN-to-BSN Program has received programmatic accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, or CCNE. The status and meaning of these accreditations and recognitions is described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.” 
Beginning in 2012, ACICS, HCN’s accreditor, established requirements, including minimum “standards” and expected “benchmarks,” to measure student retention, graduate placement and licensure exam passage rates. To satisfy ACICS’s standards, the retention rate, placement rate, and licensure exam pass rate each must exceed 60%. To satisfy ACICS’s benchmarks, each rate must exceed 70%. If ACICS determines that an institution’s campus-level or program-level data does not satisfy one or more standards or benchmarks, ACICS may take certain actions. In January 2017, ACICS published a new policy, effective December 6, 2016, that defines in terms of metric ranges when a particular action will be taken at the campus and 
17

program levels, including placement on reporting status, issuance of a compliance warning, issuance of a show-cause directive, or issuance of an adverse action. For the reporting year July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016, several HCN campuses and programs did not satisfy ACICS student achievement measures and as a result were placed on reporting status or were issued a compliance warning. HCN timely fulfilled all ACICS requirements with respect to those actions. On January 17, 2018, ACICS notified HCN that for the reporting year July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, three of its programs - the PN Program at the Cleveland campus, the PN Program at the Columbus campus, and the RN-to-BSN Program - did not satisfy ACICS student achievement benchmarks with respect to student retention rates. Each had a retention rate between 60 and 69.9%. ACICS placed these programs on reporting status and HCN is required to develop and implement an Improvement Plan that includes specific activities that are being implemented to improve student retention.
Student Recruitment and Marketing

HCN’s marketing strategy is focused on building long-term relationships with businesses, organizations and individuals in the healthcare community, primarily in Ohio. We believe this strategy will continue to generate a significant number of referrals. In addition, HCN utilizes traditional media as well as internet-focused marketing channels, including organic search, local display advertising and pay-per-click. However, if we are unable to effectively market HCN’s programs, we may not be able to successfully execute our long-term strategic plan to diversify our business and expand our programs, which would negatively affect our operating results. 
Student Admissions
HCN welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time by submitting an application along with an application fee. To be accepted into any HCN program, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, be at least 18 years old at the time of starting the program, and hold a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. HCN’s programs also have program-specific admissions requirements.
Applicants for both the PN Program and the ADN Program are required to complete an interview with an admissions representative, and complete and pass a criminal background check. PN Program applicants are also generally required to take and pass the Health Education Systems Admissions Assessment, or HESI Exam. 
ADN Program applicants who apply to start in the quarter immediately following their graduation from the PN Program may be admitted prior to possessing an active unencumbered PN license, but must obtain an active unencumbered PN license prior to the start of the their third quarter in the program. External applicants are required to have an active unencumbered PN license and to have graduated from an approved PN program.
RN-to-BSN Program applicants must hold an active, unencumbered registered nurse license in the state in which they desire to complete their practicum. Applicants must also have graduated from an approved registered nursing program with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0, and must complete an interview with an admissions representative. Applicants applying to begin the RN-to-BSN Program in the quarter immediately following graduation from the ADN Program may be admitted without a license, but are required to obtain one prior to their third quarter in the RN-to-BSN Program.
Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid
HCN’s tuition costs vary among its three programs. HCN’s PN Program may be completed for approximately $17,570 in tuition and fees, the ADN program may be completed for approximately $25,540 in tuition and fees, and the RN-to-BSN Program may be completed for approximately $20,880 in tuition and fees. Fees include the cost of examination review materials, lab fees, test review fees, and fees for applications with the Ohio Board of Nursing, among others. Some of these costs are payable to HCN and others are payable to third parties.
HCN’s students also incur costs for textbooks, supplies, uniforms and its technology package. These costs vary among HCN’s three programs and are paid for by HCN’s students as the textbooks or supplies are needed. HCN estimates that over the life of its programs a student’s costs related to textbooks and supplies will be approximately $3,600 for the PN Program, $5,500 for the ADN Program, and $4,400 for the RN-to-BSN Program. 
Sources of Student Financing
HCN’s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, VA education benefits, ED’s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most HCN students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. The substantial majority of HCN’s revenue is derived from 
18

students utilizing ED’s Title IV programs, which results in increased regulatory risks, as discussed more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The ‘90/10 Rule.’” As a result, HCN’s management may find it necessary to decrease HCN’s enrollment of students utilizing the Title IV programs or pursue other approaches, any of which could have a negative impact on its operating results and our financial condition. 
While HCN does not currently participate in DoD’s tuition assistance programs, it may do so in the future, in which case it will be subject to such program’s requirements and restrictions, which are more fully discussed in the “Our Institutions - American Public University System - Sources of Student Financing,” “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,” “Regulatory Environment - Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity - Federal Legislative Activity - Sequestration and Budgetary Matters,” and “Risk Factors” sections of this Annual Report.

Faculty and Staff
HCN’s faculty consists of approximately 145 faculty members with relevant teaching and nursing or healthcare practitioner experience. HCN also employs approximately 110 staff members who administer HCN’s academic, technology, service, and business operations. HCN’s faculty and staff largely work at one of its five campuses. None of HCN’s employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that HCN has a good relationship with its employees.
HCN has approximately 105 full-time faculty members with the remainder designated as part-time. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the PN Program must have earned the minimum of a bachelor’s degree in nursing. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the ADN Program and RN-to-BSN Program must have earned the minimum of a master’s degree. All HCN faculty whose instruction is nursing theory-based must have an active license to practice as a Registered Nurse. In addition to the formal education of HCN’s faculty members, many have also obtained specialized certifications in the field of nursing.
We believe that selecting well-educated and qualified faculty members is a key component to HCN’s success. In addition to having the necessary educational requirements, HCN seeks faculty members who have demonstrated experience in the field of nursing. Almost all faculty who teach HCN’s nursing courses have nursing experience in a clinical setting, which we believe helps teach HCN’s students the skills needed to be effective and safe caregivers. 
HCN trains and develops new faculty through a formal, structured on-boarding, training, and mentoring program. All new HCN faculty members receive a 90-day on-boarding experience, which includes a formal orientation to the organization, policies and procedures, teaching strategies, performance expectations and role responsibilities.  
Information Technology
In 2015, the hosting and maintenance of HCN’s information technology infrastructure was transitioned from a third-party affiliated with HCN’s previous ownership to APUS, which provides services through an intercompany arrangement. For information regarding the security and reliability of APUS provided systems please refer to “Our Institutions - American Public University System - Information Technology.”
Intellectual Property
In connection with our acquisition of HCN, we received the right to the corporate name National Education Seminars, Inc. and a royalty-free, irrevocable, exclusive, transferable, sublicensable license to use the names “Hondros College” and “Hondros College of Nursing” (or, instead of “Nursing,” any other qualifier directly related to nursing, medicine or healthcare in connection with the business and operations of HCN). 
HCN exercises rights associated with copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property.

Competition
HCN’s programs are largely offered as campus-based programs to residents in the geographic areas where it has campuses. In these regions, HCN competes with other schools offering nursing programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private colleges. Because of its geographic focus, HCN’s competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific not only to Ohio but also to the particular areas of Ohio where campuses are located, including in terms of the local supply of and demand for both nurses and for nursing schools. As a result of HCN’s geographic focus, HCN’s results are also more susceptible than an institution that draws from a broader geographical area to the actions of single competitors. For example, a particularly effective or ineffective marketing approach by another school, or the opening or closing of another school, could have unanticipated detriments or benefits to HCN’s competitive position. Because HCN’s RN-to-BSN Program is offered online, HCN also competes in a broader market against other online nursing programs. For additional information regarding HCN’s competitive environment, please refer to “Business - Company Overview - Competition.”

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
In the United States, postsecondary education institutions are overseen by a three-part regulatory framework comprised of (i) accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government through ED. Because APUS participates in military tuition assistance programs administered by the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, and APUS and HCN participate in veterans’ education benefits programs administered by the VA, our institutions are also subject to oversight by those agencies. The regulations, standards, and policies of these organizations cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and financial condition.
The postsecondary education regulatory environment is complex and continues to evolve. Applicable regulations, standards, and policies frequently change, and changes in, or new interpretations of existing regulations, standards, and policies, as well as applicable laws, could have material consequences for our institutions’ accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under federal student financial aid programs and military tuition assistance programs, and costs of doing business. In recent years ED has been actively issuing new rules that have had a substantial impact on the proprietary postsecondary education industry. For example, in 2010, ED adopted rules, which were generally effective July 1, 2011 and which we refer to as the Program Integrity Regulations, establishing significant new compliance requirements for institutions of higher education. In 2014, ED adopted rules, which were generally effective July 1, 2015 and which we refer to as the Final GE Regulations, defining the circumstances under which an education program prepares students for “gainful employment in a recognized occupation,” as is required in order for students enrolled in such programs to receive student financial aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA. In 2016, ED adopted rules, portions of which became effective July 1, 2017 and which we refer to as the Borrower Defense Regulations, establishing a new federal standard and process for determining whether a borrower has a defense to repayment on a loan, or a Direct Loan, made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, or Direct Loan Program, based on an act or omission of an institution; prohibiting institutions that participate in the Direct Loan program from using certain contractual provisions regarding dispute resolution, such as pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers, and requiring certain notifications and disclosures regarding the use of arbitration; and revising ED’s financial responsibility standards and adding related disclosure requirements. Certain portions of the Program Integrity Regulations, the Final GE Regulations, and the Borrower Defense Regulations, including delays to implementation of portions of the Final GE Regulations and the Borrower Defense Regulations, are discussed in this Annual Report.
The postsecondary education regulatory environment has changed and may change in the future as a result of the U.S. federal election in November 2016. For example, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, before the Borrower Defense Regulations took effect, ED, under new leadership, acted to postpone indefinitely certain portions of the Borrower Defense Regulations. ED subsequently delayed implementation of those rules until July 1, 2018 and announced its intent to further delay implementation of those rules until July 1, 2019. Similarly, in June 2017, ED announced that it will allow institutions until July 1, 2018 to comply with certain disclosure requirements in the Final GE Regulations. In the meantime, ED also has initiated new rulemaking processes to alter existing regulations, including the Borrower Defense Regulations and the Final GE Regulations, and could act to change other existing ED policies and practices with respect to matters related to postsecondary education institutions. In addition, on January 30, 2017, ED announced that it intends to take unspecified regulatory actions regarding certain regulations that have been published but have not yet taken effect, including regulations related to state authorization of distance education. As of February 2018, ED had taken no action with respect to the state authorization of distance education regulations. In December 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce considered and passed out of committee a draft of the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act, or PROSPER Act, to reauthorize the HEA. In its current form, the PROSPER Act would make dramatic changes to the HEA by, among other things, eliminating the 90/10 Rule discussed in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The ‘90/10 Rule.’,” eliminating regulation of gainful employment programs, and replacing current accountability metrics linked to cohort default rates with metrics linked to timely loan repayment. The U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has also held hearings related to HEA reauthorization, and the Chairman has issued a white paper including a number of policy proposals for consideration. We cannot predict the extent to which the Trump Administration and Congress will act to reauthorize the HEA or change or eliminate ED regulations, policies, and practices, nor can we predict the form that new legislation, regulations, policies, or practices may take.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a voluntary, non-governmental process through which an institution or a program submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution or program. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review 
21

evaluations of institutions or programs, and publicly recognize those institutions or programs that meet the stated criteria. Accredited schools and programs are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to ensure continued high performance, institutional and program improvement, and institutional and program integrity, and to confirm that accreditation criteria continue to be satisfied. An institution or program that is determined not to meet the criteria may have its accreditation limited, revoked, or not renewed.
Pursuant to provisions of the HEA, ED relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether the academic quality of an institution’s educational programs is sufficient to qualify the institution to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA, or Title IV programs. Institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education is also necessary to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. To be recognized by the Secretary of Education, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures for the review of educational institutions or programs. The loss of institutional accreditation would result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additional information about each of our institutions’ accreditation is provided above in each reporting segment’s “Our Institutions - Accreditation” section and as follows:

• | APUS is institutionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, a regional institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. In July 2011, HLC reaffirmed the accreditation status of APUS. In 2015, as required by HLC in connection with the 2011 reaffirmation of accreditation, APUS submitted an interim progress report that was subsequently accepted by HLC. HLC also from time to time may schedule site visits for other reasons, including an on-site visit related to a change of control, structure or organization transaction, a substantive change, or conformity with HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation (related to topics such as teaching and learning, and resources).


• | In connection with our organizational realignment, HLC requested that APUS submit an application to enable HLC to determine whether APUS’s proposal to enter into a shared services model with APEI constitutes a change in organization or structure that requires HLC prior approval. On December 22, 2016, APUS submitted the requested change of structure application. HLC is currently reviewing APUS’s application and as part of that review process conducted an on-site visit to APUS in early May 2017. On June 26, 2017 HLC notified APUS that HLC has delayed completing and issuing a report of its on-site visit because HLC staff believes that HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation and related policies do not provide an explicit frame of reference for how the Criteria for Accreditation should be applied to a shared-services model between an accredited institution and a related entity. On July 7, 2017, HLC notified APUS that at its June 29, 2017 meeting, the HLC Board of Trustees authorized the commencement of a process to develop a framework for applying the Criteria of Accreditation to such shared-services models through HLC’s Change of Control, Structure or Organization process. HLC indicated that members of the HLC Board of Trustees and HLC staff would present a proposed framework to the full HLC Board of Trustees for its consideration at its November 2017 meeting. HLC further indicated that APUS would have an opportunity to update its application after a framework was approved, and HLC staff would issue its report after reviewing any such updates. In November 2017, HLC notified APUS that the HLC Board of Trustees had adopted new guidelines for review of shared services arrangements, which were effective immediately, and invited APUS to submit updates to the application to reflect the new guidelines. APUS asked HLC staff to consider the change in structure application at the HLC Board June 2018 meeting, subject to submission of updates to the application. HLC had planned to visit APUS in February 2017 as part of a standard comprehensive evaluation. As a result of the change-of-structure application process, HLC agreed to postpone that comprehensive evaluation until the third quarter of 2018. We are unable to predict whether HLC will approve APUS’s application and whether or not such approval will be subject to limitations or conditions. Further, we are unable to predict what changes, if any, HLC may require to APUS’s organizational realignment and how such changes may impact our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for the 2020-2021 academic year.

On August 31, 2016, HLC adopted policy changes that are intended to facilitate quicker HLC responses to changing circumstances at accredited institutions. The policy changes permit HLC to designate publicly an institution as “in financial distress” or “under governmental investigation” where such situations have the potential to impact the institution’s operations and HLC believes the public should have information in making a decision to attend or continue to attend the institution. An accredited institution with a designation will be required to submit regular reports to HLC or undergo other special monitoring, and a substantive change application from an institution with a designation will be subject to strict scrutiny and may be deferred until the removal of the designation or may be denied. A designation typically will extend for not more than 
22

two years and may be removed when HLC determines the designation is no longer required because the institution has resolved the issues that led to the designation. On February 7, 2018, HLC notified APUS that it is imposing a “governmental investigation” designation on APUS in connection with the Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, issued to APUS on July 31, 2017 by the Attorney General of Massachusetts, which is discussed more fully below in this section in “Consumer Protection.” The designation is expected to remain in place until the office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts concludes its investigation, at which time HLC is expected to review the circumstances of the situation and determine what further action HLC will take, if any. In imposing the designation, HLC reached no conclusions about the merits of the investigation or its possible outcome. Imposition of the designation is accompanied by monitoring and a notice on HLC’s website that APUS is currently under governmental investigation. APUS must submit an interim report no later than June 4, 2018 providing an update regarding the status of the investigation. In its letter, HLC notified APUS that it will continue to review APUS’s change in structure application while the designation remains active; however, the HLC may determine to defer action on the application while the investigation is pending. The HLC Board of Trustees is tentatively scheduled to consider the application at its June 2018 meeting. HLC has indicated that it will review findings related to the designation, if any, when they occur and will determine whether such findings impact the change in structure application at that time. We cannot predict what actions HLC will take with respect to the designation, including with respect to APUS’s change in structure application. 
In July 2017, the Council on Education for Public Health, or CEPH, notified APUS that the CEPH Board of Councilors acted in June 2017 to accredit the Master of Public Health program for a five-year term, extending until July 1, 2022.

• | Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS, a national accrediting agency. After completion of our acquisition of HCN, ACICS acted to reinstate HCN’s accreditation through December 31, 2016, effective from the date of the acquisition. During the first quarter of 2016, ACICS conducted a site visit at each of HCN’s campuses as part of ACICS’ evaluation of HCN’s renewal of accreditation application. In 2016, ACICS reaffirmed HCN’s Cleveland campus’ accreditation through December 31, 2020, its Cincinnati and Dayton campuses’ accreditation through December 31, 2021 and its Columbus campus’ accreditation through December 31, 2022. ACICS also has granted accreditation to the new Toledo campus through April 30, 2018. ACICS conducted a site visit to the Toledo campus on January 31 - February 1, 2018. For more information, see “Regulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control” and “Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry.”

ACICS requires accredited institutions to submit annually certain campus-level and program-level data (e.g., retention rates, placement rates, and licensure exam pass rates) for purposes of monitoring student achievement against established requirements, including minimum “standards” and expected “benchmarks.” To satisfy ACICS’s “standards,” the retention rate, placement rate, and licensure exam pass rate each must exceed 60%. To satisfy ACICS “benchmarks,” each rate must exceed 70%. If ACICS determines that an institution’s campus-level or program-level data do not satisfy one or more standards or benchmarks, ACICS may take certain actions. In January 2017, ACICS published a new policy, effective December 6, 2016, that defines in terms of metric ranges when a particular action will be taken at the campus and program levels, including the issuance of a compliance warning, a show-cause directive, an adverse action or reporting with restrictions against a campus or program. 

For the reporting year July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016, several HCN campuses and programs did not satisfy ACICS student achievement measures and as a result were placed on reporting status or were issued a compliance warning. HCN timely fulfilled all ACICS requirements with respect to those actions. On January 17, 2018, ACICS notified HCN that for the reporting year July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, three of its programs - the PN Program at the Cleveland campus, the PN Program at the Columbus campus, and the RN-to-BSN Program - did not satisfy ACICS student achievement benchmarks with respect to student retention rates. Each had a retention rate between 60 and 69.9%. ACICS placed these programs on reporting status and HCN is required to develop and implement an Improvement Plan that includes specific activities that are being implemented to improve student retention. 
By decision dated December 12, 2016, the Secretary of ED withdrew and terminated ED’s recognition of ACICS, as discussed more fully below in this section. HCN has an in process application for accreditation by the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools, or ABHES, a national accreditor for allied health 
23

schools that is recognized by ED for federal student financial aid purposes. On February 6, 2018, ABHES notified HCN that at its January 2018 meeting, ABHES acted to defer action on HCN’s application for initial accreditation until ABHES’s May 2018 meeting. 
Institutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Students, corporations, and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards, and employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate’s credentials. 
The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, or NACIQI, is charged with advising the Secretary of Education on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for federal purposes, including for participation in Title IV programs. NACIQI is composed of 18 members with six-year membership terms, with members appointed equally and at staggered intervals by the Secretary of ED, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. 
In June 2015, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew HLC’s recognition as an accrediting agency through December 2017. ED subsequently accepted NACIQI’s recommendation and scheduled HLC for consideration during NACIQI’s February 2018 meeting. If HLC were to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency, APUS could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs.
In June 2016, NACIQI recommended that ED’s Senior Department Official deny ACICS’s petition for renewal of recognition and withdraw ACICS’s status as a recognized accreditor. On September 22, 2016, the ED Senior Department Official concurred with NACIQI’s recommendation and terminated ED’s recognition of ACICS as a nationally recognized accrediting agency. ACICS appealed the decision to the Secretary of ED, who by decision dated December 12, 2016 withdrew and terminated ED’s recognition of ACICS. When the Secretary withdraws the recognition of an accrediting agency, a postsecondary educational institution may be allowed to continue its participation in the Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the Secretary’s decision to allow the institution to seek accreditation from another recognized accrediting agency. In connection with ACICS’s loss of recognition, ED has indicated that during the period of provisional participation it will deem an ACICS-accredited institution to hold recognized accreditation and will require the institution to comply with certain conditions. 
ED will also impose certain additional requirements on ACICS-accredited institutions that do not meet certain milestones toward accreditation by another recognized accrediting agency. On December 21, 2016, HCN and ED executed a revised provisional program participation agreement, or PPPA, and addendum to the PPPA in which HCN agreed to comply with ED’s conditions and requirements. HCN has an in process application for accreditation by ABHES, an accreditor for allied health schools that is recognized by ED. On February 6, 2018, ABHES notified HCN that at its January 2018 meeting, ABHES acted to defer action on HCN’s application for initial accreditation until ABHES’s May 2018 meeting.
On December 15, 2016, ACICS filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against ED in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. ACICS asked the court to stay the Secretary’s decision terminating ACICS’s recognition status, restore ACICS’s recognition status, and enjoin ED from enforcing the requirements for ACICS-accredited institutions, including those set forth in ED’s provisional program participation agreement. On December 20, 2016, the court denied ACICS’s request for a temporary restraining order, and on February 21, 2017, the court denied ACICS’s request for a preliminary injunction. 
 On March 31, 2017, ACICS filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to vacate the Secretary’s decision terminating ACICS’s recognition status and requesting that the court return ACICS’s petition for continued recognition to ED for reconsideration. On April 28, 2017, ED filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Briefing on the motions was completed as of May 26, 2017, and the court may schedule a hearing to assist in its consideration of the motions. If the court does not restore ACICS’s recognition status, HCN would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs beyond June 12, 2018, unless HCN becomes accredited by another accrediting agency recognized by ED within that period. In addition, the approval status and in some cases funding provided by other agencies could be adversely affected by HCN’s loss of accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency, even during any period of ED’s provisional certification of HCN. For additional information regarding the risks associated with loss of accreditation please refer to the “Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry” section of this Annual Report. On October 4, 2017, ACICS announced that it had submitted to ED a formal petition for recognition as a national accreditor. ED subsequently scheduled ACICS’s petition for consideration during NACIQI’s May 2018 meeting.
In addition to institutional accreditation, our institutions have obtained specialized accreditation or professional recognition for several specific programs, as described more fully above in each reporting segment’s section entitled “Our 
24

Institutions - Accreditation.” Accreditation of a program by a specialized accrediting agency or granting of professional recognition by a professional organization signifies that the program meets the standards of that agency or organization. If one of our institutions fails to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies and professional organizations, the institution could lose the specialized accreditation or professional recognition for the relevant programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs, prevent the institution from offering the programs in certain states, or prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their desired fields or employment from particular employers.
State Licensure/Authorization
Our institutions are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which they are authorized to operate. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state, and state regulations change frequently. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states may also prescribe regulations related to an institution’s financial condition, and some states require the posting of surety bonds. State laws and regulations may also affect our institutions’ ability to offer educational programs, open locations, and award degrees. If one of our institutions fails to comply with a state’s regulatory requirements, it may lose state licensure or authorization, which would result in the institution’s inability to enroll students in that state, and could result in the institution’s inability to receive Title IV program funds and DoD tuition assistance funds, at least for students in that state.
Some states assert authority to regulate an institution if its educational programs are offered to residents of those states, regardless of whether the institution maintains a physical presence in the state where the student resides. The increased popularity of online education has led and may further lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations in various states. States may also revise their regulations in this area as a result of recent ED regulations, as discussed more fully below in “State Licensure/Authorization Requirements.” New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business. For additional information regarding the risks related to the regulation of the internet, please refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.”
Changes in our business or changes in the nature or amount of our contact with or presence within a particular state could lead states that do not currently require our institutions to be licensed or authorized to require such licensure or authorization in the future. For example, programs that include “on the ground” components that may be described as instructional activities, such as clinical internships, may be viewed by some state regulatory agencies as constituting a physical presence for regulatory purposes. As those programs expand, it is possible that our institutions will need to seek formal authorization to operate in some states where historically they have not been required to do so. The extent of this expansion in regulatory requirements, and the associated costs and significance, are not known at this time. Furthermore, there may be some states where it takes a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative, or where we are not able to do so at all.
The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, is a voluntary agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a national council and administered by four regional education compacts, which accept applications from states in their regions to join SARA. SARA requires states to approve institutions in their state to participate in SARA, based upon institutional accreditation and financial stability, and to resolve student complaints. SARA membership is open to degree-granting postsecondary institutions from all sectors, including public colleges and universities as well as not-for-profit and for-profit independent institutions. An institution must be accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. SARA member states agree to impose no additional (non-SARA) authorization requirements to provide distance education on institutions from other SARA states. For SARA purposes, an institution’s “home state” is the state where its main campus or central unit holds its principal legal domicile. SARA shifts principal oversight responsibilities from the state in which the distance education is being received to the “home state” of the institution offering the instruction. SARA does not cover, or limits its coverage related to, certain activities in which an institution may engage in a state, meaning if the institution engages in that activity in a state, it may still be required to obtain state authorization in that state even if it is a SARA member, including for example, authorization from agencies or boards responsible for professional requirements. Membership in SARA was opened to states in January 2014. The State of West Virginia joined SARA effective December 1, 2014. APUS’s initial application to become a SARA institution was approved on December 8, 2014, and APUS has been a participating SARA institution since that time. The State of Ohio joined SARA effective March 2, 2015. HCN’s initial 
25

application to become a SARA institution was approved in April 2016, and HCN has been a participating institution since that time. Applications must be renewed annually. 
Many states also have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in a specified field. Students often seek to obtain professional licensure in their chosen fields after graduation. Their success in obtaining licensure typically depends on several factors, including, for example: the individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and the accreditation of the institution and the specific program. SARA has no effect on state professional licensure requirements. 
State Licensure/Authorization Requirements
“Home” State Authorization
The final Program Integrity Regulations adopted by ED address certain institutional and program eligibility issues, including state authorization. The Program Integrity Regulations specify how an institution may demonstrate that it is authorized to offer postsecondary educational programs by the state(s) where it is located, which we refer to as its “home” state. If requested by ED, an institution must be able to document its home state’s approval in order to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, the home state must have a process to review and take appropriate action on complaints concerning postsecondary institutions. ED has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, these requirements. If ED determines that an institution does not have the required state approval, the institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs. After ED stayed implementation of the home state authorization rules from July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2015, the rules were implemented effective July 1, 2015. We cannot predict the extent to which ED will determine that the institutional authorization or complaint review process of any state satisfies ED’s regulations. If APUS were to lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs because it failed to obtain authorization by the state in which it is located or because a state’s institutional authorization and complaint process did not satisfy ED’s requirements, it would also lose its ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. The loss of ability of one of our institutions to participate in either Title IV programs or DoD tuition assistance programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
State Authorization of Online Education
In November 2013, ED announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking panel to consider regulations for, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education. Negotiated rulemaking sessions occurred in the winter and spring of 2014, but the negotiating committee did not reach consensus. ED published final regulations on December 19, 2016, and they are scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2018. On January 30, 2017, ED announced that it intends to take unspecified regulatory actions regarding the final regulations. As of February 2018, ED has taken no action with respect to the state authorization of distance education regulations.
The final regulations require an institution offering distance education programs to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students. An institution could obtain such authorization directly from the state or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement that satisfies ED’s definition of such an agreement. Under the final rule, for states that do not participate in SARA, our institutions will be required to obtain any required state authorization from those states in order to offer distance education programs to students who reside in those states and to award federal student financial aid to those students. For states that do participate in SARA, if ED deems SARA not to satisfy ED’s definition of a state authorization reciprocity agreement, our institutions would be required to seek any required authorization from those states as well in order to offer distance education programs to students who reside in those states and to award federal student financial aid to those students, which would increase our regulatory burdens and costs.
The final regulations also require an institution to document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education for each state in which such students reside. In addition, the final regulations require an institution to provide public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs that are provided or can be completed solely through distance education or correspondence courses, excluding internships and practicums. The public disclosures would include state authorization for the program, the process for submitting complaints to relevant states, any adverse actions by a state or accrediting agency related to the distance education program within the past five years, refund policies, and applicable licensure or certification requirements for a career a student prepares to enter and the program’s sufficiency to meet those requirements. An institution would be required to disclose directly and individually to all prospective students when a distance education program does not meet the licensure or certification requirements for the state in which the student resides. An institution would be required to disclose to each enrolled and 
26

prospective student when an adverse action is taken against the program by a state agency or accrediting agency and any determination that a program ceases to meet licensure or certification requirements.
State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions
APUS is physically headquartered in West Virginia, with administrative offices in Virginia. At present, APUS enrolls students from each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia. APUS is currently authorized to offer its programs by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, or WVHEPC, the regulatory agency governing postsecondary education in West Virginia. We believe that under current law the only state authorization or licensure necessary for APUS to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs is its authorization from WVHEPC. We believe the same is true under current law for Title IV programs. As described above under “State Authorization of Online Education,” ED published final rules regarding state authorization of distance education for Title IV purposes, and those rules are effective July 1, 2018. Failure to comply with the requirements of WVHEPC could result in APUS losing its authorization from WVHEPC, its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which could force APUS to cease operations.
Due to APUS having administrative offices located in Virginia, under Virginia law APUS is also required to be authorized by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, or SCHEV. Accordingly, APUS has obtained SCHEV’s authorization to operate as an out-of-state institution in Virginia.
Since December 2014, APUS has been a participating institution in SARA, which is described more fully above. APUS is licensed in West Virginia by WVHEPC and in Virginia by SCHEV because of its operations in those states. In addition, APUS is authorized through reciprocity in the other 46 SARA-member states and the District of Columbia. APUS has also obtained licensure or authorization to operate or conduct activities in the two states (i.e., California and Massachusetts) that have not joined SARA. 
HCN is physically headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, and has five campuses in Ohio. HCN is currently authorized to offer its programs by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, the regulatory agency responsible for authorizing for-profit and not-for-profit private career schools offering associate degree, certificate, and diploma programs in Ohio. HCN’s Practical Nursing Diploma and Associate Degree in Nursing programs are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing, or OBN. The OBN conducted a routine site visit regarding the PN Program from July 24 to July 25, 2017. On August 9, 2017, the OBN notified HCN that it did not make any adverse findings as a result of the visit. HCN’s online completion program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing is approved by the Ohio Department of Higher Education, the regulatory agency in Ohio responsible for authorizing education programs at the bachelor’s degree level and above. As of April 2016, HCN is a participating SARA institution.
To apply for licensure to practice nursing in Ohio, an applicant must have successfully completed a nursing education program that is approved by the OBN. Regulations of the OBN require that nursing education programs such as HCN’s PN and ADN Programs have a pass rate on the relevant National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX, that is at least 95% of the national average for first-time candidates in a calendar year. If a program does not attain this pass rate, the program may face various consequences. On March 8, 2017, OBN placed HCN’s ADN Program on provisional approval because the ADN Program had not met the OBN pass rate standard for four consecutive years. The OBN will consider restoring a program to Full Approval status after a program is placed on provisional status due to low NCLEX scores if the program attains a pass rate that meets or exceeds 95% of the national average for first-time candidates for at least two consecutive years. If a program on provisional approval fails to meet and maintain the requirements of the OBN at the end of the time period established for provisional approval, the OBN may propose to continue provisional approval for a set time period or may propose to withdraw approval pursuant to an adjudication proceeding. At this time, the OBN has not released a final report of the ADN Program’s performance for calendar year 2017, but preliminary data suggests that HCN’s ADN Program did not meet the OBN pass rate standard in 2017. HCN has been implementing changes, including the curriculum changes discussed in this Annual Report, that are designed to improve NCLEX scores over time but there is no assurance that these changes will be successful. This situation could have an adverse impact on our ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue HCN’s ADN Program, any of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
Failure to comply with state authorization or licensure requirements could restrict our institutions’ ability to recruit or enroll students in certain states or result in other sanctions being imposed on our institutions, including fines and penalties. In some cases, regulatory agencies responsible for state authorization or licensure may impose limitations on certain activities and may impose particular requirements with respect to certain programs. We review the licensure requirements of states to determine whether our institutions’ activities in those states may constitute a physical presence or otherwise may require authorization or licensure by the respective state education agencies. We cannot predict the extent to which states will retain 
27

membership in SARA, the manner in which SARA’s rules applicable to member states and rules applicable to participating institutions may be modified, interpreted and enforced, including in response to regulation by ED, our institutions’ ability to comply with SARA’s requirements and retain membership eligibility, or the impact that failure to meet the SARA requirements may have on our business. To date, state-specific limitations and requirements have not had a material effect on our institutions’ operations. However, new laws, regulations, interpretations, or changed circumstances related to our institutions’ educational programs could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students and offer programs in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements
Our students finance their education through a combination of Title IV programs administered by ED, the DoD tuition assistance programs, education benefits administered by the VA, private loans, corporate reimbursement programs, and individual resources. Participation in federal student aid programs, including those administered by DoD and VA, adds to the regulation of our operations. In particular, the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny in the form of numerous standards we must satisfy in order to participate in and administer Title IV programs.
Department of Education
The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through Title IV programs, in the form of grants and loans to eligible students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by ED to participate in Title IV programs, provided the student’s program satisfies Title IV program eligibility requirements. An institution may participate in Title IV programs only if it is certified to do so and it enters into a written program participation agreement, or PPA, with the Secretary of Education. The PPA conditions initial and continued participation in Title IV programs upon compliance with ED regulations, including regulations applicable to individual Title IV programs, and any additional conditions specified in the PPA.
Types of Title IV Financial Aid Programs.
Title IV program aid is primarily awarded to students on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending an institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost. All recipients of Title IV program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts and in a timely manner to eligible students.
Students at our institutions receive grants and loans to fund their education under several Title IV programs, of which the two largest are Direct Loans and Pell Grants. Students at our institutions are eligible to participate in the following Title IV programs:
(1) Federal Student and Parent Loans. ED’s most significant form of aid includes loans to students and their parents through the Direct Loan Program. Direct Loan Program loans are made directly by the federal government to students or their parents. The Direct Loan Program offers Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans. 
Federal Stafford Loans, or Stafford Loans, may either be subsidized or unsubsidized. A student with demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive a subsidized Stafford Loan where ED pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in school and during the first six months after leaving school. A student without demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive an unsubsidized Stafford Loan where the student is responsible for the interest that accrued while in school and after leaving school. Students who are eligible for a subsidized Stafford Loan may also be eligible to receive an unsubsidized Stafford Loan. Federal Parent PLUS Loans, or Parent PLUS Loans, may be obtained by the parents of a dependent undergraduate student in an amount not to exceed the difference between the total cost of that student’s education (including allowable expenses) and other aid to which that student is entitled. Students who are classified as independent, and dependent students whose parents are unable to obtain Parent PLUS Loans, can receive additional unsubsidized Stafford Loans. Federal Grad PLUS Loans, or Grad PLUS Loans, are available to graduate or professional students enrolled at least half-time. The obligation to begin repaying federal loans does not commence until six months after a student ceases enrollment as at least a half-time student. Federal Consolidation Loans allow a student who has graduated, left school, or dropped below half-time enrollment to combine multiple federal education loans into one loan with one interest rate and one monthly payment.
28

(2) Federal Grant Programs. Pell Grants are ED’s primary program for grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount of availability of a Pell Grant was $5,815 for the 2016-2017 award year and $5,920 for the 2017-2018 award year, and will be $5,920 for the 2018-2019 award year. A student’s lifetime eligibility to receive a Pell Grant is 12 semesters (or its equivalent). Students may not be able to use all of this eligibility at our institutions based on their prior receipt of Pell Grants from other institutions prior to enrolling in one of our institutions.
Beginning July 1, 2017, in accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2017, institutions that participate in the Title IV programs may award Pell Grant funds for up to 150% of a student’s standard scheduled Pell Grant in one award year. This provision, which commonly is referred to as “year-round Pell,” is intended to allow students to graduate more quickly and with less debt. To be eligible for the additional Pell Grant funds, a student must be otherwise eligible to receive Pell Grant funds and must be enrolled at least half-time in the payment period for which the student receives additional Pell Grant funds in excess of 100% of the student’s standard scheduled award.
The Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, or FSEOG, program provides grant awards designed to supplement Pell Grants for the neediest undergraduate students. The availability of FSEOG awards is limited by the amount of those funds allocated by ED to an institution under a formula that takes into account the size of the institution, its costs, and the income levels of students. 
The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant, or TEACH Grant, program provides grant assistance to undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate students who agree to serve for at least four years as full-time “highly qualified” teachers in high-need fields in public or not-for-profit private elementary or secondary schools that serve students from low-income families. Due to sequestration, the maximum award for any TEACH Grant first disbursed on or after October 1, 2017 and before October 1, 2018 was reduced to $3,736 from an earlier maximum of $4,000.
(3) Federal Work-Study. Under the Federal Work-Study program, ED pays a share, generally 75%, of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students, based on their financial need, to perform work for the institutions they attend, or for off-campus public or not-for-profit organizations.
Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs
To be eligible and certified to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Secretary of Education, must be authorized to operate by the appropriate regulatory authority in each state where the institution maintains a physical presence, and must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED.
ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions with Title IV program requirements. As a result, our institutions are subject to extensive oversight and review. For all these reasons, we cannot predict with certainty how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. See “Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity” below for more information. Key provisions relating to institutional participation in Title IV and the processing of Title IV aid that could adversely affect us include the following:
Eligibility and Certification Procedures. An institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.
ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if ED finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all Title IV requirements and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is initially certified or undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control. During a period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its PPPA. In addition, ED may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its PPPA, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds.
29

APUS is fully certified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2020. HCN was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control in November 2013, requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. As described more fully below in “Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control,” in January 2016 we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control and granting HCN provisional certification to participate in the Title IV programs. HCN received a fully executed provisional program participation agreement in February 2016. HCN must comply with specific conditions while it is provisionally certified, as described more fully in “Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs,” below. In addition, as described above in “Accreditation,” in connection with the Secretary of ED’s decision to withdraw and terminate ED’s recognition of ACICS, on December 21, 2016, HCN and ED executed a revised PPPA and addendum to the PPPA in which HCN agreed to comply with additional conditions and requirements. Under the PPPA and addendum, HCN may continue to participate in the Title IV programs on a provisional basis until June 12, 2018 while HCN seeks accreditation by another recognized accrediting agency. 
State Authorization. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies. As described more fully above in “State Licensure/Authorization,” ED has specified the types of state approvals that are acceptable to demonstrate that an institution is authorized to offer educational programs beyond the secondary level by the state where it is located, and ED recently promulgated new rules, effective July 1, 2018, that address authorization by states in which students enrolled in distance education programs reside.
Administrative Capability. Current ED regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things:

• | comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations;


• | have capable and sufficient personnel to administer Title IV programs;


• | have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;


• | not have cohort default rates above specified levels;


• | have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;


• | not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;


• | provide financial aid counseling to its students;


• | refer to ED’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;


• | submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations;


• | report annually to the Secretary of Education on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders to any employee who is employed in the institution’s financial aid office, or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans;


• | develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepant information with respect to a student’s application for Title IV aid; and


• | not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.

If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, ED may require the repayment of federal student financial aid funds, transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment of Title IV program funds to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.
Financial Responsibility. The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to ED for debts and liabilities incurred in programs administered by ED.
ED evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards. The financial responsibility standards include a complex formula that uses line items from the institution’s audited financial statements. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s profitability or ability to operate within its means). Generally, an institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible 
30

without the need for further federal oversight. Under certain circumstances, an institution may be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis.
ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to an eligible institution’s parent ownership entities. At the request of ED, for purposes of evaluating the financial responsibility of our institutions, including the composite score calculation, we supply consolidated financial statements to ED.
The Borrower Defense Regulations, among other things, modify ED’s financial responsibility standards to provide that an institution (other than a public institution) may not be able to meet its financial or administrative obligations, and is therefore not financially responsible, if it is subject to one or more triggering events that occur on or after July 1, 2017. On June 16, 2017, ED published a notice in the Federal Register to announce that in light of the existence and potential consequences of pending litigation that had been brought in federal court to challenge the Borrower Defense Regulations, ED decided to postpone indefinitely the implementation of certain provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations, including provisions that would have revised ED’s financial responsibility standards and added related disclosure requirements. Also on June 16, 2017, ED announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Borrower Defense Regulations and to address certain other related matters. On July 6, 2017, the attorneys general of 18 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against ED to challenge the legal authority for ED’s delay of the Borrower Defense Regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of that litigation, the extent to which a revised rule may differ from the previously promulgated Borrower Defense Regulations, or the impact that such a revised rule might have on our business. On August 30, 2017, ED announced that as part of the negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Borrower Defense Regulations it would form a subcommittee to focus on potential modifications to ED’s financial responsibility regulations. On October 24, 2017, ED published an interim final rule in the Federal Register to delay until July 1, 2018 the effective date of the provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations identified in the June 16, 2017 notice. ED stated that delay to a specific date, namely July 1, 2018 or July 1 of a later year, is required in order to comply with the Higher Education Act’s master calendar requirements for rulemaking. On October 24, 2017, ED also published a notice in the Federal Register announcing ED’s intent to delay beyond July 1, 2018 to July 1, 2019 the effective date of the provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations identified in the June 16, 2017 notice, because ED determined it would not be practicable to engage in negotiated rulemaking and publish final regulations before July 1, 2018. The negotiated rulemaking committee held meetings in November 2017, January 2018, and February 2018 but the members of the committee did not reach consensus on proposed regulatory language. As a result, ED may propose regulatory language, including regulations to modify ED’s financial responsibility standards, with no obligation to use language negotiated or agreed upon during the committee meetings. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted. 
Failure of one of our institutions to meet the “financial responsibility” requirements, because it does not meet the minimum composite score to establish financial responsibility or is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, or because it fails to meet other financial responsibility requirements, could cause the institution to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation. Because ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to an eligible institution’s ownership entities, ED’s determination that our Consolidated Financial Statements do not satisfy the “financial responsibility” requirements could cause both APUS and HCN to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation.
The “90/10 Rule.” A requirement of the HEA, commonly referred to as the “90/10 Rule,” applies only to “proprietary institutions of higher education,” which includes for-profit schools like our institutions. Under this rule, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving from Title IV programs, on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) for any fiscal year, more than 90% of its revenue (as computed for 90/10 Rule purposes). If an institution violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year, the institution is placed on provisional status for two fiscal years. An institution that violates the rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and is required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two additional fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. ED discloses on its website any proprietary institution of higher education that fails to meet the 90/10 requirement, and reports annually to Congress the relevant ratios for each proprietary institution of higher education.
Using the applicable 90/10 formula, the following table contains the percentage of cash-basis revenue earned from Title IV program funds:
31


 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017
APUS | 45% | 43% | 41% 
HCN | 86% | 84% | 83% 

We continue to monitor compliance with the 90/10 Rule.
The 90/10 Rule has been a subject of interest over the past several Congresses, which has resulted in several members of Congress introducing proposals and legislation that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One previous Congressional proposal would have decreased the limit on Title IV funds from 90% to 85% and would have counted DoD tuition assistance and GI Bill education benefits toward that limit. In contrast, the PROSPER Act, which has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives for purposes of reauthorizing the HEA, would eliminate the 90/10 Rule. At this time we cannot predict whether or how the recent change in Administration and Congress will affect proposals to modify the 90/10 rule. Such proposals, or other similar legislation, should they become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions.
Incentive Payment Rule. As part of an institution’s Title IV program participation agreement with ED and in accordance with the HEA, an institution may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or federal student financial aid. Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in termination of participation in Title IV programs, limitation on participation in Title IV programs, or financial penalties. 
On June 2, 2015, ED released a memorandum regarding enforcement of the prohibition on the payment of incentive compensation by postsecondary institutions to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admissions activities, or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance based directly or indirectly upon success in securing enrollments or financial aid. The memorandum indicated that ED will revise its approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the prohibition against incentive compensation. In administrative enforcement actions, ED will calculate the amount of the institutional liability based on the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive compensation prohibition. ED may also impose a fine upon an institution, or take administrative action to limit, suspend, revoke, deny, or terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, if the institution violates the prohibition. We are currently unable to predict the impact that ED’s revised approach to measuring damages under the incentive compensation prohibition might have on our financial condition if one of our institutions is found to be in violation of the prohibition.
We believe that our employee compensation and third-party contractual arrangements comply with the incentive payment rule currently in effect. However, certain ambiguities in the final rule, ED’s accompanying statements in the rule release, and guidance issued by ED in March 2011 and June 2015, create uncertainty as to how the revised rule will be interpreted and enforced by ED. In light of these uncertainties, or otherwise, we can make no assurances that ED would not find deficiencies in our past, current, or future employee compensation plans and relevant third-party contractual arrangements.
In addition, in recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as “qui tam” cases, brought pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that an institution’s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management’s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.
Gainful Employment. Under the HEA, as amended, proprietary schools are generally eligible to participate in Title IV programs only in respect of educational programs that prepare students for “gainful employment in a recognized occupation.” Historically, this concept has not been defined in detailed regulations. The Program Integrity Regulations address certain institutional and program eligibility issues, including gainful employment. Under the Program Integrity Regulations, all institutions must use a template designed by ED to disclose to prospective students, with respect to each gainful employment program, occupations that the program prepares students to enter, total cost of the program, on-time graduation rate, job placement rate, if applicable, and the median loan debt of program completers for the most recently completed award year. The Program Integrity Regulations included additional rules pertinent to gainful employment programs. A federal court struck down these additional rules and left the disclosure requirements in place.
On October 31, 2014, ED published the Final GE Regulations, which relate to gainful employment. On July 1, 2015, the Final GE Regulations went into effect, with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which went into effect January 1, 2017. The ED template to be used in connection with the new disclosure requirements was released January 19, 2017, and 
32

institutions were required to provide updated disclosures using the template no later than July 1, 2017. On January 19, 2018, ED released the most recent version of the disclosure template, which institutions must adopt on or before April 6, 2018. Unlike the previous version, the new template does not require institutions to disclose median earnings data or room and board charges.
The Final GE Regulations establish debt-related measures for determining whether certain postsecondary education programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Final GE Regulations set forth two debt-to-earnings measures: an annual earnings rate and a discretionary income rate, which we refer to collectively as the D/E rates. A program will pass the measures if the program’s graduates have annual loan payments:

• | less than or equal to 8% of their total earnings; or


• | less than or equal to 20% of their discretionary income.

A program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings measures, and that has an annual earnings rate that is greater than 8% and less than or equal to 12% or a discretionary income rate that is greater than 20% and less than or equal to 30%, will be in a warning “zone.” A program fails the measures if its annual earnings rate is greater than 12% (or the denominator of the annual earnings rate is zero) and its discretionary income rate is greater than 30% (or the income for the denominator of the discretionary earnings rate is negative or zero).
Pursuant to the Final GE Regulations, and subject to the potential for adjustments based on a transition period, a program will become ineligible for Title IV funding if it fails both debt-to-earnings measures twice in three consecutive years, or if the program is in the warning “zone” for four consecutive years. An institution will be required to provide warnings to students, including prospective students, when notified by ED that a program could become ineligible based on its final debt-to-earnings measures for the next award year.
ED may be delaying release of 2016 numbers until after 2015 alternate earnings appeals are adjudicated, neg reg is completed, or indefinitely. According to ED’s final 2015 D/E rates, which were released in January 2017, none of the APUS gainful employment programs were identified as failing or in the warning “zone.” ED’s D/E rates include no calculations of regular or transitional D/E rates for approximately three quarters (76 out of 100) of APUS’s gainful employment programs because of the size of those programs. Specifically, under ED’s gainful employment rules, ED does not calculate regular D/E rates for gainful employment programs with fewer than 30 students who received Title IV program aid in the cohort, after making certain adjustments, and ED does not calculate transitional D/E rates for gainful employment programs with fewer than 10 students who received Title IV program aid in the cohort, after making certain adjustments. For purposes of applying the gainful employment accountability measures, if a gainful employment program’s D/E rates are not calculated or issued for an award year, the program receives no result under the D/E rates measure for that award year and the program’s status under the D/E rates measure is unchanged from the last year for which D/E rates were calculated, provided that if ED does not calculate D/E rates for the program for four or more consecutive years, ED will disregard the program’s D/E rates for any award year prior to the four-year period when determining whether the program is eligible for Title IV funds. Notwithstanding the low tuition rates charged by APUS, we are unable to reliably and accurately predict how the gainful employment programs for which ED did not calculate 2015 D/E rates may perform under the accountability measures in the future, including because certain underlying data required to calculate the D/E rates are not available to us. 
With respect to HCN, according to ED’s final 2015 D/E rates, none of the HCN gainful employment programs were identified as failing or in the warning “zone.” The PN and ADN Programs each pass the D/E rates measure. The Associate Degree in Nursing program passed because it had a discretionary income rate less than or equal to 20%, although its annual earnings rate was not less than or equal to 8%. ED’s D/E rates include no calculations of regular or transitional D/E rates for the HCN online RN-to-BSN Program because of the size of that program. We are unable to reliably and accurately predict how the RN-to-BSN Program may perform under the accountability measures in the future, including because certain underlying data required to calculate the D/E rates are not available to us. 
For the APUS and HCN programs for which we do have D/E rates, there is no assurance that the rates in the future will remain the same and how our gainful employment programs will perform under ED’s accountability measures. ED has not released 2016 debt-to-earnings measures, and it is unclear when ED intends to do so.
In addition to the debt-to-earnings measures, the Final GE Regulations include new requirements related to gainful employment programs. For example, the Final GE Regulations require an institution’s most senior executive officer to certify, as part of the program participation agreement, that each eligible gainful employment program offered by the institution satisfies certain requirements related to institutional and programmatic accreditation and professional licensure or certification exam requirements. Also, the Final GE Regulations expand upon the existing gainful employment program disclosure requirements. On June 30, 2017, ED announced that it will allow institutions until July 1, 2018 to comply with certain 
33

disclosure requirements in the Final GE Regulations, including requirements to include a link to the disclosure template in promotional materials and to distribute directly a copy of the disclosure template to prospective students. The June 30, 2017 announcement did not change the July 1, 2017 deadline for the requirement to provide a completed disclosure template, or a link thereto, on GE program web pages, and the Final GE Regulations as a whole have not been delayed or altered. Accordingly, pending additional guidance or instruction from ED, APUS and HCN must continue to comply with the requirements of the Final GE Regulations that have not been delayed. A failure to comply with the Final GE Regulations could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
On June 16, 2017, ED announced that it would convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Final GE Regulations. ED held two public hearings and solicited written comment from the public with respect to the agenda for the negotiated rulemaking committee, which met for the first time in December 2017. We submitted written comments on the agenda for the negotiated rulemaking committee on July 12, 2017. The negotiated rulemaking committee held meetings in December 2017 and February 2018 and is scheduled to meet again in March 2018. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted. 
Student Loan Defaults. Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program loans by its students exceed certain levels.
Pursuant to the Higher Education Opportunity Act enacted in 2008, or the HEOA, which amended the HEA, an institution’s cohort default rate, or three-year cohort default rate, is calculated as the percentage of borrowers in the cohort who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. ED calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program loan during that year. Pursuant to ED requirements, if the three-year cohort default rate for any year after 2011 exceeds 40%, an institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, and if the institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for three consecutive years, beginning with the 2009 cohort, the institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If an institution’s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% in any year after 2011, it must establish a default prevention task force.
In September 2017, ED released APUS’s and HCN’s official three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2014. The final official ED cohort default rate for the federal fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014 are as follows:

 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 
APUS | 23.3% | 20.1% | 23.6%
HCN | 11.8% | 11.4% | 11.4%

If one or both of our institutions has a default rate in excess of allowable levels, it could result in that institution’s or those institutions’ loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or incurring additional costs related to default prevention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Privacy of Student Personal Information and Records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, and ED’s regulations implementing FERPA require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students’ educational records by limiting an institution’s disclosure of a student’s personally identifiable information without the student’s prior written consent. FERPA also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution, to notify students at least annually of their rights under FERPA, and to maintain records in each student’s file listing certain requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, a federal law designed to protect consumers’ personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. GLBA and the applicable GLBA regulations require an institution, to among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents, or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective 
34

actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. Institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use and disclosure of student information. Institutions must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a section of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts. Our collection of personal information relating to students or other individuals who are in the European Union, or EU, such as applications, may implicate EU data privacy law. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which replaces the current 1995 European Data Protection Directive, becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR continues, expands upon, and adds obligations that organizations must follow with respect to the collection, possession, use and disclosure of personal information relating to individuals in the EU. The GDPR requirements are generally stricter and more comprehensive than those of the U.S. As the GDPR has not yet come into effect, enforcement priorities and interpretation of certain provisions remain unclear. However, non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine for certain activities of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of an organization’s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, per violation.
Accessibility for Students with Disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or Section 504, prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance, which includes us. In 2010, ED’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice, asserted that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, ED’s Office for Civil Rights has taken enforcement action against several institutions of higher education, including primarily online institutions, after investigating their websites and online learning management platforms and determining that the institutions were not in compliance with Section 504 because the online resources were not accessible to persons with a disability. If one of our institutions is found to have violated Section 504, it may be required to modify existing content and functionality of its online classroom or other uses of technology, including through adoption of specific technical standards. An institution that does not come into compliance with Section 504 could lose access to federal funding, including the ability to participate in the Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs. 
College Affordability and Transparency Lists. As required by the HEOA, ED publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of nine categories, with (i) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (ii) the highest “net price” for the most recent academic year, (iii) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (iv) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to ED explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. ED reports annually to Congress on these institutions and publishes its reports on its website. ED also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. Under the HEOA, net price means average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted. For 2015-2016, the most recent data available, APUS was listed as the institution with the twenty-first lowest tuition and fourteenth lowest net price among private for-profit, four-year or more institutions. We cannot predict with certainty the effect such lists will have on our operations.
College Scorecard. President Obama directed ED to develop and publish a new college ratings system by the 2015-2016 school year. On December 19, 2014, ED issued a framework for the college ratings system. On June 25, 2015, ED stated that in lieu of creating its previously announced college ratings system, it would instead create a consumer-driven website that will allow users to compare colleges based on measures that may be of importance to them. In September 2015, ED publicly released its “College Scorecard” website. Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. However, we do not believe the College Scorecard’s method for calculating graduation rates appropriately indicates APUS’s graduation rate because the College Scorecard’s graduation rate includes only the performance of first time, full-time undergraduate students, who represent less than approximately 1% of all APUS students. Furthermore, substantially all of the other College Scorecard measures are based on data collected only about students who receive Title IV program aid. While a significant portion of APUS students receive Title IV program aid, in total they are a minority of APUS’s students. We cannot predict the extent to which the College Scorecard may impact our institution’s enrollments, reputation, or operating results. In October 2017, ED announced that its Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, or IPEDS, would publish for the first time completion data for part-time and non-first-time students, which will provide additional information about institutions’ performance.
Third-Party Servicers. ED regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution’s participation in Title IV programs. Our institutions utilize a third-party servicer to provide services related to the disbursement of Title IV financial aid credit balance refunds. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the 
35

Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to ED new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. If any third-party servicer engaged by one of our institutions does not comply with applicable statute and regulations including the HEA, our institution may be liable for its actions, and our institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. 
Title IV Return of Funds. Under ED’s return of funds regulations, when a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned funds to ED in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of Title IV program funds that a student “earned” before withdrawal. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV program funds or (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institution’s determination that a student withdrew.
If funds are not timely returned, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under ED regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution’s annual compliance audit constitute material noncompliance for which an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit. HCN’s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2012 identified a deficiency related to timely return of Title IV program funds. In a Preliminary Audit Determination Letter dated July 10, 2013, ED requested additional information from HCN about the situation and required HCN to conduct a file review to identify those files that reflected an inaccurate refund. In a Final Audit Determination Letter dated February 28, 2014, ED determined that HCN was not required to repay the liability to ED and directed HCN to adopt procedures to prevent reoccurrence. HCN was also required to post an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $128,290, which was released by ED in February 2018.
APUS’s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2016 identified a finding related to return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly computed. In a Final Audit Determination letter dated January 29, 2018, ED conveyed its finding that funds had not been returned timely. Under ED regulations, if the institution’s annual Title IV compliance audit for either of its two most recently completed fiscal years finds that Title IV funds were not returned timely for 5% or more of students sampled in the audit, the institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit. ED also noted that a similar finding had been made in an open program review with respect to which APUS has not yet received a program review report. In connection with the finding, ED indicated that APUS must post an irrevocable letter of credit equal to 25% of the total amount of Title IV program funds that should have been returned during calendar year 2016, which results in a requirement for a letter of credit of approximately $700,000. On February 15, 2018, APUS requested that ED reconsider its finding that APUS had made untimely returns.
Misrepresentation. Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, ED may fine, suspend or terminate the participation in Title IV programs by an institution that engages in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. In the future, ED could promulgate regulations that expand its role in monitoring and enforcing prohibitions on misrepresentation. For information regarding an ED finding of substantial misrepresentation at HCN based on circumstances that occurred prior to our acquisition of HCN, see “Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control.”
Credit Hours. The HEA and current regulations use the term “credit hour” to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV program funds an institution may disburse during a payment period. The Program Integrity Regulations define the previously undefined term “credit hour” in terms of a certain amount of time in class and outside class, or an equivalent amount of work. The Program Integrity Regulations also require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution’s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution’s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of ED. If ED determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, ED could require the institution to repay any incorrectly awarded amounts of Title IV program funds. In addition, if ED determines that an institution has significantly overstated the amount of credit hours assigned to a program, it may fine the institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in Title IV programs.
VAWA and Clery. On April 1, 2014, a negotiated rulemaking committee, convened by ED, reached consensus on proposed regulations to address implementation of the changes made by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, or VAWA, to section 485(f) of the HEA, otherwise known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and 
36

Campus Crime Statistics Act, or the Clery Act. On October 20, 2014, ED promulgated final regulations to implement changes made by VAWA, the Final VAWA Regulations. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to ED and disclose in its annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred on or within the institution’s so-called “Clery geography.” Under the Final VAWA Regulations, an institution must report and disclose statistics about, for example, crimes of “dating violence,” “domestic violence,” and “stalking,” as newly defined by the Final VAWA Regulations. Also, under the Final VAWA Regulations, an institution’s annual security report must include certain statements about what an institution will do to assist persons who allege that they have been a victim of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. In addition, an institution must publish in its annual security report procedures for institutional disciplinary action in such cases. APUS historically has not had to comply with the Clery Act because it is a wholly online institution. As a result of opening a Veteran’s Center in Charles Town, WV, APUS determined that it is no longer subject to that exclusion and issued its first annual security report in 2016. HCN publishes an annual security report as required by the Clery Act. The Final VAWA Regulations require institutions to provide “primary prevention programs” for incoming students and new employees and “ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns” for students and employees, and to describe these programs and campaigns in their annual security report. A failure to comply with the Final VAWA Regulations could result in our institutions being fined or having their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Borrower Defenses. Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. ED’s existing regulations permit a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. For Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, the Borrower Defense Regulations would create a new federal standard for borrower defenses to repayment of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. On June 16, 2017, ED published a notice in the Federal Register to announce that in light of the existence and potential consequences of pending litigation that had been brought in federal court to challenge the Borrower Defense Regulations, ED decided to postpone indefinitely the implementation of certain provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations, including those portions of the regulations that would have established a new federal standard and a process for determining whether a Direct Loan borrower has a defense to repayment on a Direct Loan based on an act or omission of an institution. Also on June 16, 2017, ED announced that it would convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Borrower Defense Regulations and to address certain other related matters. See “Regulatory Environment - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Financial Responsibility” for further discussion of the rulemaking process to date with respect to the Borrower Defense Regulations. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted. In the meantime, ED’s existing regulations related to borrower defense claims remain in effect. If ED determines that borrowers of Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loans, our repayment liability to ED could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
Cash Management Regulations: On October 27, 2015, ED announced the publication of final regulations to amend ED’s cash management regulations, which we refer to as the Cash Management Regulations. The Cash Management Regulations were effective July 1, 2016. Among other topics, the Cash Management Regulations address arrangements between postsecondary institutions and financial account providers to disburse Title IV Program credit balances to students, including through the use of debit or prepaid cards. The Cash Management Regulations require institutions to establish a process to facilitate student choice in how students receive Title IV Program federal student financial aid credit balances; limit the personally identifiable information about students that may be shared with financial account providers; and require institutions to obtain student consent before opening an account in the student’s name. Under the Cash Management Regulations, an institution that has entered into an arrangement with a financial account provider must mitigate certain fees incurred by Title IV aid recipients, and certain types of fees are prohibited. The Cash Management Regulations require that contracts governing arrangements with financial account providers be publicly disclosed and evaluated in light of the best financial interests of students. The Cash Management Regulations also make other changes to requirements for the institutional administration of Title IV Programs, including by clarifying how previously passed coursework is treated for Title IV eligibility purposes, altering the requirements for converting clock hours to credit hours, and updating other provisions in ED’s cash management regulations. For example, the Cash Management Regulations establish a requirement that institutions participating in the Title IV Programs under the reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring payment methods must pay any credit balance due to a student before seeking reimbursement or a request for funds. The Cash Management Regulations also specify the circumstances under which an institution may include the cost of books and supplies as part of institutional tuition and fees charged to a student, such as if the institution has made arrangements with publishers to obtain books at below-market rates or if books or electronic course materials are not available elsewhere. The Cash Management Regulations also expand the group of students to whom an institution must provide a way to obtain or purchase, by the seventh day of a payment period, the books and supplies applicable to the payment period. Previously, an institution was required to provide such assistance only to students who receive Pell Grants, but under the Cash Management Regulations, an institution will be required to provide such assistance to 
37

any student who is eligible for Title IV Program aid. Our institutions utilize a third-party servicer to provide services related to the disbursement of Title IV financial aid credit balance refunds. 
Department of Defense
Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the DoD, or DoD tuition assistance programs. Service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary of Education. For students in APUS undergraduate programs, we have established tuition rates per credit hour that under current DoD policies can be 100% covered by DoD tuition assistance funds provided that the student does not exceed the annual limits per student. At this time, HCN has submitted an application to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. Under a DoD final rule effective January 7, 2013, each institution participating in DoD tuition assistance programs is required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to being permitted to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs. In May 2014, DoD promulgated new regulations and a revised MOU, the 2014 MOU. On July 7, 2014, DoD released revisions to the 2014 MOU, and APUS signed the revised 2014 MOU in August 2014. The 2014 MOU contains requirements and limitations that were not contained in previous MOUs to which APUS was a party. Pursuant to the 2014 MOU, among other requirements, institutions must: explain certain ED and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, tools to service members, such as ED’s “College Navigator” website and the CFPB’s “Paying for College” website; comply with requirements related to readmission policies for service members; abide by new limitations on the use of funds derived from tuition assistance; provide additional academic and student support services; disclose information about transfer of credit; in certain circumstances, return tuition assistance funds to DoD (such as when a student ceases to attend or an institution cancels a course); offer to service members loan counseling before private student loans are offered or recommended; and comply with ED’s Title IV “program integrity” rules, including rules related to incentive payments and misrepresentation. The 2014 MOU also provides that an institution may only participate in DoD tuition assistance programs if it is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, approved for VA funding, and a participant in Title IV programs. Additional information regarding the potential risks associated with the 2014 MOU is provided in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
On March 14, 2013, DoD issued an instruction restricting the ability of service members in certain duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive DoD tuition assistance for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have contracts with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin a postsecondary education program after arrival in an applicable overseas duty location may not use DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education in our programs until after they have already successfully completed a course with an institution that has entered into a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas duty location may continue to receive DoD tuition assistance for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that have entered into contracts with the DoD to provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location.
On January 30, 2014, the DoD, VA, ED, and FTC, in collaboration with the CFPB and Department of Justice, announced a new online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 GI Bill, DoD tuition assistance programs, and other military-related education benefit programs. The complaint system is designed to help the government identify and address unfair, deceptive, and misleading practices. The complaint system is based on President Obama’s April 27, 2012 Executive Order 13607, or EO 13607, which requires federal agencies to create a centralized complaint system for students receiving federal military and veterans educational benefits to register complaints that can be tracked and responded to by relevant agencies. An institution having recurring substantive complaints, or demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve complaints, may face a range of penalties, including revocation of its MOU and removal from participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs.

The VA administers education benefits provided by federal law, including the Montgomery GI Bill, or GI Bill, and the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, or Post-9/11 GI Bill. Pursuant to federal law related to those programs, APUS is approved to provide education to veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in West Virginia and Virginia. Programs at each of HCN’s campuses are approved for VA benefits by the state approving agency in Ohio.
38

The Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty since September 11, 2001, including reservists and members of the National Guard, as well as benefits available under the GI Bill. The Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded the ability of service members to transfer their benefits to family members. The Post-9/11 GI Bill also provides veterans up to $1,000 per academic year for books, supplies, equipment, and other education costs. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, or Improvements Act, revised the calculations of benefits related to tuition and fees under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. For a veteran attending a non-public U.S. institution, the Improvements Act provides tuition and fees based on the net cost to the veteran (after accounting for state and federal student financial aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance), up to $22,805.34 for the academic year from August 1, 2017 - July 31, 2018. Veterans pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance equal to 50% of the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents, or $840.50 per month.
On August 16, 2017, the President signed into law the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, commonly known as the Forever GI Bill. The law makes several changes to the administration of VA education benefits. Among other things, for service members who left the military after January 1, 2013, the bill removes a requirement that they use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits within 15 years after their last 90-day period of active-duty service. The bill also alters the way the VA calculates eligibility for VA education benefits by providing additional benefits to service members with at least 90 days but less than six months of active-duty service. Additionally, the bill will restore VA education benefits to students who were enrolled in schools that closed after January 2015 if their credits did not transfer. 
To the extent that DoD tuition assistance programs do not cover the full cost of tuition for service members, eligible service members may also use their benefits under the GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill through the “Top-Up” program. The “Top-Up” program allows U.S. Military active-duty service members to use their GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of DoD tuition assistance that is paid by the military for the course, but is limited to 36 months of payments.
Additional Sources of Student Payments
In addition to the Title IV, DoD, and VA programs described above, eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources. Some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Our institutions may offer interest free payment plans of less than 12 months to students to assist them with the financing of educational expenses. Our institutions enter into agreements with various employers who provide employee tuition reimbursement plans. Through these agreements our institutions agree to a variety of terms, including terms related to the provision of tuition grants to eligible employees. In certain circumstances, our students may access alternative loan programs from private lenders. Alternative loans from private lenders are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and the student’s total cost of attendance. Students can apply to a number of different private lenders for this funding. As part of an institution’s Title IV PPA, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans, including alternative loans.
Consumer Protection
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The CFPB has pursued enforcement actions against certain for-profit institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. In October 2017, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released its annual report analyzing more than 7,700 complaints from private student loan borrowers and more than 12,900 federal student loan servicing complaints the CFPB received between September 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017. We do not know what enforcement actions the CFPB may pursue, or what steps Congress or federal agencies may take, in response to these reports and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
In July 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin stating that any entity subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction, whether a third-party collector or a creditor collecting its own debts, can be held accountable for any unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in collecting a consumer’s debts. In November 2013, the CFPB issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing that it was considering whether rules governing the collection of debts are warranted under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, or other CFPB authorities, and, if so, what types of rules would be appropriate. As part of its proposed rulemaking, the CFPB sought comments about applying a regulatory regime similar to the FDCPA, which applies only to third-
39

party debt collectors, to first-party debt collectors. Should the CFPB issue rules regulating first-party debt collectors such rules might apply to our institutions, which may adversely impact our collections efforts. 
In August 2015, the CFPB issued a CID to ACICS, the accrediting agency that accredits HCN. The CID required ACICS to provide documents and testimony, to identify all schools it has accredited since January 1, 2010, and to identify the individuals involved in ACICS’s reviews of certain schools, not publicly identified. In September 2015, ACICS submitted a petition to the CFPB to set aside the CID, arguing that ACICS is not under the CFPB’s jurisdiction. ACICS argued that it does not provide any financial product or service nor does it assist or support its accredited institutions in procuring and maintaining loans from ED. In October 2015, the CFPB rejected ACICS’s petition and filed a petition to enforce the CID in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In April 2016, the District Court denied the CFPB’s petition and dismissed the case. The CFPB appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which on April 21, 2017 affirmed the denial of the CFPB’s petition to enforce the CID. 
Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints
Concurrent with release of the Final GE Regulations, ED announced the formation of an interagency task force to help ensure oversight of for-profit higher education institutions. The task force includes ED, the Departments of Justice, Treasury, VA, the CFPB, the FTC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. State attorneys general also have been invited to participate. The purpose of the task force is to coordinate the agencies’ activities and promote information sharing to protect students from unfair, deceptive, and abusive policies and practices. ED explained that the task force, which had its first official meeting in May 2015, is expected to build on existing efforts among various federal agencies.
Many states have become more active in regulating proprietary education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically related to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. For example, a group of state attorneys general, led by the Attorney General of Kentucky, are examining the for-profit education industry. The Kentucky Attorney General’s website reports that approximately 30 state attorneys general are participating. In January 2014, many of the publicly traded for-profit postsecondary institutions, not including us, received demands for information from a network of 12 state Attorneys General relating to, among other matters, the recruitment of students, admissions standards, graduate placement statistics, graduate certification and licensing results, and student lending activities. In June 2014, the Attorney General of Massachusetts released several consumer protection regulations, which, among other things, require certain disclosures that apply to for-profit and occupational schools operating in the state. Actions by state attorneys general and other governmental agencies, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions’ programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.
On August 3, 2017, we received from the Attorney General of Massachusetts a CID, dated July 31, 2017, relating to an investigation of alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by AMU in connection with the recruitment and retention of students and the financing of education. The CID requires the production of documents and information relating to recruitment, enrollment, job placement and other matters. We continue to cooperate with the Attorney General’s office and cannot predict the eventual scope, duration, or outcome of the investigation at this time. At the conclusion of the investigation, we may be subject to claims of failure to comply with Massachusetts state law or regulations and may be required to pay significant financial penalties and/or modify or curtail our operations and/or our reputation and relationship with our current and prospective students could be harmed. Other state attorneys general may also initiate inquiries into APEI or its subsidiaries. Based on information available to us at present, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential impact this inquiry might have on our financial conditions or results of operations, if any, because it is uncertain what remedies the Attorney General might ultimately seek in connection with the inquiry, if any. As discussed more fully above in this section in “Accreditation,” on February 7, 2018, HLC notified APUS that it is imposing a “governmental investigation” designation on APUS in connection with the CID. 
Our institutions are recipients of complaints filed with state regulatory authorities, the Better Business Bureau, and posted in online forums. Our institutions attempt to resolve such complaints in a cooperative manner. However, even if such complaints are resolved or are otherwise unfounded they may still harm the reputation of our institutions. For example, in August 2017, HCN received notice from the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools that the Ohio State Board was initiating formal disciplinary action against HCN’s Cincinnati campus because the campus discontinued offering one version of the PN Program curriculum allegedly without the Ohio State Board’s permission and implemented a new PN Program curriculum. It was alleged that at least three students enrolled in the discontinued curriculum were unable to complete without transferring into the new program and incurring substantial costs and time to complete the program. As permitted, on August 10, 2017, HCN requested a hearing before the Ohio State Board with respect to the notification and HCN is cooperating with the Ohio State Board on the matter. Simultaneously, HCN submitted a proposed resolution to the Ohio State Board, which 
40

included for each of the three students a partial refund for classes in which they enrolled but earned no credit. The Ohio State Board accepted HCN’s proposal. One student accepted the proposal, and the two others failed to return executed agreements to the Ohio State Board by their due dates. As a result, HCN is no longer obligated to make partial refunds to those two students, and on January 8, 2018, the Ohio State Board informed those two students that it had closed their cases.
Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations
Compliance Reviews 
Our institutions are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, agencies that guarantee FFEL Program loans, DoD, VA, and accrediting agencies. The HEA and ED regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable ED Office of Inspector General audit standards. For fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, our institutions must submit such audits that have been conducted in accordance with the guide for audits of proprietary schools that was issued by the ED OIG in September 2016. In addition, to enable the Secretary of Education to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations.
In September 2016, ED began a program review of APUS’s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years. As part of the program review, ED conducted a site visit from September 12 to September 15, 2016. In general, after ED conducts its site visit and reviews data supplied by the institution, if ED identifies any instances of noncompliance, ED sends the institution a preliminary program review report. The institution has the opportunity to respond to the findings in the preliminary program review report. ED then issues a final program review determination letter, which identifies any findings, including any liabilities. The institution may appeal any monetary liabilities specified in the final program review determination letter. If ED does not identify any instances of noncompliance, it issues an expedited final program determination letter instead of a preliminary program review report. APUS has not received a preliminary program review report or expedited final program determination letter, and the program review remains open and ongoing. We anticipate that certain findings addressed in the 2016 Title IV compliance audit Final Audit Determination letter dated January 29, 2018 will be resolved through the program review process, including a finding that return of Title IV funds calculations were incorrectly computed for some students and a finding that APUS had incorrectly reported the students’ enrollment status to the National Student Loan Data System for some students. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the program review, when it will be completed, or whether ED will place any liability or other limitations on APUS as a result of the review.
In order to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs, institutions must, among other things, comply with a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, that specifies terms and conditions of participation in DoD tuition assistance programs. By signing the MOU, APUS agreed to participate in DoD’s Third Party Education Assessment. The DoD MOU requires institutions to participate in the DoD Third Party Assessment to ensure that the institution is in compliance with the DoD MOU and that service members are provided quality voluntary education opportunities that meet their needs. A third party assessment of American Military University was conducted in June 2012 with a revised report submitted in October 2012. The report stated that, based on the assessment team’s findings, AMU and APUS were in compliance with the DoD MOU that APUS executed.
In January 2017, DoD announced that its Third Party Education Assessment will take the form of a new Voluntary Education Institutional Compliance Program, or ICP, which replaces the former process, the Military Voluntary Education Review. The ICP utilizes a sampling approach to regularly review the 2,700 educational institutions that participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs. Each year, DoD selects randomly 200 institutions and uses a risk-based model to select 50 additional institutions. The risk-based model takes into account several data elements, including: rate of course completion; total verified complaints; changes in enrollment of students receiving tuition assistance; ratio of graduation rate relative to cost per course; changes in graduation rate; and total number of enrollment transactions processed. The ICP is an iterative process with three stages. After each stage, DoD narrows the list of institutions subject for heightened review in the following stage. DoD shares the findings from each stage with other government agencies and regulators. An institution that is selected and has no issues will be exempt from random selection for three years and from risk-based selection for one year. By signing the MOU, APUS also agreed to participate in the ICP when requested. APUS was notified on May 8, 2017 that it was included in the first set of 250 institutions selected to participate in the ICP. On May 29, 2017, APUS submitted a self-assessment as part of the first stage of the ICP. On February 9, 2018, DoD issued an Iteration 1 Report for APUS that made two findings. With respect to recruiting, marketing, and advertising, DoD found some instances where attire worn by an individual providing testimonials on the institution’s public-facing website could be construed as similar to a distinctive part of military uniform. With respect to financial matters, DoD found a lack of information relating to the financial aid process, including the lack of a timeline for applying for financial aid. APUS must develop a corrective action plan to address each of the findings within 30 
41

days after receipt of the Iteration 1 Report and must resolve the findings and provide information to DoD about corrective actions taken within six months after receipt of the Iteration 1 Report. If the resolution cannot be completed within six months, APUS must submit a status report every three months until the finding is resolved. An educational institution that demonstrates an unwillingness to resolve a finding may be subject to a range of penalties from a written warning to revocation of the MOU and termination of the institution’s participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs. If we are no longer able to receive funds from DoD tuition assistance programs, or if those programs are reduced, eliminated, or temporarily suspended, our enrollments and revenue could be significantly reduced, which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations
If our institutions fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, ED could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring our institutions to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV program funds, requiring the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of ED as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against our institutions, referring the matter for criminal prosecution, or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate participation in Title IV programs. If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against our institutions and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of participation in Title IV programs, our institution’s enrollments, revenue, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If APUS’s approval to participate in Title IV programs is terminated, APUS will also lose its ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs pursuant to the DoD MOU, which would materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.
If one of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds were reduced, we could seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our institutions, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. We may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.
In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our institutions’ participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public.
Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations
Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are also subject to regulation from a variety of agencies. ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to acquire or sell institutions, and to establish additional locations and programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. HLC, WVHEPC, SCHEV, ACICS, the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, and the Ohio Department of Higher Education generally require institutions to notify them, and sometimes require institutions to obtain their approval, in advance of opening a new location or implementing new programs.
Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control
ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements and accreditation standards may limit our ability to acquire, merge, or sell institutions, and may impose restrictions on activities following a transaction. These restrictions may impede our ability to grow by acquisition, or to dispose of assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
A change in control could occur as a result of future transactions in which we are involved, such as corporate reorganizations or changes in the Board of Directors. Moreover, as a publicly traded company, the potential adverse effects of a change in control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control could discourage bids for our shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.

U.S. Department of Education
The HEA provides that an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility. ED’s regulations provide that a change in control of a publicly traded company occurs in one of two ways: (i) if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing a change in control; or (ii) if the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock, or ceases to be the largest stockholder. As a result, a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, including an acquisition resulting in a stockholder owning at least 25% of our outstanding stock, could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control pursuant to ED’s regulations.
Upon a change in ownership and control, an institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period prior to recertification. The HEA provides that ED may temporarily provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership and control based on preliminary review of a materially complete application received within 10 business days after the transaction. ED may continue such temporary provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution’s application. If ED determines to approve the application after a change in ownership and control, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. ED’s regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change in ownership and control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution’s parent corporation.
When a change in ownership and control occurs, ED applies certain financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership. The institution’s same-day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least 1:1, which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities (and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables). The same-day balance sheet must demonstrate positive tangible net worth. In addition, when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner, the institution must submit to ED audited financial statements of the institution’s new owner’s two most recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with ED requirements. ED may determine whether the financial statements meet financial responsibility standards with respect to the composite score formula. If the institution does not satisfy these requirements, ED may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution’s agreement to letters of credit, provisional certification, and additional monitoring requirements. The composite score formula and related ED conditions are described more fully above in “Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Financial Responsibility.” If the new owner does not have the required audited financial statements, ED may impose certain restrictions on the institution, including with respect to adding locations and programs.
On November 1, 2013, as a result of our purchase of all of the outstanding stock in National Education Seminars, Inc., HCN was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. As required under ED’s regulations, we timely submitted a change in ownership application and required documentation. As part of ED’s post-closing review, in May and December 2014 ED requested additional information related to a putative class action brought against HCN by two former HCN students that was settled in exchange for a de minimis settlement payment, with HCN admitting to no wrongdoing; we provided the requested information to ED shortly after it was requested. On December 4, 2015, ED sent HCN a letter informing HCN that ED had determined to fine HCN $27,500. The fine was based on ED’s review of the submitted information and a finding that HCN had substantially misrepresented its programmatic accreditation status during a time period prior to our ownership of HCN. On December 18, 2015, HCN responded to ED in a letter in which it noted its disagreement with ED’s findings but informed ED of its decision to pay the fine in order to promptly resolve the matter and to enable ED to finalize its review of the application for a change in ownership. HCN paid the fine in December 2015.
In January 2016, we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control of HCN and granting HCN provisional certification to participate in Title IV programs. HCN received a fully executed provisional program participation agreement, or PPPA, in February 2016. HCN must comply with specific conditions while it is provisionally certified, as described more fully in “Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs,” below. As described in “Regulatory Environment -Accreditation,” in connection with ED’s decision to terminate recognition of ACICS, on December 21, 2016, HCN and ED executed a revised PPPA and addendum to the PPPA pursuant to which HCN agreed to comply with certain conditions and requirements while HCN pursues accreditation by another accrediting agency recognized by ED. Under 
43

the revised PPPA and addendum, HCN may continue to participate in the Title IV programs on a provisional basis until June 12, 2018 while it seeks accreditation by another recognized accrediting agency.
State Regulatory Agencies
Many states require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among state regulatory agencies. Many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval. A change in control under the definitions of a state agency that regulates us may require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our state approval. Under certain circumstances, WVHEPC and the SCHEV may require us to seek approval of changes in ownership and control in order to maintain APUS’s state authorization or licensure.
We were required to seek, and we obtained, approval from the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools and the Ohio Department of Higher Education for the change in ownership and control of HCN. In the future, if we attempt to acquire other institutions, the states regulating the target institutions may require us to seek approval, which may or may not be granted.
Accreditors
Many accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval for certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary.
HLC, the accrediting agency for APUS, requires HLC accredited institutions to inform HLC in advance of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to HLC include changes in the legal status, ownership, or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a for-profit institution. HLC must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution’s accreditation status. HLC also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval.
HLC oversight extends to defined changes that occur in an institution’s parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock could trigger additional reviews of the institution and possible change from accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks associated with these types of actions. In particular, a change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution’s ability to participate in Title IV programs, which in turn would impact the institution’s ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs.
ACICS, the accrediting agency for HCN, requires ACICS-accredited institutions to inform ACICS in advance of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to ACICS include changes in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution. An institution must notify ACICS of a change of ownership at least 15 days before consummating the proposed change, and ACICS must act to reinstate the institution’s accreditation status after the change of ownership. ACICS also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval. HCN timely notified ACICS of the November 1, 2013 change of ownership, and on December 20, 2013, ACICS granted to HCN a reinstatement of accreditation through December 31, 2016, effective from the date of the change. ACICS conducted on-site quality assurance visits in the summer of 2014 and found HCN to be in compliance with accreditation criteria. During the first quarter of 2016, ACICS conducted a site visit at each of HCN’s campuses as part of ACICS’ evaluation of HCN’s renewal of accreditation application. In 2016, ACICS reaffirmed HCN’s Cleveland campus accreditation through December 31, 2020, its Cincinnati and Dayton campuses’ accreditation through December 31, 2021 and its Columbus campus accreditation through December 31, 2022. ACICS also has granted accreditation to the new Toledo campus through April 30, 2018. ACICS conducted a site visit to the Toledo campus on January 31 - February 1, 2018. See “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation” for a discussion of the decision by ED to terminate the recognition of ACICS as a recognized accrediting agency. 
Should we attempt to enter into transactions with institutions accredited by other accreditors, we would be required to follow the requirements of such accreditors. Our management may not have experience with the accreditors of the target institution, which would increase the risks related to such a transaction and management of the institution subsequent to the transaction.
Other Agencies
44

Pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists, APUS is approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserves and their dependents by the state approving agencies in West Virginia and Virginia. Programs at each of HCN’s campuses are approved for VA benefits by the state approving agency in Ohio. In certain circumstances, state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control. The state approving agency in Ohio approved the November 1, 2013 change of ownership of HCN. However, there is no guarantee that relevant state approving agencies will approve future transactions.
Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs
ED may, as a condition of certification to participate in Title IV programs, require prior approval of new campus locations, programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. ED’s regulations also require that it approve any change in ownership resulting in a change of control. As described above in “Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control,” HCN was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control on November 1, 2013 requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. In January 2016, we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control of HCN and granting HCN provisional certification to participate in the Title IV programs. HCN received a fully executed Provisional Program Participation Agreement, or PPPA, in February 2016. While provisionally certified, HCN operates under the PPPA, which requires HCN to apply for and receive approval from the Secretary of Education before initiating any substantial changes, such as establishing an additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered and Title IV program funds will be disbursed, offering academic programs at higher than the bachelor’s degree level, or adding a new education program. In addition, as described above in “Accreditation,” in connection with the Secretary of ED’s decision to withdraw and terminate ED’s recognition of ACICS, on December 21, 2016, HCN and ED executed a revised PPPA and addendum to the PPPA in which HCN agreed to comply with additional conditions and requirements, and under which ED has said that it will approve the addition of locations or educational programs only in limited circumstances. 
The HEA requires proprietary institutions of higher education to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, the applicable regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional campus locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. The new campus location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval of the additional campus location by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution’s accrediting agency. ED’s regulations also require institutions to report and, in certain cases (such as when an institution is provisionally certified), to seek approval for a new additional campus location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions. Under the PPPA and the addendum to the PPPA, HCN must obtain ED approval for the addition of any location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered and Title IV program funds will be disbursed.
A fully certified degree-granting institution generally is not obligated to obtain ED’s approval of an additional program leading to a degree at the same level previously approved by ED. Similarly, a fully certified institution generally is not required to obtain advance approval for a new program that both prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and meets certain minimum-length requirements. However, as a condition of certification to participate in Title IV programs, ED could require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. In the event that an institution is required to obtain ED’s approval for the addition of a new program, fails to do so, and erroneously determines that the new educational program is eligible for Title IV program funds, the institution could be liable for repayment of Title IV program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program.
Recent Legislative and ED Activity
Federal Legislative Activity
As a result of budgetary pressures, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation that impact the funding of Title IV and other tuition assistance programs. Due to the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and significant political interest in the cost of education, Congress continues to show interest in regulation and oversight of institutions of higher education, especially those that are for-profit.
Sequestration and Budgetary Matters
45

On August 2, 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 which put into place a series of automatic federal budget cuts, known as sequestration. The budget cuts, or sequestration, impacted certain federal student aid programs beginning in fiscal year 2013. While the Pell Grant program was specifically exempted from the effects of sequestration in fiscal year 2013 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2017, increased the maximum award to $5,920 in the 2017-2018 award, the Pell Grant program could be subject to cuts or changes in the future. While sequestration does not otherwise change the amount or terms or conditions of Direct Loan Program loans, including Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, it raised the loan fee paid by borrowers for Direct Loan Program loans disbursed after March 1, 2013. Cuts to ED’s administrative budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in origination and processing of federal student loans.
After sequestration took effect, the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps announced the suspension of their tuition assistance programs. Congress subsequently approved legislation requiring DoD to restore its tuition assistance programs, and each branch of the military restored its tuition assistance program. The DoD tuition assistance programs were again temporarily suspended during the October 2013 U.S. government partial shutdown. As a result of continued uncertainty about the availability of funding, several of the military branches announced changes to their tuition assistances programs that took effect in federal fiscal year 2014. For example, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance and has reduced the total benefit per service member per year from $4,500 to $4,000, the Coast Guard has also reduced total per service member annual benefits, and the Marine Corps now requires Marines to have 24 months on active duty prior to being eligible to apply for TA. Additional changes to the tuition assistance programs could occur, including due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes. 
Funding for the federal government, including the DoD, lapsed on January 20, 2018, and the federal government partially shut down for a few days. On January 22, 2017, Congress enacted a continuing resolution to extend funding for the federal government, including the DoD, through February 8, 2018. Funding for the federal government lapsed again on February 9, 2018, resulting in a government shutdown that lasted several hours. Later on February 9, 2018, Congress enacted a continuing resolution to extend funding for the federal government through March 23, 2018; however, if funding is not extended beyond that date a government shutdown could occur resulting in a suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs. A government shutdown or suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
Higher Education Act
The HEA must be periodically reauthorized by Congress and each Title IV program must be funded through appropriations acts on an annual basis. The most recent comprehensive reauthorization occurred in 2008 when Congress reauthorized most HEA programs through the 2014 federal fiscal year by passing the HEOA. Authorization of appropriations for most HEA programs is currently provided through June 30, 2018 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.
Congress continues to discuss reauthorization of the HEA. In December 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce considered and passed out of committee the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act, or PROSPER Act, to reauthorize the HEA. In its current form, the PROSPER Act would make dramatic changes to the HEA by, among other things, eliminating the 90/10 Rule and regulation of gainful employment programs, and replacing current accountability metrics linked to cohort default rates with metrics linked to timely loan repayment. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has begun to hold hearings on HEA reauthorization, and the Chairman has issued a white paper including a number of policy proposals for consideration. We cannot predict whether, in what form, or when, the two houses of Congress will reauthorize the HEA or whether, or when, the President will sign reauthorization legislation. The foregoing or other amendments to the HEA could occur as part of reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. 
Regulatory Activity
ED’s Accreditation Initiative
On November 6, 2015, ED announced several executive actions to increase transparency and rigor in accreditation. ED announced the launch of a new ED website on which it has published each accreditor’s current standards related to student outcomes and student and institutional metrics. ED will require all accreditors to forward to ED probation decision letters, the publicly releasable portions of which ED will publish on its website. ED also announced the request of a report on strategies to improve information coordination between and among accreditors and ED. ED announced that it will ensure decision-makers in the accreditor recognition process, such as members of NACIQI, have information including outcomes data, state and federal

litigation reports, and other information about institutions accredited by each accrediting agency. Acknowledging that its authority related to accreditation and student outcomes is restricted under the HEA, ED also made several proposals for legislative change related to accreditation. Increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the Secretary of Education and Congress in connection with ED’s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies.
ED’s Student Aid Enforcement Unit
On February 8, 2016, ED announced the creation of a Student Aid Enforcement Unit, or the Enforcement Unit, to enable ED to respond more quickly and efficiently to allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions. The Enforcement Unit consists of four divisions, including an Investigations Group, a Borrower Defense Group, an Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group, and a Clery Group. The Enforcement Unit collaborates with partner state and federal agencies to enforce violations of law. The Enforcement Unit also works with ED’s Program Compliance Unit to review evidence that may affect program reviews. The creation of the Enforcement Unit was designed to ensure that ED can support more reviews of what it refers to as “high-risk institutions,” respond to concerns raised by states’ and other federal agencies’ investigations, and respond to complaints and claims for loan forgiveness by students. ED has indicated that the Investigations Group will utilize a broad set of interventions and tools, including subpoena authority, document demands, and interrogatories and interviews to enforce against violations of federal law. In August 2017, ED announced a new leader of the Enforcement Unit, who will report to the head of ED’s Compliance Unit.
Executive Order
Executive Order 13777, “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,” signed by the President on February 24, 2017, directs federal agencies including ED to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the agency head regarding the regulations. The first Progress Report from the ED Regulatory Reform Task Force identifies a list of over 150 ED regulations that will be reviewed by the Task Force. The Progress Report also notes that the Task Force will review 1,772 issues of policy-related guidance that are subject to the Executive Order. In connection with Executive Order 13777, on June 22, 2017, ED announced that it was seeking public input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification. We submitted written comments on September 20, 2017.
Federal Rulemakings
As discussed above, ED has convened two negotiated rulemaking committees. On June 16, 2017, ED announced that it would convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Final GE Regulations. ED held two public hearings and solicited written comment from the public with respect to the agenda for the negotiated rulemaking committee, which met for the first time in December 2017. We submitted written comments on the agenda for the negotiated rulemaking committee on July 12, 2017. The negotiated rulemaking committee held meetings in December 2017 and February 2018 and is scheduled to meet again in March 2018. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted as a result of this rulemaking process. 
On June 16, 2017, ED announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Borrower Defense Regulations and to address certain other related matters. On August 30, 2017, ED announced that as part of the negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the Borrower Defense Regulations it would form a subcommittee to focus on potential modifications to ED’s financial responsibility regulations. The negotiated rulemaking committee held meetings in November 2017, January 2018, and February 2018 but the members of the committee did not reach consensus on proposed regulatory language. As a result, ED may propose regulatory language, with no obligation to use language negotiated or agreed-upon during the committee meetings. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted. 
The States
As discussed above in “Consumer Protection - Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints,” many states have become more active in regulating proprietary education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically in regards to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. Since our institutions operate in many jurisdictions, our institutions may be subject to regulations promulgated by a variety of regulators.
