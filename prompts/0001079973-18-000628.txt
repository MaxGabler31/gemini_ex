ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.
General
 
Hartford Great Health Corp. ("the Company", “Hartford” "we", "us" or our") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 ("Inception) under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 20, 2018 and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as set forth below.
Overview
 
Up until August 2018, we provided social networking and photo sharing from the website PhotoAmigo.com.   We also maintained the domain names PhotoAmigo.net, fotoamigo.com and fotoamigo.net.  These domain names all redirect incoming traffic to our main website, PhotoAmigo.com.
 
In August 2018, the Company changed its future plans of operations. The following business plan is based on research and discussions between the board and third party suppliers and experts. Only preliminary activities relating to the following objectives have been undertaken and therefore, there is no assurance that any of the proposed activities set forth below will be started by the Company or if started will be successful.
 
Strategy
 
Hartford Great Health Corp, a US OTC publicly traded company, plans to establish a subsidiary company in Shanghai called, Hartford Health Management (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. The subsidiary will be located at 38/F, BM Tower, No. 218 Wu Song Road, Hongkou District, Shanghai, China.
 
The plan focuses on the development of the Sino-U.S. health industry in the following four areas:
 
A. Membership based program:
 
The company will develop an international membership-based program (International Anti-Aging Program) for middle to high-income Chinese members. Enrollment into the program will allow members to travel to the United States on a yearly basis for state-of-the-art stem cell treatments including stem cell extraction, storage, and injection from a collaborative of American biomedical stem cell experts. Members will receive stem cell treatments in the United States with a larger goal of enhancing immunity, youthfulness, and longevity. The initial estimated number of annual members is approximately 1800-2000 members.
 
B. Artificial Intelligence and Medical Equipment Sales:
 
The company will broker sales of cutting-edge artificial intelligence equipment (particularly robotics) to the United States to enhance the overall standard of personal health and the healthcare experience in the U.S. The company will also sell general health and wellness equipment to individual consumers in the United States with the overall goal of improving the personal healthcare experience of customers in the United States.
C. Mobile Lifestyle Management Platform:
 
The company will create an internet-based health consultation platform for Chinese and Chinese-American individuals. This online platform is designed to connect customers with health and wellness information curated by experts in the health consultation and wellness management fields. The online platform will keep customers informed about new wellness-related technologies and advances available to them through the company as well as about general health and wellness lifestyle advice catered towards Chinese-American audiences.
 
D. Integrated management of metabolic diseases:
 
The company plans to target three high-risk populations, individuals with: 1) hyperglycemia, 2) hypertension, and 3) hyperlipidemia. These three conditions are incredibly common amongst both Chinese and American populations; thus, the company plans to introduce an integrated approach to management and overall reduction of these three conditions using a unique combination of Western style supplements and over-the-counter products as well as traditional Chinese Meridian Acupoint Massage.
 There can be no assurance following consummation of any of the business ventures will develop into a going concern or, if the business is already operating, that it will continue to operate successfully. Many of the potential business opportunities available to the Company may involve new and untested products, processes or market strategies which may not ultimately prove successful.

The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company.
 
Management of the Company will pay all expenses incurred by the Company. Management does not expect any repayment for such paid expenses.
 
There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
 
 Competition
 
 We believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. Current and future competitors may have more resources than we have. 
  Health development is a highly competitive business. We will compete with numerous health organizations of which almost all of them have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. To successfully compete in our industry, we will need to: 

● | Ensure that investments in our projects are affordable; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | That our investment strategy is simple to understand; and 
● | That we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings.

  
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. We believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price. We are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services.
