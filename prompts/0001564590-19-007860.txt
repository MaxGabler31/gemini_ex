Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using our expertise in epigenetics to discover and develop novel therapeutics that address serious unmet medical needs in patients with cancers associated with abnormal gene expression or drug resistance. Our integrated epigenetics platform enables us to validate targets and generate small molecules against these targets that selectively modulate gene expression in tumor and immune cells to drive anti-tumor activity. This platform reflects our deep understanding of the biology of regulation of gene expression by epigenetic regulatory proteins, or epigenetic regulators, the development of small-molecule product candidates that selectively modulate their activity, and the design of clinical development programs supported by novel biomarker strategies. We are able to target a broad variety of epigenetic regulators using our platform and have generated development candidates acting against distinct classes of those regulators. 
 We utilized our epigenetics platform to discover and design our wholly owned product candidates CPI-0610, CPI-1205, and CPI-0209. We continue to leverage this platform and our clinical experience to develop these product candidates and to discover and develop additional product candidates. CPI-0610 inhibits bromodomain and extra terminal domain, or BET, proteins. CPI-1205 and CPI-0209 inhibit the enhancer of zeste homolog 2, or EZH2, protein. We believe that our approach to targeting these central gene regulatory mechanisms associated with cancer proliferation may enable us to provide therapeutic benefits to cancer patients. We have observed clinical activity in patients treated with CPI-0610 in an ongoing Phase 2 trial in patients with myelofibrosis, or MF, and with CPI-1205 in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, in combination with androgen receptor signaling, or ARS, inhibitors. We aim to provide data from the Phase 1b portion of ProSTAR, our clinical trial of CPI-1205 in patients with mCRPC, at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting, referred to as the AACR meeting, on April 1, 2019, and data from approximately 18-20 evaluable patients from MANIFEST, our Phase 2 trial of CPI-0610 in patients with MF, at another medical meeting in the second quarter of 2019. We also aim to provide additional data updates on CPI-0610 and CPI-1205 in the second half of 2019. If we meet our primary endpoints in our ongoing clinicals trials of CPI-0610 and CPI-1205 and after consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, regarding acceptable endpoints, we plan to advance these product candidates into pivotal clinical trials in MF and mCRPC, respectively. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for our third product candidate, the second-generation EZH2 inhibitor CPI-0209, in mid-2019.  
 BET Inhibitor 
 CPI-0610, one of our two lead product candidates, is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting the function of BET proteins, which normally enhance target gene expression. We are currently conducting MANIFEST, a Phase 2 clinical trial of CPI-0610 as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi®/Jakavi®) in patients with MF, a progressive hematological cancer. We are enrolling MF patients in both a second-line and a first-line setting. In the second-line setting (patients who have already been treated with ruxolitinib), we are stratifying patients for dependence on red-blood-cell, or RBC, transfusions. In transfusion-dependent patients, we aim to measure conversion to transfusion independence. In non-transfusion-dependent patients, we aim to measure spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement, among other relevant parameters of antitumor activity, such as erythroid response. An erythroid response is defined as an increase in hemoglobin levels from baseline in the absence of RBC transfusions. We are also testing CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in a first-line setting (ruxolitinib-naïve patients) with the aim of measuring spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement, among other relevant parameters.
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve treatment of MF patients. Ruxolitinib is the only approved drug therapy and is the standard of care for MF. In clinical trials, ruxolitinib has been shown to reduce spleen volume and improve patient-reported symptoms in a minority of patients. However, ruxolitinib has been associated with worsening hematological parameters, including anemia and transfusion dependence. The product also has not demonstrated the ability to improve bone marrow fibrosis, which has been documented as a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in MF. Some patients cannot start treatment with ruxolitinib, in some cases because of low platelet levels, low hemoglobin levels or RBC transfusion dependence. Some other patients treated with ruxolitinib do not achieve the targeted clinical outcomes, such as a 35% reduction in spleen volume or improvement in symptom scores. Some patients in clinical trials discontinued use of ruxolitinib within three to five years due to side effects or relapse / recurrence of their disease.

Preliminary data from MANIFEST suggest that CPI-0610 has the potential to offer meaningful benefits beyond the current standard of care in MF. We have observed preliminary evidence of activity of CPI-0610 as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib across a range of parameters in MF. They include reduction in spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI; improvements in patient-reported symptoms; improvements in anemia and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence; and improvements in bone marrow fibrosis. While these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger dataset, we believe that these results suggest that CPI-0610 may have disease-modifying effects. Enrollment is on track in this trial. We now have approximately 20 clinical trial sites in U.S., Canada and Europe. We aim to provide an interim update of data from MANIFEST at a medical meeting in the second quarter of 2019 and to provide an additional data update in the second half of 2019. Assuming that the clinical data are sufficiently positive and after consultation with FDA regarding acceptable endpoints, we would expect to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of CPI-0610 in MF. 
 We believe that CPI-0610 may have a differentiated safety profile compared with some other BET inhibitors. Prior to initiating the MANIFEST study, we demonstrated that CPI-0610 was well tolerated across three Phase 1 clinical trials in which we treated a total of 138 patients with a variety of hematological malignancies. In a Phase 1 trial in lymphoma, we identified the maximum tolerated dose of 225 mg per day. We have seen clinical activity at a range of doses below this maximum tolerated dose, including the 125 mg starting dose being used in the MANIFEST clinical trial. We can titrate the dose upward to 225 mg per day and have done so without additional toxicity. We believe this favorable therapeutic window may differentiate CPI-0610 from some other BET inhibitors. The dose-limiting toxicity for other BET inhibitors, which is thrombocytopenia, has been shown to be dose-dependent, non-cumulative and reversible at the maximum tolerated CPI-0610 dose of 225 mg in MF patients treated to date.  
 EZH2 Franchise 
 CPI-1205, our other lead product candidate, is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting EZH2, an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression. Based on insights from our platform and the advancing body of scientific literature supporting the role of EZH2 in certain tumor types, including prostate cancer, we prioritized clinical development of CPI-1205 as a combination therapy for mCRPC. We are currently conducting an open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CPI-1205 for the treatment of mCRPC in combination with the ARS inhibitors enzalutamide (marketed as Xtandi®) or abiraterone acetate (marketed as Zytiga®), a clinical trial that we refer to as the ProSTAR trial. Abiraterone acetate is dosed with prednisone, which is the current clinical practice. Preliminary data to date from this trial suggest CPI-1205 has the potential to offer meaningful benefits beyond the current standard of care. We have seen preliminary evidence of reductions in prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, reductions in circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, tumor shrinkages, and extended duration of response in ProSTAR. We aim to disclose Phase 1b data from ProSTAR at the AACR meeting on April 1, 2019 and an interim update on Phase 2 data in the second half of 2019. If the ProSTAR trial is successful, we expect to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of CPI-1205 in combination with either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate for the treatment of mCRPC. 
 We believe that targeting EZH2 has the potential for broad therapeutic application in a variety of tumor types, and we have taken a franchise approach to targeting EZH2. We believe that CPI-0209, our second-generation and potentially best-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, may enable us to address additional patient populations beyond those that have been targeted by first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. Based on this belief, we designed CPI-0209 to achieve comprehensive coverage of EZH2. We have seen evidence of preclinical activity of CPI-0209 both as a single agent and in combination with other agents. We believe this compound has broad application in large patient populations across several solid tumors. We are currently advancing CPI-0209 in IND-enabling studies and expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors in mid-2019.

Our Pipeline 
 The following table summarizes key information about our most advanced programs: 

We have retained global development and commercial rights to all of our product candidates. Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with the ability to commercialize our products. Our management team has extensive experience, including senior roles at leading pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development, regulatory review, and commercialization of cancer therapeutics. 
 In addition, we have a preclinical pipeline of compounds that target the microenvironment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies, as well as compounds that target innate immunity in solid tumors. We aim to test these molecules in clinical trials in indications with a defined biological rationale, utilizing trial designs that are supported by biomarkers for patient enrichment. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative drugs that address the serious unmet medical needs of patients with cancers that are associated with abnormal gene expression or drug resistance. To achieve our objective, we aim to: 

• | Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our two lead clinical programs necessary to advance them into pivotal trials. Building off the clinical activity that we have observed with CPI-0610 in a Phase 2 trial in patients with MF and with CPI-1205 in a Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with mCRPC, we aim in 2019 to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each of these product candidates necessary to advance them into pivotal studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable pivotal trial with CPI-0610 in MF and CPI-1205 in prostate cancer. Assuming we demonstrate safety and efficacy for our lead compounds necessary to advance them into pivotal trials, we aim to build the organization and other capabilities needed to initiate pivotal clinical trials with each product candidate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance CPI-0209 through IND-enabling studies and into clinical trials to determine efficacy and safety. We believe that targeting EZH2 has the potential for broad therapeutic application in a variety of tumor types and have taken a franchise approach to targeting EZH2. Leveraging our translational insights, we will prioritize solid tumor indications for biomarker-supported clinical trials. We believe CPI-0209 could achieve more comprehensive coverage of EZH2 than first-generation EZH2 inhibitors and enable us to address additional patient populations beyond those that have been targeted by first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. We are currently advancing CPI-0209 in IND-enabling studies and expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of this product candidate in solid tumors in 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our preclinical portfolio to generate additional assets with compelling clinical development paths. We are leveraging our platform to discover and develop programs focused on the inhibition of epigenetic regulators of tumor and/or immune cells that may lead to the killing or reprogramming of cancer cells and/or result in anti-tumor immune activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the global commercial potential of our product candidates. We currently plan to retain commercial rights to our product candidates in the United States while selectively evaluating strategic partnerships that could maximize their commercial potential by expanding our geographic reach or by development in additional indications.

Cancer and Epigenetics 
 Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancer can arise when the dysregulation of the affected cell’s gene expression program alters the identity and function of normal cells. This dysregulation can arise when there are changes in genes that control signaling pathways governing cell differentiation and function. Cancer cells can utilize this abnormal gene expression by using epigenetic regulators to activate pro-tumor genes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, cancer cells can also use epigenetic regulators to activate resistance mechanisms against cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, and render the treatments less effective. 
Epigenetics Background 
 Epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression by modifying chromatin, which consists of DNA wrapped around an assembly of proteins called histones. The DNA included in chromatin is identical in each cell in the body. The identity and function of each cell is determined by the specific set of genes that are expressed, or turned on or off, in a given cell. Whether a specific set of genes is turned on or off depends on the action of epigenetic regulators. 
 Epigenetic regulators change the architecture of chromatin, allowing it to adopt an open configuration to facilitate gene expression or, conversely, a closed configuration to suppress gene expression. An open chromatin configuration turns on a gene by allowing access and readout of the genetic information stored in DNA. A closed chromatin configuration turns off a gene by preventing access to DNA and results in silencing of gene expression. 
 We have focused our discovery and development efforts on three distinct classes of epigenetic regulators: 
  
• | Epigenetic writers, which are enzymes that add chemical modifications onto chromatin
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Epigenetic readers, which are protein families that recognize chemical modifications on chromatin and bind to these modifications using specialized protein domains
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Epigenetic erasers, which are enzymes that remove chemical modifications from chromatin
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The action of each class of epigenetic regulators can alter chromatin configuration and control the expression of certain genes in different ways. 
 As illustrated below, epigenetic regulators within the writer, reader, and eraser classes modify chromatin and affect gene expression by either adding, binding to or removing chemical tags, which are indicated by dots, on chromatin. In normal cells, these epigenetic mechanisms are tightly regulated so that genes are turned on or turned off as appropriate. 
 

4


Abnormal cells, such as proliferating cancer cells, can usurp these epigenetic mechanisms, ultimately leading to disease. In certain contexts, the activity of an epigenetic regulator may be altered due to a genetic mutation, which may make certain cancer cells dependent on the activity of an individual epigenetic regulator for cancer cell growth. In other contexts, cancer cells may use the activity of an epigenetic regulator cooperatively with other cellular factors to exacerbate disease-promoting mechanisms and suppress the effectiveness of drug therapies, including chemotherapeutic agents, targeted agents (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and immune-modulating agents (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors). 
 Epigenetics regulators also play a significant role in the differentiation of immune cell populations. The various immune cells in a human body arise from blood progenitor cells, or hematopoietic stem cells, through differentiation processes. Epigenetic regulators govern these differentiation processes by promoting and suppressing certain genes that are specific to each type of immune cell. Cancer cells can use epigenetic regulators to cause the differentiation process to produce or program immune cells that promote tumor immunity. The selective inhibition of these epigenetic regulators may alter this differentiation process and re-program immune cells that increase tumor immunity into immune cells that drive an anti-tumor response. This approach may allow immune cells to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
 Epigenetic Inhibitor Approaches 
 Epigenetic inhibition is particularly attractive as a therapeutic approach for several reasons: 
  
• | small-molecule inhibitors can block the abnormal function of epigenetic regulators that cancer cells depend on for growth and can potentially restore normal gene expression;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the large number of epigenetic regulators utilized by cells in the body to control gene expression represents a large number of potential drug targets; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | biomarkers can be used to enrich for patients who are most likely to respond to epigenetic inhibition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The early epigenetic inhibitors—such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors—have not delivered on the full potential of the inhibition of epigenetic regulators as a class of cancer therapy. These drugs cause broad changes to gene expression across thousands of genes. This broad inhibition, as opposed to more selective inhibition, generally resulted in unintended effects accompanying the desired effect. Moreover, early epigenetic inhibitors were solely designed to alter gene expression in cancer cells to induce cancer cell death. This approach did not consider the importance of the cells surrounding the cancer cells, referred to as the tumor microenvironment, and the supporting role that epigenetic regulators play in sustaining the tumor microenvironment for cancer cell growth. 
 Since these early epigenetic drugs, biopharmaceutical development has focused on therapies targeting epigenetic regulators in genetically defined cancer contexts, and specifically in mutated epigenetic regulators with abnormal function that cancer cells depend on for growth. This approach has identified a small number of epigenetic targets and development opportunities for certain targets, including EZH2. Given that the abnormal function of epigenetic regulators can arise for reasons other than genetic mutations, we believe that these genetically defined approaches, while valuable, underestimate the potential of identifying and specifically targeting epigenetic regulators in cancer. 
 Our Approach 
 We are a pioneer in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that target the writer, reader, and eraser classes of epigenetic regulators and modulate gene expression in a more selective manner than early epigenetic drugs. Our efforts have demonstrated that these distinct classes of epigenetic regulators are broadly druggable and that selective reprogramming of gene expression is a promising therapeutic approach not only to induce cancer cell killing but also to enhance anti-tumor immunity. 
Integrated Platform 
 Our integrated epigenetics platform includes a deep understanding of the biological context in which epigenetic regulators operate, the development of small-molecule product candidates that selectively modulate their activity and the design of clinical development programs supported by novel biomarker strategies. 
 Understanding the biological context. We have built a suite of tools that enables us to identify and validate epigenetic target biology. Specifically, we have built a chemical probe library comprising selective and potent small molecules that each inhibit the activity of a specific epigenetic regulator. In addition, we have also built libraries of genetic tools that help us understand the function of specific genes that encode epigenetic regulators. We routinely screen these small molecules and genetic tools across cellular and animal models of disease to identify and validate potential epigenetic targets. We have utilized these tools to identify epigenetic targets that, when inhibited, induce cancer cell death, sensitize tumor cells to an immune response and reprogram immune-suppressive immune cells to enhance anti-tumor activity.

Development of small-molecule product candidates. Our small-molecule drug discovery engine is supported by our deep understanding of the writer, reader, and eraser classes of epigenetic regulators. We have spent over ten years developing this understanding, and that expertise, combined with our capabilities in assay development, biochemistry, compound screening, medicinal chemistry, and structural biology, provides a strong platform to continue to develop small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors. As a result, we have been able to develop multiple product candidates across our target classes, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. 
 Design of clinical development programs. We believe that our ability to link biological and clinical development to identify a path to registration for each of our product candidates is a crucial component of our platform. We prioritize indications based on the importance of a specific epigenetic target as a driver of a specific cancer. We also evaluate in vivo models, cancer cell line panels, and human tumor samples to identify biomarkers that can be used to identify patient populations that may be most likely to respond to treatment with our product candidates. We create and use a range of assays in our preclinical and early clinical testing to validate hypotheses that we may use in later-stage testing to target specific patient populations. 
 Our approach to therapeutic agents is focused on epigenetic targets: 
  
• | whose inhibition modulates gene expression in a highly selective manner;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | with broad development opportunities, including biomarker-defined contexts, which we believe may expand the applicability of our product candidates to cancers with immune evasion or acquired drug resistance; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | whose inhibition may reprogram immune-suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our epigenetics platform allows us to intervene in diseases by targeting distinct classes of epigenetic regulators, including the following examples: 
  
• | EZH2—an epigenetic writer—is an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression by adding modifications to chromatin. Certain cancer and immune cells can use EZH2 to promote growth of cancer cells or suppress an anti-tumor immune response;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BET proteins—a group of epigenetic readers—are proteins that bind to chromatin and enhance target gene expression. Certain cancer cells can use BET proteins to promote growth of cancer cells and inflammatory disorders; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LSD1—an epigenetic eraser—is an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression by removing modifications from chromatin. Certain cancer cells and immune cells can utilize lysine-specific demethylase 1A, or LSD1, to promote growth of cancer cells or suppress an anti-tumor immune response.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we can leverage our epigenetic platform to expand our discovery and development efforts into additional classes of epigenetic targets. We are also currently advancing several discovery programs against undisclosed epigenetic regulators focused on the tumor microenvironment and the immune microenvironment. 
 Our Product Candidates 
 CPI-0610—BET Inhibitor 
 Overview 
 BET proteins are epigenetic readers that turn on specific genes by binding unique regions of the genome through their ability to read specific chemical tags on chromatin. In some instances, BET proteins turn on genes that are abnormally expressed in a variety of human cancers. BET inhibitors downregulate the expression of oncogenes, which are key genes that have the potential to cause cancer, such as MYC or NF-κB target genes, and effectively kill many cancer cell lines in in vitro models. These observations resulted in the generation and clinical investigation of BET inhibitors in several cancer subtypes. We have observed clinical activity in cancer subtypes that are driven by NF-κB signaling. 
 CPI-0610 is a potent and selective small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by selectively inhibiting the function of BET proteins to decrease the expression of abnormally expressed genes in cancer. Our epigenetics platform reflects our deep understanding of the biological contexts in which BET proteins operate, including cancer pathways that are highly sensitive to CPI-0610. A combination of our preclinical studies, as well as translational insights from our first-in-human study of CPI-0610, led us to prioritize the clinical development of CPI-0610 in MF. 
 6


We are currently enrolling patients in an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as the MANIFEST trial, of CPI-0610 as a first-line or second-line treatment for MF, a progressive hematological cancer. There are no approved products for patients with MF whose disease progresses after treatment with ruxolitinib. In the second-line setting in patients who are refractory to, have an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of ruxolitinib, we are testing CPI-0610 as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib treatment. Preliminary data from the second-line portion of this Phase 2 trial suggest that CPI-0610 has the potential to offer disease-modifying effects. We have observed evidence of activity of CPI-0610 both as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib, including a reduction in spleen volume and symptom improvement. We have also observed improvements in hemoglobin and platelet counts in three of the first four enrolled monotherapy patients and improvement of bone marrow fibrosis score in the first two evaluable patients. We are also testing CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in the first-line setting in ruxolitinib-naïve patients, and data are not yet available. Enrollment is on track in this trial. We now have approximately 20 clinical trial sites in U.S., Canada and Europe. We aim to provide an interim update on data from the MANIFEST trial from approximately 18-20 evaluable patients at a medical meeting in the second quarter of 2019 and an additional update in the second half of 2019. If the data are sufficiently positive, and after consultation with the FDA regarding acceptable endpoints, we aim to initiate a pivotal clinical trial or trials of CPI-0610 in MF. 
 We believe that CPI-0610 may have a differentiated safety profile compared to some other BET inhibitors. CPI-0610 was well tolerated across three Phase 1 clinical trials in which we treated a total of 138 patients who had a variety of hematological malignancies. In Phase 1 trials we identified the maximum tolerated dose of 225 mg per day. We have seen clinical activity at a range of doses below this maximum tolerated dose, including the 125 mg per day starting dose being used in the MANIFEST clinical trial. We believe this favorable therapeutic window may differentiate CPI-0610 from some other BET inhibitors. The common on-target, dose-limiting toxicity for BET inhibitors is thrombocytopenia, which has been shown to be dose-dependent, non-cumulative and reversible with CPI-0610 in patients treated to date.  
 BET Inhibition in Cancer 
 Abnormal BET function has been implicated in cancer through several means, including chromosomal translocation and gene amplification and overexpression whereby oncogenic and inflammatory signals are turned on in cancer cells through altered BET activity. 
 Of note, BET proteins control the expression of the target genes of NF-κB, a key immune signaling pathway that is abnormally activated in various diseases, including cancer and immune disorders. NF-κB signaling has been shown to be abnormally high in some hematological malignancies, such as MF and activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or ABC-DLBCL. In preclinical studies in MF, animals treated with BET inhibitors alone or in combination with a JAK2 inhibitor displayed a reduction in NF-κB target gene expression, improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and reduced disease burden. 
 In addition, BET proteins promote the generation of megakaryocytes from hematopoietic stem cells. We believe that the blood cells most responsible for bone marrow scarring in MF are dysfunctional megakaryocytes, which proliferate and produce inflammatory molecules in part through elevated NF-κB signaling. 
 Myelofibrosis 
 MF is part of a collection of progressive blood cancers known as myeloproliferative neoplasms and is associated with significantly reduced quality of life and shortened survival. As the disease progresses, the bone marrow produces fewer red blood cells. Within one year of diagnosis, the incidence of thrombocytopenia increases significantly. Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by low platelet counts in the blood, severe anemia (a condition characterized by low red-blood-cell counts), and red-blood-cell transfusion requirements. Among other complications, most patients with MF have enlarged spleens as well as many other physical symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, bone pain and extreme fatigue. 
 There are limited treatment options for patients with MF. Ruxolitinib is the current standard of care and the only approved drug treatment for intermediate- and high-risk MF patients. Ruxolitinib inhibits dysregulated janus kinase 1 and 2, or JAK1/JAK2, signaling that is associated with MF. Ruxolitinib produces spleen reduction and symptom improvement in MF patients. However, its side effects include increased anemia and transfusion dependence. In the SIMPLIFY-1 clinical trial of ruxolitinib in JAK-naïve patients, transfusion dependence increased from 24.0% to 40.1% after 24 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib has not been shown to have a significant effect on bone marrow fibrosis reversion, which has been documented as a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in MF. Many patients cannot initiate ruxolitinib therapy. Many other patients may not tolerate treatment with ruxolitinib or will have an insufficient response. Patients generally have poor prospects for survival following discontinuation of therapy with ruxolitinib. 
 7


Data from the MANIFEST trial as of December 10, 2018, show preliminary evidence of improved hemoglobin and platelet levels, conversion to transfusion independence (which we believe, based on clinical feedback, rarely happens spontaneously in MF patients) and improved bone marrow fibrosis, suggesting that CPI-0610 may have disease-modifying effects in MF. We believe that there are no disease-modifying drugs as first or subsequent lines of therapy approved for treatment of patients suffering from MF.
 We believe that at least two-thirds of the 17,000 to 20,000 of the MF patients in the United States are intermediate- or / high-risk patients and are therefore eligible for systemic treatment, including ruxolitinib. Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, which markets ruxolitinib, has estimated that 40% of these eligible patients receive treatment with ruxolitinib. We believe that CPI-0610 may provide a treatment option for patients who cannot be treated with, or who receive an inadequate response to, ruxolitinib.
 Clinical Development 
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial. We are evaluating CPI-0610 in an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial as a second-line treatment for MF. In this trial, we are enrolling patients in a combination arm of CPI-0610 with ruxolitinib or in a monotherapy arm. In the combination arm, we are enrolling patients who have an inadequate response or lack of response while being treated with ruxolitinib, but who remain on ruxolitinib treatment. In this arm, we add on CPI-0610 to ruxolitinib treatment. In the monotherapy arm, we are enrolling patients who had disease progression despite prior treatment with ruxolitinib or discontinued ruxolitinib due to toxicity or certain patients who are not eligible for treatment with ruxolitinib. We have stratified patients for dependence on red-blood-cell transfusion in both the combination and monotherapy arms with a goal to better understand the impact of CPI-0610 on both transfusion-dependent and transfusion-independent patients. We begin treatment with each patient at a dose of 125 mg of CPI-0610 once per day in each arm of the trial and may titrate up to 225 mg, which was the maximum tolerated dose in our Phase 1 trial in patients with lymphoma. We are evaluating safety, pharmacokinetics, spleen size measured by MRI and palpation, patient-reported symptom assessment, and red-blood-cell and platelet counts. We are also testing CPI-0610 in combination with ruxolitinib in ruxolitinib-naïve patients (first-line setting). We are also collecting and analyzing biomarkers to assess molecular features of the biology of BET proteins and myeloid cells, which may allow us to enrich for patients who are most likely to respond to treatment with CPI-0610. 


Note: CPI-0610 is dosed in 21-day cycles, with 14 days on treatment and 7 days off treatment. 
 Enrollment is on track in this trial. We now have approximately 20 clinical trial sites in U.S., Canada and Europe. As of February 28, 2019, we had enrolled 28 patients in the second-line arms. As of the last data cutoff on December 10, 2018, two of these patients in the combination arm had been treated for longer than 16 months and two of these patients in the monotherapy arm had been treated for longer than 12 months. The primary endpoints of this trial are the reduction in spleen volume from baseline measured by MRI after 24 weeks of treatment and the red-blood-cell transfusion independence rate in patients who are transfusion dependent at baseline. Red-blood-cell transfusion independence is defined as absence of red-blood-cell transfusions. Secondary endpoints of the trial include change in patient-reported outcomes and the frequency of red-blood-cell transfusions. 
 8


We have observed preliminary evidence of clinical activity from the four patients that have been treated in the trial for more than one year. Specifically, as of December 10, 2018, we observed spleen volume reduction from baseline measured by MRI in each patient. The figure below shows the best spleen volume response as measured by MRI for each of the four patients as of December 10, 2018. 



We also observed symptom improvement in each of these four patients. We have also observed improvements in red-blood-cell counts in three of four patients, indicating a possible improvement in bone marrow function. One patient who required regular red-blood-cell transfusions prior to treatment has been transfusion independent for more than 52 weeks as of December 10, 2018. Additionally, despite not receiving red-blood-cell transfusions, the patient’s hemoglobin levels have increased substantially, and the patient’s platelet counts also improved during this period. The figure below presents, as of December 10, 2018, the hemoglobin levels and platelet counts during the trial of this patient, including both the transfusion-dependent and transfusion-independent periods. 
 Transfusion-Dependent Patient Treated with CPI-0610 and Ruxolitinib

We saw trends of increasing hemoglobin levels in each of the four patients treated for more than one year in the MANIFEST trial, as seen below:

We observed evidence of bone marrow improvement in the first two patients evaluable for this condition. These patients were treated with CPI-0610 as a monotherapy. As of December 10, 2018, each of these patients experienced an improvement of one grade (on a scale of 3-0) in bone marrow fibrosis, as seen in the images below obtained from reticulin staining:
 
The safety profile of CPI-0610 in the MANIFEST trial as of December 10, 2018, has generally been consistent with that observed in Phase 1 clinical trials, which is discussed below. The patient population being tested includes several patients with multiple mutations that we believe may indicate a poor prognosis.
 
In October 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to CPI-0610 in treatment of myelofibrosis. The FDA grants Fast Track designation to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and fill unmet medical needs. A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval, more frequent written communication about the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers, eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review, and rolling review.
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial. We evaluated CPI-0610 in three Phase 1 clinical trials in an aggregate of 138 patients with hematological malignancies. We treated 64 patients with lymphoma, 44 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, and 30 patients with multiple myeloma. In each trial, we evaluated CPI-0610 administered daily for two weeks followed by one week with no treatment. CPI-0610 was well tolerated in each trial. 
 The primary endpoint of each trial was to establish the safety of CPI-0610 as a single agent by evaluating the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities associated with treatment with CPI-0610 in a 21 days’ cycle, consisting of 14 days on and 7 days off the drug. In our trial in patients with lymphoma, we determined 225 mg of CPI-0610 once daily to be the maximum tolerated dose, with the dose-limiting toxicity being thrombocytopenia, which is an on-target dose-dependent toxicity generally associated with BET inhibition. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 17% of the patients treated across three Phase 1 trials of CPI-0610. The platelet count recovered in most patients who experienced thrombocytopenia after one week off

treatment of CPI-0610. One case of thrombocytopenia was determined to be a treatment-related serious adverse event. There were 29 treatment-related serious adverse events in the three trials, consisting of diarrhea (five cases), vomiting (two cases), hypertension (two cases), pleuritic pain (two cases), and one case each of abdominal pain, abnormal liver function test, adrenal hemorrhage, adrenal insufficiency, chills, colitis, confusion, dehydration, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, genital herpes, hyponatremia, hypotension, increase in blood creatine, lung infection, mania, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events included nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, dysgeusia, and anemia. 
 In the dose-seeking trial of CPI-0610 in patients with lymphoma, there were 38 evaluable patients, and we observed four objective responses, consisting of two complete responses and two partial responses under the 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson criteria) by investigator assessment. We also observed reductions in tumor size in patients that did not qualify as objective responses. One patient who had a complete response underwent curative bone marrow transplantation after treatment with CPI-0610. Moreover, three patients with ABC-DLBCL, a cancer subtype characterized by high levels of NF-κB signaling, who were treated at therapeutic levels (at least 125 mg of CPI-0610) experienced an objective response, consisting of one complete response and two partial responses. 
 CPI-1205—EZH2 Inhibitor 
 Overview 
 Historically, the primary focus of EZH2 as a drug target has been the role of EZH2 mutations or overexpression in cancer. We believe these genetically defined approaches to EZH2 inhibition may underestimate the broader therapeutic potential of the target in cancer. EZH2 genomic aberrations and overexpression are frequently correlated with late-stage cancer and a poor prognosis for a wide variety of cancers, including prostate cancer. Furthermore, EZH2 also cooperates with other cancer-promoting pathways, such as androgen receptor signaling and immune signaling. Therefore, we believe EZH2 inhibition can synergistically enhance the effectiveness of existing cancer therapies. 
 CPI-1205, one of our two lead product candidates, is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting EZH2, an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression. In in vitro and in vivo models, we observed a dose-proportional inhibition of EZH2 by CPI-1205 that correlated with the tumor-growth-inhibiting activity. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of CPI-1205 as a monotherapy in 32 patients with relapsed B-cell lymphoma in which CPI-1205 demonstrated clinical activity and was well tolerated. 
 We also observed in preclinical studies that CPI-1205 inhibited tumor growth as a single agent and synergistically enhanced the efficacy of cancer therapies, including ARS inhibitors, in a prostate cancer model. Based on these observations and the limited options for patients who progress on ARS inhibitors, we prioritized clinical development of CPI-1205 as a combination therapy with ARS inhibitors in mCRPC. 
 There is a significant need for new therapies in mCRPC, particularly in a second-line setting. Approximately 60-80% of patients taking an ARS inhibitor (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate) first-line achieve PSA reductions of 50% or more, with PSA progression-free survival generally ranging from 9 to 15 months. When patients’ response to this first-line therapy becomes inadequate, second-line therapy generally consists of switching patients to the other approved ARS inhibitor. Data from a third-party study presented at the 2018 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or the Chi study, showed the following PSA responses and time to progression for abiraterone acetate use as a second-line treatment after enzalutamide and enzalutamide use as a second-line treatment after abiraterone acetate:

Thirty-six patients were enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of the ProSTAR trial of CPI-1205 in mCRPC in combination with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. This clinical trial established the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CPI-1205 combined with the standard dose of either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate. We observed evidence of clinical activity in both arms of the trial. We observed evidence of clinical activity as measured by each of the parameters evaluated in the trial —PSA reductions, CTC reductions and objective responses by RECIST. The patient population in ProSTAR Phase 1b differed from that in the Chi study mentioned above in several respects, such as that the ProSTAR Phase 1b trial included patients who had received prior chemotherapy treatments and patients with worse prognosis than those in the Chi study.
 Based on the clinical observations in the Phase 1b portion of ProSTAR trial and the determination of the recommended dose in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, we initiated the Phase 2 portion of the trial. We are studying CPI-1205 in combination with both enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate based on the clinical activity and safety profile demonstrated by CPI-1205 with either of these two ARS inhibitors in the Phase 1b portion. The Phase 2 portion consists of a randomized trial of CPI-1205 + enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone, as well as a single arm evaluating CPI-1205 + abiraterone acetate / prednisone. The abiraterone acetate arm of the Phase 2 study was designed as a single arm given the very low response rate and short duration of response observed in abiraterone acetate treatment in clinical trials of second-line treatment of mCRPC, including the Chi study. We have initiated dosing in the Phase 2 portion in both the enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate arms. In addition, as a result of encouraging results observed in a heavily pretreated compassionate-use patient, we have also added an arm to the ProSTAR trial for heavily pretreated patients who have progressed on abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy and have measurable soft-tissue metastatic disease.
 Enrollment is on track in the Phase 2 portion of this trial. We aim to present data from the Phase 1b portion of ProSTAR at the AACR meeting on April 1, 2019, and an update on initial Phase 2 data in the second half of 2019. Preliminary data from this trial suggest CPI-1205 has the potential to offer benefits beyond the current standard of care. If the ProSTAR trial is successful, we expect to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of CPI-1205 in combination with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate for the treatment of mCRPC. 
 EZH2 Inhibition in Cancer 
 EZH2 acts as an epigenetic writer and normally regulates gene expression by placing one or more methyl groups on a histone protein leading to the suppression of gene expression programs. While this effect of EZH2 on gene expression is a normal part of cellular development, some cancers depend on an abnormal pattern of gene expression and re-direct EZH2 to genes that become abnormally repressed. Cancer cells with these abnormal gene expression programs may be more resistant to anti-cancer therapies. 
 Abnormal EZH2 function has been implicated in cancer in a number of ways: 
  
• | Cancer genetics: mutations in the gene encoding EZH2 result in the altered enzymatic activity of EZH2, and cancer cells become dependent on this abnormal activity for tumor growth. Alternatively, mutations in other epigenetic regulators can change the genes expressed by cancer cells and indirectly create a dependence on EZH2 for cancer cell growth;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquired drug resistance: therapeutic agents promote EZH2-mediated gene silencing that may lead to acquired resistance to these agents; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immune suppression: EZH2 mediates reprogramming of immune cells within the tumor, e.g., T-cells, and tumor cells to create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is a strong association between EZH2 expression and disease progression in mCRPC. A therapeutic approach that targets EZH2 may result in better outcomes than those achieved with approved therapeutic agents that treat mCRPC. 
 In prostate cancer, the androgen receptor is a key regulator of gene expression and acts as the mediator of androgen signaling in prostate cells. The AR signaling pathway is the primary pathway used by prostate cancer cells to promote tumor growth. As shown below, we believe that EZH2, by suppressing certain gene sets, enhances AR signaling, which can lead to increased tumor growth. 
 12


In preclinical studies, we observed enhanced gene expression changes in prostate cancer cells treated with a combination of enzalutamide and CPI-1205 as compared to enzalutamide treatment alone. As seen below, the increases or decreases in gene expression with enzalutamide depicted by red and blue bars in the left column are generally the same in color and greater in intensity with the enzalutamide + CPI-1205 combination in the right column.

13


This corroborates our hypothesis that EZH2 functionally cooperates with androgen receptor signaling to promote prostate cancer growth. Preclinical studies have also found that the concentrations of the combinations of enzalutamide and CPI-1205 necessary to kill 90% of prostate cancer cells is much lower than that theoretically predicted if no synergistic activity occurred, as seen below.

We also believe that EZH2 is utilized by prostate cancer cells to establish resistance to ARS inhibitors. We have observed in preclinical studies that EZH2 inhibitors, such as CPI-1205, in combination with ARS inhibitors synergistically killed tumor cells and demonstrated activity in models that are resistant to ARS inhibitors. 
 Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer 
 According to the American Cancer Society, or ACS, prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer among men in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death in this population. In 2018, the ACS estimated that in the United States approximately 165,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer per year and that there will be approximately 29,000 deaths per year due to prostate cancer. 
 The growth and survival of prostate cancer cells depend primarily on the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Cancer cells can use the binding of androgens to androgen receptors to trigger abnormal cell growth and tumor progression. The standard of care for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, which induces medical castration or surgical castration to achieve reduced testosterone levels. Medical castration involves gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, alone or in combination with first-generation anti-androgen therapy. Most men with prostate cancer treated with ADT respond, as measured by tumor regression, relief of symptoms, and reductions in serum prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, levels and are considered to have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. However, almost all prostate cancer patients eventually experience a recurrence in tumor growth despite ADT. These patients are diagnosed with castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC, which refers to prostate cancer that progresses despite ADT and is characterized by low serum testosterone levels. The development of CRPC following ADT is due in part to tumor cells that adapt to the hormone-deprived environment of the prostate. 
 Castration-resistant prostate cancer that spreads, or metastasizes, to other parts of the body is diagnosed as mCRPC and may be characterized by increasing PSA levels, elevated CTC counts, bone metastases, and soft tissue disease. CTCs are cells that have been shed from a primary tumor and are carried around the body in the blood and may lead to metastases. According to a meta-analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials published in a peer-reviewed third-party scientific publication, elevated CTC counts have been demonstrated to be an indicator of poor prognosis for overall survival in patients with mCRPC. According to the published analysis, a 30% decline in CTC counts as early as four weeks after treatment initiation suggests that advanced prostate cancer patients may benefit from treatment. 
 Patients with mCRPC have an average survival of approximately 30 months and experience a deterioration in quality of life despite treatment with the available therapeutic options. The standard practice is to treat mCRPC with an ARS inhibitor, including abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. These products are approved in the United States for first-line therapy in chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC as well as for second-line treatment in patients who have received prior chemotherapy. 
 14


We believe that there are approximately 140,000 men in the United States living with castration-resistant prostate cancer and that the majority of those patients will develop mCRPC. Based on third-party data, we estimate that there are approximately 30,000 to 50,000 new mCRPC patients per year in the United States. Most patients progress from earlier prostate cancer stages, while some patients are initially diagnosed with metastatic disease. We believe that most patients with mCRPC receive treatment with at least one ARS inhibitor. According to published literature, approximately 60-80% of patients with mCRPC respond to first-line treatment with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, with nine to 15 months of PSA progression-free survival. Of those who have a PSA response, a large majority eventually develop resistance to ARS inhibitors. Resistance mechanisms to ARS inhibitors include AR amplification and overexpression and circulating androgen receptor splice variant-7, or ARV7, which is a constitutively active version of the AR that is no longer inhibited by ARS inhibitors. ARV7 is a marker for aggressive mCRPC. 
 If patients with mCRPC have disease progression after treatment with an ARS inhibitor, they may be treated with either chemotherapy or a different ARS inhibitor. Experts that treat mCRPC patients estimated that only 10-30% of patients will respond to the second-line treatment with a different ARS inhibitor and that the response achieved is typically less than half as durable, with two to three months of PSA progression-free survival, as compared to the response observed with first-line ARS inhibitor treatment. These estimates have recently been corroborated by the Chi study at ASCO in 2018. After treatment and progression with a second ARS inhibitor or chemotherapy, patients with mCRPC have very limited treatment options other than pain management and other palliative care options. We believe patients who have received either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide as a first- or second-line therapy would be candidates for combination therapy with these therapies and CPI-1205. 
 Clinical Development 
 ProSTAR Trial: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial in Combination with ARS Inhibitors. We are currently conducting an open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CPI-1205 in combination with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC who had previously progressed on treatment with the other ARS inhibitor. The design of the ProSTAR trial is depicted below. 


In the Phase 1b portion of the trial, 36 mCRPC patients were treated with CPI-1205 in combination with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Patients who experienced disease progression on treatment with abiraterone acetate were treated with a combination of enzalutamide and CPI-1205, and patients who experienced disease progression on treatment with enzalutamide were treated with a combination of abiraterone acetate and CPI-1205. The Phase 1b portion of this trial established the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, maximum tolerated dose, and a recommended Phase 2 dose of CPI-1205 with these agents. The Phase 1b portion of the trial also observed evidence of clinical activity in both arms and in each of the parameters measured—PSA reductions, CTC reductions, and objective responses by RECIST. We intend to present data from the Phase 1b portion of the trial at the AACR meeting on April 1, 2019.
 
In the Phase 1b portion of ProSTAR as of February 6, 2019, the enzalutamide + CPI-1205 combination and the abiraterone acetate + CPI-1205 combination were both generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects were diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea of mild severity. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported.  One patient treated with the combination of CPI-1205 and abiraterone acetate discontinued treatment prior to completing one cycle (28 days) due to elevated liver enzymes, or transaminases. The elevated transaminases were asymptomatic and reversible. This patient also had clinical disease progression. No other dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One patient treated with the combination of CPI-1205, abiraterone acetate, and a co-medication that inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 involved in drug metabolism had evidence of progression and died due to complications of pneumonia after two cycles of treatment in the trial. The clinical investigator concluded that the fatal event was not related to treatment with the trial combination. 
 15


Based on preliminary results in the enzalutamide arm of the Phase 1b portion of ProSTAR, we initiated dosing in a randomized Phase 2 portion evaluating CPI-1205 in combination with enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone. While we previously planned to test CPI-1205 in combination with only one ARS inhibitor in the Phase 2 portion of the trial, based on promising data in the abiraterone acetate arm of the Phase 1b we decided to expand the Phase 2 portion of the study by adding an arm evaluating CPI-1205 in combination with abiraterone acetate in mCRPC patients who progressed on prior enzalutamide therapy. This arm will not be randomized against a control arm due to the low response rate and lack of durability seen with abiraterone acetate in the second-line setting. We have initiated dosing in both the enzalutamide arms and the abiraterone acetate arm. We also plan to collect and analyze biomarkers to assess molecular features of AR- and EZH2-related biology, which may allow us to enrich for patients who are most likely to respond to treatment with CPI-1205. Enrollment is on track in the Phase 2 portion of this trial. We intend to present an interim update of data of the Phase 2 portion of the ProSTAR trial at a medical meeting in the second half of 2019.
 Compassionate Use. Two patients have been treated with a combination of CPI-1205 and enzalutamide under a compassionate-use protocol based on the preliminary anti-tumor activity observed in our Phase 1b clinical trial and because these patients did not meet the eligibility criteria for the ProSTAR trial. The first patient’s cancer previously progressed on treatment with both abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide as well as multiple chemotherapy treatments, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, treatment with a tyrosine kinase enzyme inhibitor, and radium regimens. Shortly after first dosing with CPI-1205 and enzalutamide, treatment was interrupted for approximately four days due to non-treatment-associated pneumonia. Based on an assessment taken two weeks after initiation of therapy, this patient was observed to have an 80% reduction in PSA levels and showed evidence of tumor size reduction in the neck by palpation. Subsequently, the patient was found to have progressive disease in the liver, stopped therapy, and died shortly thereafter due to disease progression. The second patient was heavily pretreated with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and docetaxel. This patient stopped chemotherapy without evidence of progressive disease and began treatment with CPI-1205 and enzalutamide, rendering us unable to evaluate the results of treatment. This patient discontinued the experimental combination due to disease progression. Based on the encouraging results in the first patient, we initiated an expansion arm in the ProSTAR trial of up to 30 heavily pretreated patients to determine whether the combination of CPI-1205 and enzalutamide could provide them with a meaningful benefit. 
ORIOn-E Trial: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. We initiated ORIOn-E, a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CPI-1205 in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with solid tumors who have previously progressed on treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor that inhibits programmed death-ligand 1, (PD-L1), or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Similar to the ProSTAR trial, patients were given an 800 mg dose of CPI-1205 three times per day, and we also explored the use of the same co-medication mentioned above to boost the exposure and lower the dose of CPI-1205 in this trial. The primary endpoint of the Phase 1b trial was to establish the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose of CPI-1205 with these agents. We assessed any dose-limiting toxicities according to CTCAE.
 As of February 6, 2019, 24 patients in the Phase 1b trial had been treated with CPI-1205, consisting of 12 patients treated with the combination of CPI-1205 and ipilimumab and 12 patients treated with the combination of CPI-1205 and pembrolizumab. We observed preliminary evidence of activity. Three patients reported treatment-related serious adverse events, as follow: One patient experienced nausea and vomiting that resolved after treatment. Two patients experienced autoimmune hepatitis / transaminase elevations, including one taking the ipilimumab + CPI-1205 combination and one taking the pembrolizumab + CPI-1205 combination. Both cases had complete resolution of transaminases after steroid treatment. In addition, 14 patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression, consisting of seven patients taking the ipilimumab + CPI-1205 combination and seven patients taking the pembrolizumab + CPI-1205 combination. 
 In the second half of 2018, we decided not to proceed with the Phase 2 portion of ORIOn-E. The decision was based on prioritization to focus on CPI-1205 development efforts in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and on other priorities. We may consider exploring combinations of CPI-1205 with checkpoint inhibitors as part of a broader clinical development strategy in the future.
 Phase 1 Monotherapy Studies. We have evaluated CPI-1205 as monotherapy in a Phase 1 clinical trial in 32 patients with progressive / relapsed lymphoma, including 22 patients in the dose-escalation portion of the trial and ten patients in the expansion portion of the trial. We evaluated escalating doses of CPI-1205 administered on a continuous twice-daily dosing basis. Patients in the dose-escalation portion of the trial received CPI-1205 doses of 200, 400, 800, and 1,600 mg. The primary endpoint of the trial was to establish the safety of CPI-1205 as a single agent by evaluating the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities associated with treatment with CPI-1205 during the first 28 days of treatment. CPI-1205 was well tolerated at all dose levels with no dose-limiting toxicities reported during the dose-escalation phase. The most frequent adverse events in the Phase 1 trial were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, a decrease in lymphocyte count, and muscle spasms, which were mostly grade 1 and grade 2. The most common study drug-related event experienced was diarrhea, which was reported by 
 16


nine (28.1%) patients, followed by nausea reported by eight (25.0%) patients and fatigue by four (12.5%) patients. These events were mainly mild in severity and manageable with adequate supportive care. Only 5 (15.6%) patients had study-drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, of Grade 3 or higher. Decreased lymphocyte count was the only drug-related TEAE, with severity of Grade 3 or higher reported by more than two patients. At least one serious TEAE was reported by 15 (46.9%) patients. There were two possibly treatment-related serious adverse events, consisting of nausea and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The secondary endpoints of the trial were to characterize the safety and tolerability of CPI-1205, the pharmacokinetics of CPI-1205, the pharmacodynamic effects of CPI-1205 in lymphoma biopsy tissue, bone marrow, and skin biopsy tissue, and circulating subsets of normal immune cells and any anti-lymphoma activity that may be associated with CPI-1205
 Patients in the dose-escalation portion of the trial were not selected on the basis of an EZH2 mutation. We observed dose-dependent increases in CPI-1205 exposure and evidence of target engagement at multiple dose levels. As of January 2018, two of the lymphoma patients treated with CPI-1205 as a monotherapy had objective partial metabolic responses to treatment by independent central review under the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Lugano criteria, and one patient had durable stable disease. Under the Lugano criteria, responses are assessed using a PET/CT scan and are scored on a five-point scale. A partial metabolic response has a score of four or five with reduced tumor glucose uptake and suggests responding disease at interim and residual disease at end of treatment. Stable disease has a score of four or five with no significant change in tumor glucose uptake from baseline at interim or end of treatment. Both patients with partial metabolic responses were enrolled in the 1,600 mg cohort, one with germinal center-B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one with follicular lymphoma. Both patients had progressive reductions in tumor volume. In addition, as of May 25, 2018, one patient with small lymphocytic lymphoma enrolled in the 200 mg cohort who remained on treatment has had stable disease for more than 32 treatment cycles. This patient transitioned to a single patient IND. The patient discontinued treatment and had stable disease in her last assessment.
 We made a strategic decision to prioritize development of CPI-1205 in solid tumors, despite encouraging clinical data in our Phase 1 trial in patients with refractory lymphoma, primarily due to our evaluation of the potential pathway to regulatory approval and the potential commercial opportunities in solid tumors. 
 Preclinical Studies. We have conducted preclinical studies using in vitro prostate cancer cell models in which our observations suggested that CPI-1205 affected the viability of androgen-receptor-dependent prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These results were achieved consistently throughout the preclinical studies using in vitro prostate cancer cell models. We also observed that CPI-1205 affected the viability of two different established prostate cancer cell models of ARS inhibitor resistance: cell models that expressed ARV7 and cell models with engineered overexpression of the androgen receptor, which are resistant to bicalutamide, an ARS inhibitor. In addition, we observed that CPI-1205 enhanced the activity of ARS inhibitors in androgen-receptor-dependent prostate cancer cell models. We observed synergy with each combination of CPI-1205 and enzalutamide and of CPI-1205 and abiraterone acetate, and we believe that each agent enhanced the activity of the other agent. 
 As shown below, we observed that CPI-1205 inhibited tumor growth in vivo as a single agent in a lymphoma xenograft mouse model and may enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies, including ARS inhibitors in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model and immune checkpoint inhibitors in a breast cancer mouse model.

The results in the lymphoma xenograft model presented above are consistent with similar studies of CPI-1205 as a monotherapy in that and other lymphoma xenograft models. The lymphoma xenograft model was powered for statistical significance. We used a conventional method of assessing statistical significance known as a one-way analysis of variance, or ANOVA, and the p-value for this study was less than 0.0001. p-value is a conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of experimental results. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. We have not conducted additional studies in the other two models presented above. These two models were not powered for statistical significance. 
 
We also conducted additional preclinical studies of CPI-1205 in models of tumor types other than those discussed above. Depending on the tumor type, we observed varied levels of tumor growth inhibition at a given CPI-1205 dosing regimen, and the results of those studies helped inform our clinical development strategy. 
 CPI-0209—Second-Generation EZH2 Inhibitor 
 We designed CPI-0209, our second-generation EZH2 inhibitor, to achieve comprehensive coverage of EZH2 to potentially enable rapid and durable tumor regression. We believe that such a product would enable us to expand the addressable patient populations beyond those that have been targeted by first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. We are currently advancing CPI-0209 in IND-enabling studies and plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors in mid-2019.
 In preclinical studies, we observed that CPI-0209 bound to EZH2 more durably and with higher affinity when compared to first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. We believe that these characteristics may enable CPI-0209 to increase the level and duration of EZH2 inhibition compared to that of CPI-1205. Product candidates that provide more comprehensive and longer inhibition of EZH2 may treat certain cancer types requiring that effect. We believe that the level of EZH2 inhibition necessary to produce a therapeutic effect varies across cancer types based on our preclinical studies where we have observed that the dose required to affect tumor growth is higher in certain cancer types. As illustrated below, we have also observed that CPI-0209 produced tumor regression beginning after five days of initiation of treatment in a lymphoma xenograft mouse model. In an ARV7+ prostate cancer model, a disease type for which ARS inhibitors have not been found to be effective, we observed that CPI-0209 stopped tumor growth after 21 days of treatment. Based on this, we hypothesize that CPI-0209 can potentially be effective in other tumor models where first-generation EZH2 inhibitors would be less effective.
 Rapid and Durable Tumor Regression in Lymphoma Xenograft Mutated EZH2 Model (left) and Prostate Cancer Xenograft ARV7+ Model (right)



We plan to develop CPI-0209 for the treatment of solid tumors. We believe that mutations can render these tumor cells dependent on the activity of EZH2 and that cancer cells can use EZH2 as a resistance mechanism against therapeutic agents. We are considering developing CPI-0209 in one or more of these contexts. 
Discovery Programs 
 We are currently advancing several programs against additional epigenetic regulators focused on the tumor and the immune microenvironment. Our immuno-epigenetics efforts are focused on pathways relevant for immune cell re-programming or increasing tumor immunogenicity to drive tumor rejection. We remain committed to advancing programs that normalize abnormal cell gene expression within cancer cells.

Sales and Marketing 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States with our own focused specialty sales force. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We have entered into clinical supply agreements with contract manufacturers. 
 We obtain materials for CPI-1205 and CPI-0610 from multiple third-party manufacturers. We engage separate third-party manufacturers for the finish-and-fill services for CPI-1205 and CPI-0610. For CPI-0209, we have engaged a third-party manufacturer to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient and another third-party manufacturer for the finish-and-fill services. 
 All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapies that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms, including through EZH2 and BET inhibition. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical testing, regulatory review, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, and enrolling patients in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and price, the availability and effectiveness of related companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we can enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 19


The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation, and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies our product candidates will not compete with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients, and third-party payers. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 CPI-0610 / Myelofibrosis 
 Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor developed and marketed by Incyte, was approved by the FDA in 2011 as a first-line treatment for high- and intermediate-risk myelofibrosis patients. There are no products approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities outside the United States as a second-line treatment for patients who no longer respond to or tolerate treatment with ruxolitinib. Many companies are developing product candidates or combination regimens that may compete with CPI-0610, if approved, as a combination regimen with ruxolitinib or as monotherapy in patients who have received prior ruxolitinib therapy. 
 Incyte is developing treatments for second-line therapy in patients with MF that combine ruxolitinib with PI3 kinase inhibitors and provirus integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus kinase inhibitors. Incyte may develop these combinations in a co-formulated oral dosage form, which could increase the convenience of these combination regimens.
 There are several other companies developing JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors as a first-line and second-line treatment of patients with MF. Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, acquired fedratinib in January 2018 as part of its acquisition of Impact Biosciences, Inc. In January 2019, Bristol-Myers Squibb proposed acquiring Celgene. Fedratinib has been evaluated in clinical trials as first- and second-line treatments for MF. Celgene has disclosed that an NDA was filed for regulatory approval of fedratinib in myelofibrosis at the end of 2018. Celgene has also disclosed the potential to combine fedratinib with other products, such as the erythroid maturation agent luspatercept. CTI Biopharma Corp. is conducting a Phase 3 trial of pacritinib in MF patients with thrombocytopenia in the United States. Nippon Shinyaku is conducting a Phase 2 trial with NS-018 in patients with MF. Sierra Oncology is developing momelotinib, a JAK1/ACVR1 inhibitor for MF and associated anemia. 
 CPI-0610 could face competition from products with different biological targets that are in development as a therapeutic option for patients with MF with prior exposure to ruxolitinib, including as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib. These products include kinase inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, and other epigenetic inhibitors. Geron Corporation is conducting a Phase 2 trial evaluating imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, in patients with MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Imago BioSciences, Inc., is conducting a Phase 1 trial of IMG-7289 with an inhibitor of LSD1, which is an epigenetic target, in patients with MF. MEI Pharma, Inc., and Helsinn are conducting a Phase 2 trial of pracinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor in MF patients on treatment with ruxolitinib. 
 We are aware of several companies that are developing BET inhibitors, including AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, GlaxoSmithKline, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, or Roche, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, SignalRx and Zenith Epigenetics. 
 CPI-1205 / mCRPC 
 CPI-1205 could face competition from ARS inhibitors, chemotherapies, and products with alternative mechanisms. Competing ARS inhibitors include enzalutamide (Xtandi®), which is marketed by Pfizer and Astellas, and abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®), which is marketed by Janssen. In February 2018, the FDA approved apalutamide (Erleada®), an ARS inhibitor developed by Janssen for the treatment of non-metastatic CRPC, a disease state when the cancer no longer responds to medical or surgical treatments that lower testosterone but has not yet been discovered in other parts of the body. In late 2018, generic versions of abiraterone acetate were launched. Bayer is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials with darolutamide, an ARS inhibitor in non-metastatic CRPC and in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Additionally, each of these products is a potential alternative for CPI-1205-based combination therapy for patients whose disease has progressed after initial treatment with an ARS inhibitor. 
 20


Janssen received regulatory approval for abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy in hormone-naïve metastatic prostate cancer in February 2018. Pfizer and Astellas completed a Phase 3 trial with enzalutamide in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and the FDA granted Priority Review of a Supplemental New Drug Application based on these data in March 2018. Bayer reported in February 2019 the successful completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial with darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
 Competing chemotherapies include docetaxel (Taxotere), cabazitaxel (Jevtana), and sipuleucel-T (Provenge), which each provide an option for patients who may not wish to continue treatment with an ARS inhibitor. Product candidates targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) include the radioligand Lu-177-PSMA-617 (Endocyte, acquired in 2019 by Novartis), AMG160 (Amgen), and HPN424 (Harpoon).
 CPI-1205 may also face competition from products with alternative mechanisms of action including poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors, targeted therapies including polo-like kinase inhibitors and protein kinase B, or AKT, inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapy-based mechanisms. Several companies are conducting clinical development of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer, including AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, Pfizer, AbbVie and Janssen/Tesaro (Glaxo SmithKline acquired Tesaro in 2019).
 CPI-1205 could also face competition from products targeting similar or alternative epigenetic mechanisms. Zenith Epigenetics and GlaxoSmithKline are each testing BET inhibitors (ZEN-3694 and GSK 525762, respectively) in Phase 1 trials in patients with mCRPC. Pfizer initiated clinical development of an EZH2 inhibitor, PF-06821497, in a Phase 1b/2 trial that includes a combination arm with enzalutamide in mCRPC. Jiangsu HengRui is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SHR2554, an EZH2 inhibitor, alone or in combination with SHR3680, an androgen receptor antagonist, in mCRPC. CellCentric. is developing CCS1477, a P300/CBP inhibitor, and is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials in prostate cancer. Epizyme, Inc. is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of tazemetostat, an EZH2 inhibitor, in solid tumors and hematological malignancies and has announced plans to develop the compound in prostate cancer. Merck is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, enzalutamide, and olaparib in prostate cancer.
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of epigenetic small molecule drug discovery. 
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. Moreover, other than for CPI-1205 and CPI-0610, we have generally not sought, and may be unable to obtain, patent protection for certain of our product candidates generally as well as with respect to certain indications. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications directed to our key programs, including CPI-1205, CPI-0209 and CPI-0610, in an effort to establish our intellectual property positions regarding new compositions relating to these programs as well as uses of these and similar compositions in the treatment of relevant diseases. We also seek patent protection with respect to methods of making these compositions and to biomarkers that may be useful in establishing or monitoring the efficacy of these compositions in patients. As of January 17, 2019, we owned 19 issued or allowed U.S. patents, six U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications, one pending reissue application (which has now been allowed), 141 issued or allowed foreign patents, 20 foreign pending patent applications, 10 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application and seven U.S. provisional patent applications. The foreign issued patents and patent applications are in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa for CPI-1205 and including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa for CPI-0610. Additionally, our epigenetics platform is not protected by any patented intellectual property. 
 21


The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced programs as of January 17, 2019, are summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO can be significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this could be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below. 
 CPI-0610 / BET Inhibitor Program 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our CPI-0610 program includes patents and applications directed to compositions of matter generically and specifically covering CPI-0610 and related BET inhibitors, as well as to methods for using and making these novel compositions. As of January 17, 2019, we owned three issued or allowed U.S. patents, two issued or allowed European Patent Office patents, and approximately 57 foreign patents and patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions relating to our CPI-0610 program. The U.S. or ex-U.S. issued patents or patents issuing from these pending applications, if any, for our CPI-0610 program are projected to have a statutory expiration date from December 2031 to June 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. CPI-1205 / EZH2 Inhibitor Program 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our CPI-1205 program includes patents and applications directed to compositions of matter generically and specifically covering CPI-1205 and related EZH2 inhibitors, as well as to methods for using and making these novel compositions. As of January 17, 2019, we owned five issued or allowed U.S. patents, two issued or allowed European Patent Office patents, five U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications, one pending U.S. reissue application (which has been now allowed), approximately 80 foreign patents and patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, and six pending PCT applications relating to our CPI-1205 program. Of our owned U.S. patents, three are issued U.S. composition of matter patents that contain claims covering CPI-1205 specifically and generically. We are aware of prior art that may invalidate some but not all of the generic claims included in one of the composition of matter patents. While we believe that the specific claims and the other generic claims contained in our issued U.S. composition of matter patents provide protection for the composition of matter of CPI-1205 and are not implicated by such prior art, third parties may nevertheless challenge such claims and if such specific claims, or any such other generic claims on which we may rely, are invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason, we will lose valuable intellectual property rights and our ability to prevent others from competing with us would be impaired. The U.S.- or ex-U.S.-issued patents or patents issuing from these pending applications, if any, for our CPI-1205 program are projected to have statutory expiration dates between February 2033 and December 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 
CPI-0209 / Second-Generation EZH2 Inhibitor Program 
 We own one pending U.S. provisional patent application covering the composition of matter and methods of use of CPI-0209. However, we do not currently own or in-license any issued patents or non-provisional patent applications covering our CPI-0209 product candidate. Our provisional patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the provisional application. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent application and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent application, we cannot predict whether any of our future patent applications for CPI-0209 or any other future product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect CPI-0209 and any other future product candidates, or if any of our or our licensors’ issued patents will effectively 
 22


prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we and our licensors cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our licensed patents, patents we own in the future, or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. 
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 License and Collaboration Agreement with Genentech 
 In January 2012, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genentech, Inc., and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, collectively referred to as Genentech. We refer to this agreement as the collaboration agreement. Our performance obligations under the collaboration agreement are complete. 
 Under the collaboration agreement, we and Genentech conducted a three-year research collaboration program to discover and validate certain epigenetic targets, or the Targets, and to discover and develop compounds suitable for clinical development that bind to and modulate those Targets. Genentech had the right to obtain the exclusive right to develop product candidates that target certain of the Targets. We refer to any such licensed product as a Genentech Licensed Product. In December 2014, Genentech selected three Targets and acquired such exclusive rights with respect to these Targets. In August 2018, Genentech terminated its exclusive rights to two of the three selected Targets. Following this termination, we have been conducting and are permitted to conduct research and development activities with respect to those two Targets. We refer to the remaining Target for which Genentech holds exclusive rights as the Genentech Target. The Genentech Target is not currently a target that is part of our clinical, preclinical or discovery programs. Genentech is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one product for the Genentech Target. 
 Under the collaboration agreement, we granted an exclusive, sublicensable license to Genentech under certain of our intellectual property to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, research, discover and develop the Genentech Target and certain compounds and products that bind to and modulate the Genentech Target. We refer to this license as the Genentech Target License. We also granted Genentech a non-exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property in order for Genentech to make, use and import compounds created during the research collaboration or provided by us to Genentech during the research collaboration, for Genentech’s internal research purposes relating to biological targets that are not Targets. 
 Genentech paid us $40 million as an upfront payment under the collaboration agreement and provided additional funds for our research activities under the research collaboration. With respect to the Genentech Target, the collaboration agreement provides for milestone payments and future sales-based milestones and royalties payable to us by Genentech upon achievement of specified milestones and sales targets by Genentech. Specifically, for the first Genentech Licensed Product to achieve a milestone for the Genentech Target, Genentech has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $208 million for certain preclinical and clinical milestones, regulatory approval and sales milestones, and certain other sales milestones if the Genentech Licensed Product is covered by a valid claim of an issued patent in certain of our intellectual property. To date, Genentech has paid us $0.8 million for the achievement of a preclinical milestone with respect to one Genentech Target. We did not receive any milestone payments or royalties in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 Genentech is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties ranging from mid-single-digit to low-teen percentages on net sales of Genentech Licensed Products if covered by a valid claim of an issued patent in certain of our intellectual property in the country of sale, and a low-single digit royalty on net sales of Genentech Licensed Products if covered only by certain pending patent applications in certain of our intellectual property in the country of sale. These royalties are subject to reduction or elimination in certain circumstances. Genentech’s royalty obligations continue on a Genentech Licensed Product on a country-by-country basis until, as applicable, (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the Genentech Licensed Product in the country of sale if the Genentech Licensed Product is covered by a valid issued claim of a license patent,  or (ii) , the date on which the Genentech Licensed Product is no longer covered by such a pending licensed patent application in the country of sale, if the Genentech Licensed Product is covered only by a valid pending claim of a licensed patent application. Based on the current status of the licensed patents and patent applications, any such payments are not likely to extend beyond May 2037. Following Genentech’s termination of its exclusive rights to two of the three selected Targets in August 2018, we are obligated to pay Genentech a low-single-digit royalty on net sales of any licensed products we develop that target such terminated Targets and are covered by a valid issued claim in the intellectual property jointly developed by us and Genentech during the research collaboration. 
 23


The collaboration agreement will expire when all the payment obligations under the collaboration agreement expire. We and Genentech may each terminate the collaboration agreement in whole or with respect to a country for a Genentech Target or a Genentech Licensed Product if the other party materially breaches the collaboration agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified time period. Genentech may terminate the collaboration agreement for convenience in whole or with respect to a country for a Genentech Target or Genentech Licensed Product on 90 days’ prior written notice. We and Genentech may each terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party undergoes certain bankruptcy events. If Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement as a whole or with respect to a Genentech Target, Genentech Licensed Product or country for our uncured material breach or bankruptcy event, the licenses we granted to Genentech would become irrevocable and, instead of paying the milestones and royalties described above, Genentech would pay us a low-single-digit royalty on net sales of the Genentech Licensed Products with respect to which the collaboration agreement was terminated if such Genentech Licensed Products are covered by a valid claim of an issued patent in certain of our intellectual property in the terminated countries, which royalties are subject to reduction or elimination in certain circumstances. 
 In January 2012, we entered into an option agreement with Genentech under which we granted Genentech an option to acquire all of our equity interests. In August 2015, Genentech notified us that it elected not to exercise the option, and the option is no longer exercisable. 
 Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 
 In July 2012, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, or LLS. We refer to the agreement as the LLS Agreement. Under the LLS Agreement, LLS agreed to provide funding for the development of a compound targeted toward certain tandem bromodomain-containing proteins, designed for and researched for use in the treatment of lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia or multiple myeloma, or the Field, in accordance with an agreed-upon budget and milestones, which we call the research program. The LLS Agreement initially required us to perform the development activities on a compound that we are no longer developing. We and LLS amended the LLS Agreement in April 2013 to allow us to propose alternative compounds to LLS and for LLS to decide whether it would fund the research program for an alternative compound. We proposed CPI-0610, and LLS agreed to fund CPI-0610 as the alternative compound in June 2013. We and LLS further amended the LLS Agreement in June 2013, June 2014 and March 2016 to reflect changes to the research program milestones. 
 LLS has agreed to pay us up to $7.5 million, or the LLS Funding, toward the costs of the research program. We may use such funding solely to pay or reimburse expenses of the research program in accordance with an agreed-upon budget. As of December 31, 2018, LLS has paid us $7.3 million in aggregate, and we expect that the milestones which would trigger the remaining $0.2 million will be achieved in 2019. We are obligated, and have to date provided funding, to match LLS’s funding to support the research program. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research program substantially in accordance with an agreed-upon research plan with the goal of developing an LLS Product for commercial sale. Once the research program is complete, we are obligated to use, at our own expense, commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one LLS Product in the Field in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom or Japan, or the major market countries, and, following receipt of regulatory approval for at least one LLS Product in any major market country, to commercialize the LLS Product in the Field in such country. If we fail to meet the foregoing obligation, then, under certain circumstances, LLS may terminate the agreement and LLS may exercise the exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license we granted LLS in certain of our intellectual property to develop and commercialize CPI-0610. 
 We are obligated to pay to LLS up to $25 million, which would be payable in variable portions based on our execution of any agreement to license or permanently transfer rights to CPI-0610 or an LLS Product to an unaffiliated third party, on the closing of a change of control of our company, or on the receipt of regulatory approval in certain of the major market countries, which we refer to as the Payment Cap Payments. Our payment obligations to LLS continue until satisfied and otherwise only terminate upon a termination of the LLS Agreement by us in the event of a material breach by LLS. The LLS Agreement expires when there are no longer any payment obligations owing from one party to the other with respect to any of these provisions. 
 We and LLS may terminate the LLS agreement for a material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified period. LLS may terminate the LLS Agreement if we are debarred by the FDA or excluded from health care programs, or if we knowingly use for any services under the LLS Agreement any individual or entity who is debarred or excluded, or if we undergo certain bankruptcy events. If LLS terminates the LLS Agreement because we are debarred by the FDA or excluded from health care programs, or knowingly use the services of any individual or entity who is debarred or excluded for any services under the LLS Agreement, or we materially breach the LLS Agreement and do not cure within the specified time period, we are obligated to repay LLS the LLS Funding and, if we continue development of the LLS Product thereafter, we also must pay LLS the Payment Cap Payments.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other government entities, including state agencies. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA: 
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage, including in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity and long-term toxicity studies may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In these cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC).  A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not be allowed to proceed, while other protocols may be allowed. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical trial may only resume after the FDA has so notified the sponsor. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the clinical trial can proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 26


Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive environment. 
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect.  This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 27


Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population. 
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug. Such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under Accelerated Approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies.  They must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan. 
 28


The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product. 
 Review and Approval of an NDA 
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new non-biologic drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Biologic Licensing Applications, of BLAs, are submitted for approval of biologic products. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation, an exception from the program fee when the program does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application, generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt, and strives to inform the sponsor within 74 days whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for Priority Review are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is being or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 29


In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. A REMS uses risk-minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, the seriousness of the disease, the expected benefit of the product, the expected duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that review, evaluate and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but the FDA considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interaction with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information, and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time-period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for Priority Review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A Priority Review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as Regenerative Advanced Therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for Priority Review and Accelerated Approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 30


Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant Accelerated Approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant Accelerated Approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted Accelerated Approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of Accelerated Approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with Accelerated Approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support Accelerated Approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The Accelerated Approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, Accelerated Approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of Accelerated Approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with Priority Review. 
 The Accelerated Approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including a REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS programs can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. The FDA may require a REMS before or after approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, changing manufacturing processes and adding labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 31


Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 32


In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies, which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength and conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or the patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 33


The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
 The FDA must establish a Priority Review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The FDA is also authorized to expedite review of “competitor generic therapies” or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, the expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

FDA Approval of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product.  In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.  Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate.  The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling.  PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs fees for medical device product review; for federal fiscal year 2019, the standard fee for review of a PMA is $322,147and the small business fee is $80,537.
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
 Health Care Law and Regulation 
 Health care providers and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payers and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 36


 
• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing •or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payers, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. 
 37


The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. 
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% (and 70% starting January 1, 2019) point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 38


Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session. 
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
 Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. 
 For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices.  Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will: take steps to end the
 gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.  More recently, on January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations.
 39


At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Specifically, however, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual member states of the European Union, or EU Member States, govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, was adopted. The Clinical Trials Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply later in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and replacing any national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.

PRIME Designation in the EU 
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e. the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization.

The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
  
• | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.

Regulatory Data Protection in the EU 
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Paediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 43


Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 

• | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and are also subject to EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty, which would be March 29, 2019. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. See “Risk factors—Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.” 
 The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the European Union. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the European Union, then it is expected the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption.

General Data Protection Regulation
 
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater.  The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Pricing Decisions for Approved Products 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, EU Member States have the option to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
