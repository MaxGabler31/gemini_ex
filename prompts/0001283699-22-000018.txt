Business Overview and Strategy
Un-carrier Strategy
We are America’s supercharged Un-carrier. Through our Un-carrier strategy, we have disrupted the wireless communications services industry, by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, including providing them with added value, an exceptional experience and implementing signature Un-carrier initiatives that have changed wireless for good. We ended annual service contracts, overages, unpredictable international roaming fees, data buckets and so much more. We are inspired by a relentless customer experience focus, consistently leading the wireless industry in customer care by delivering award-winning customer experience with our “Team of Experts,” which drives our record-high customer satisfaction levels while enabling operational efficiencies.
As the Un-carrier, we are on a mission to build America’s best 5G network, offering customers unrivalled coverage and capacity where they live, work and play. Our network is the foundation of our success and powers everything we do. We are leveraging our mid-band spectrum licenses, including 1700 MHz Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”), 1900 MHz Personal Communications Services (“PCS”) and 2.5 GHz, our millimeter-wave licenses and our foundational layer of low-band spectrum, including 600 MHz, 700 MHz and 800 MHz, to create a “layer cake” of spectrum to provide an unmatched 5G experience to our customers. We believe this layer cake will broaden and deepen our nationwide 5G network enabling accelerated innovation and increased competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. As a result of the Merger, we have achieved and expect to continue to achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within our network as well as other business processes and operations.
We continue to expand the footprint and improve the quality of our network, providing outstanding wireless experiences for customers who will not have to compromise on quality and value. Going forward, it is this network that will allow us to deliver new, innovative products and services with the same customer experience focus and industry-disrupting mentality that has redefined the wireless communications services industry in the United States in the customers’ favor. 
Our Operations
As of December 31, 2021, we provide wireless services to 108.7 million postpaid and prepaid customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communications services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses relate to operating and expanding our network, providing a full range of devices, acquiring and retaining high-quality customers and compensating employees. We provide services, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.t-mobile.com and www.metrobyt-mobile.com), T-Mobile app, customer care channels and through national retailers. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.
Services and Products
We provide wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers. 
Our primary service plan offering, which allows customers to subscribe for wireless communications services separately from the purchase of a device, is our signature Magenta plan (“Magenta”), which includes, among other benefits, unlimited talk, text and smartphone data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features and more. Customers also have the ability to choose additional features, such as unlimited premium data with our Ultra Capacity 5G service, for an additional cost on our Magenta Max plan. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics, as well as specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Unlimited 55+, Military and Veterans, First Responder, and Business.

Our device options for qualifying customers include: 
•The option of financing all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an equipment installment plan (“EIP”); and
•The option to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it when eligibility requirements are met.
In addition to our wireless communications services, we offer fast and reliable High Speed Internet utilizing our nationwide network. Our fixed wireless High Speed Internet provides a real alternative to traditional landline internet service providers and expands access to many people who have historically had only one choice or no access to traditional home broadband. With our High Speed Internet plan, customers can access the internet without worrying about annual service contracts, data overages, startup costs or hidden fees. 
We also provide products and services that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection and wireline communication services to domestic and international customers.
Customers
We provide wireless communications services to two primary categories of customers: 
•Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, wearables, DIGITS (a service that allows our customers to use multiple mobile numbers on any compatible smartphone, wearable or other device with internet connection) or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products; and
•Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.
We provide Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship is managed by wholesale partners. 
We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2021, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:
•73% Postpaid customers;
•17% Prepaid customers; and 
•10% Wholesale and other services.
Substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Network Strategy
Utilizing our multi-layer spectrum portfolio, our mission is to be “Famous for Network.” We have deployed low-band and mid-band spectrum dedicated for 5G across our dense and broad network to create America’s largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. 
Our Merger with Sprint greatly enhanced our spectrum position. Integration of the spectrum and network assets acquired in the Merger is expected to occur through 2023. The integration strategy includes deploying the acquired spectrum on the combined network assets to supplement capacity, migrating Sprint customers to our network and optimizing the combined assets by decommissioning redundant sites to realize synergies.

•As of December 31, 2021, our Ultra Capacity 5G covers 210 million people and can deliver speeds of 400 Mbps or more.
•As of December 31, 2021, our Extended Range 5G covers 310 million people, reaching 94% of Americans.
Competition
The wireless communications services industry is highly competitive. We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, MVNOs, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing or offering bundled services as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video or music streaming services, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) have always been a part of the Un-carrier culture, and we are committed to having DE&I touch every aspect of our future. Our Equity in Action Plan is a five-year plan that spans the values we live by, how we invest in and provide opportunities for our employees, how we select the suppliers we do business with and how we advocate for our communities.
For our employees, we have established six DE&I Employee Resource Groups and four sub-affinity groups that have helped us establish and maintain a culture of inclusion. Currently, we have over 50 DE&I chapters across the nation that help spearhead volunteer opportunities, events and meaningful conversation with employees at a local level. Our DE&I networks include the following:

Table of Contents

◦Magenta Latinx Network;
•Multigenerational Network;
•Pride;
•Veterans & Allies Network; and
•Women & Allies Network. 
We have established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council in connection with our civil rights memorandum of understanding. The council includes civil rights leaders representing a wide-range of underrepresented communities. Together with T-Mobile, the council will help identify ways to improve our efforts in focus areas such as corporate governance, workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and community investment.
Environmental Sustainability
Reducing Carbon Footprint
We are working to do our part to combat climate change and preserve the environment by setting carbon reduction goals that are aligned with science and investing in renewable energy. We are reducing our carbon footprint through several initiatives, including:
•Setting science-based targets to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions;
•Investing in renewable energy, as evidenced by our RE100 pledge, a global initiative that unites businesses committed to 100% renewable energy. We met this goal in 2021 through credits and our engagement in Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements (VPPAs) and a Green Direct tariff agreement with nine clean energy providers for expected annual provision of approximately 3.4 million megawatt hours of renewable energy; 
•Continuously testing and evaluating new, efficient equipment for our facilities, including switch stations, cell sites, retail stores and customer experience centers to reduce energy consumption; and
•Promoting the circular economy through our device reuse and recycle program, which collects millions of devices for reuse, resale, and recycling annually.
Responsible Sourcing
We believe our suppliers are a valuable extension of our business and corporate values. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for our suppliers. We require our suppliers to operate in full compliance with laws, rules, regulations and ethical standards of the country in which they operate or provide products or services. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to ethical conduct and environmentally responsible business practices while they conduct business with or on behalf of us.
We employ a third-party risk management (“TPRM”) process to screen for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights and environmental risks before engaging with a supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks.
As DE&I is instrumental to our culture and values, we are on a mission to create fair and equitable opportunities for all suppliers, including veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned and small and disadvantaged businesses.
Regulation
The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating

results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. 
Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the FCC retains the right to modify rules related to use of licensed spectrum, which could impact T-Mobile’s ability to provide services.
Additionally, Congress’s and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. 
Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.
For our Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we primarily access EBS spectrum through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses but we continue to lease most of our spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time. The elimination of these restrictions will allow and may encourage current license holders to sell their licenses to other parties, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated.
While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, service mapping, protection of consumer information, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, in response to the Pandemic, several state legislatures are considering bills or have passed laws that could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards, and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.
In addition, following the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (“RIF”) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC’s RIF Order preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending.
Table of Contents

While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation, and Colorado and Virginia, which have passed privacy laws. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
