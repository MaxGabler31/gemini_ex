IN GENERAL
 We were incorporated on March 22, 2016 in the State of Nevada. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have made purchase of equipment and we rent our office in Cyprus. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.   
We are not a «shell company» within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we do have hard assets and real business operations.  
From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our sole officer and director, engaging in market research, rent of our office in Cyprus and entering into supply agreement. We received our initial funding of $2,000 from our sole officer and director who purchased 2,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share.   
We have a goods sales contract between Clancy Corp. and Afrodita Co, Freskada Co, Omorfiá Co., OloToSóma Co.

INITIAL FOCUS OF OUR BUSINESS
 We produce our product in Cyprus and we have signed a contract with Hodm Professionals Limited, based in China, and we are ordering from them our equipment and raw materials for handcrafted soap production. We are also considering other firms as well for this work. We decided to use natural ingredients as an alternative to the synthetic ingredients prevalent in personal care products today. We intend to establish formulations using fresh, pure, and safe ingredients that appeal to people.   
Our products are inspired by many growing trends. Most specifically consumers seeking new, intriguing formulations, which promote well-being either through the principles of natural therapy, or simply for the pleasure of natural aromas, which the product will bring. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness among consumers of the benefits in using organic and natural products. Unlike many other companies, our use of natural ingredients will not entail using a small portion of natural ingredients to tout the product as «natural». Our products are created to support optimal benefit to the users by containing ingredients that make a difference.  We plan to advertise through handcrafted soap trade shows and marketing campaign at the stores of our future customers, distributors and related. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase handcrafted soap from us. We will follow up with these clients periodically, send them our new catalogues and offer them special discounts from time to time. In future we plan to print flyers and mail them to potential customers. We intend to use marketing methods, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers

OUR PRODUCTS
 Brief History of Our Products
 Soap making history goes back many thousands years. The most basic supplies for soap making were those taken from animal and nature; many people made soap by mixing animal fats with lye. Today, soap is produce from fats and an alkali. The cold process method is the most popular soap making process today, while some soap makers use the historical hot process.  
In the early beginnings of soap making, it was an exclusive technique used by small groups of soap makers. Over time, recipes for soap making became more widely known. Back then, plant byproducts and animal and vegetable oils were the main ingredients of soap. The price of soap was significantly reduced in 1791 when a Frenchman by the name of LeBlanc discovered a chemical process that allowed soap to be sold for significantly less money.  
More than 20 years later, another Frenchman identified relationships between glycerin, fats and acid what marked the beginning of modern soap making. Since that time, there have been no major discoveries and the same processes are used for the soap making we use and enjoy today.  
In the mid-nineteenth century, soap for bathing became a separate commodity from laundry soap, with milder soaps being packaged, sold and made available for personal use. Liquid hand soaps were invented in the 1970s and this invention keeps soaps in the public view.  
Types of Handcrafted Soap
 While the chemical reaction that creates soap is always the same, different types of soaps can be made by different methods, all still relying upon that basic chemical reaction that occurs.  Cold Process Soap
 Cold process soap making is the method most often used by soap makers who make soap from scratch. It is called «cold» process because no additional heat is added during the soap making process; however the process itself does generate heat.   
Handcrafted soap makers generally pride themselves on their unique recipes, developed to create their signature soaps. Soap ingredients are usually food-quality, natural ingredients starting with a variety of vegetable oils such as olive, coconut, or palm, or purified tallow or lard. To these the soap maker might add specialized oils, nut butters or seed extracts to bring the desired qualities to the finished bar.  
Soaps produced via the cold process method are opaque and usually have a creamy feel to the bar. Without any additives that change the color, the soap ranges from white-white to creamy-tan, depending on the oils used in making the soap.  
The feel of the lather varies, also dependent upon the oils used to make the soap. The lather can range from tiny, very slippery, long-lasting bubbles (as with pure olive oil soap), to big, fluffy, short-lived bubbles (as with pure coconut oil soap).  
The hardness of the bar is determined by the selection of oils, the amount of water used and how long the soap was dried. Cold process soaps will continue to get harder as they age because additional water evaporates out of the soap.  
Most cold process soaps are made with a combination of oils, in a recipe developed by the soap maker to create a good lather and hard bar, as well as to provide benefits with additional ingredients.  
Hot Process Soap
 In hot process soap making, additional heat is applied to the soap mixture. The chemical reaction is the same, but occurs faster than in cold process soap making. Because of the additional heat, the finished soap bar tends to feel smoother to the touch. The hardness of the bar again depends on the selection of oils, amount of water used in the process and length of time allowed for water to evaporate out of the finished bar.

As with cold process soap, the hot process soap is opaque and ranges from white-white to creamy-tan depending on the oils used, although clear soaps can be produced (see «Transparent Soap» below).  
The oils determine the type and quality of the lather and other benefits of the soap and other ingredients selected to make the soap.  
Transparent Soap
 Transparent Soap is made by the hot process method, with some added ingredients and steps in the process to make the soap clear. There are a few highly skilled handcrafted soap makers who produce transparent soap from scratch, but a majority of handcrafted transparent soaps on the market are produced from a ready-made soap base.  «Glycerin» Soap
 Glycerin is a by-product of the chemical reaction of the soap making process. In commercial soaps, the glycerin is typically removed, purified and then sold for other uses including food, cosmetics, various industrial production and explosive manufacturing. The method for removing the glycerin from soap is complex and requires considerable equipment and skill. As a result, all handcrafted soaps made from scratch retain the glycerin (and all its beneficial properties) and so are all technically «glycerin soap».  
Subsequently, the term «glycerin soap» is somewhat of a misnomer. Most people using the term «glycerin soap» are, in fact, referring to transparent soap.  
Ready-Made Soap Bases
 Rather than make soap from scratch, some soap makers choose to purchase ready-made soap bases which are melted down, have color, scent or other ingredients added and are then poured into molds.  
The benefit to using a ready-made soap base is that the chemical reaction which produces soap has already occurred, making it easier for the handcrafter to craft elegantly and uniquely shaped and colored soaps. Many of the artistic presentations of handcrafted soap can only be created with a ready-made soap base.  
A ready-made soap base may be a «true soap» (made via the chemical reaction referred to above) or could include synthetic detergents as all or a portion of its ingredients.  
There are some basic recipes we used for production our handcrafted soap:  
Development, Production and Distribution 
 Our officer and director, Iryna Kologrim, has developed a number of handcrafted soap products, based in part on the above ingredients, using a unique blend of different raw materials. We consider these formulations unique; however, we have no patents pending for our formulations. Our products, while largely formulated with the base of unique ingredients, are still in the development phase. We are currently in the process of finalizing our product formulations.  We intend to sample each finalized product and complete the process of choosing all the peripheral items involved in the production and marketing process, including: the shape and size of the product containers; the types of caps; the packaging; the logo and label designs; and unit cartons. We intend to use Hodm Professionals Limited to handle our packaging design. In prestige markets, more than any other, the package is the product. We are in negotiations with Hodm Professionals Limited for various pricing and decorative options for product presentation.  
We are planning to develop our online store for distribution the soap. We are in the process of defining the launch schedule and the promotional events that will surround it. We expect our products to be available on the website once we start our significant operations and obtain customers, although a definitive launch date has yet to be determined.  Following our online launch, we intend to locate and negotiate with distributors to develop additional channels for our product.  
COMPETITION
 Among all the brands found in this industry, we consider our closest competitors to be Vegenero and Trifillaris is a natural line that reflects our product concept and closely resembles our proposed product line. The concept and creation of the Vegenero and Trifillaris product line, like ours, is an extrapolation on the benefits of the antioxidants, polyphenols, and organic and natural ingredients. The advantage of Vegenero and Trifillaris over our proposed product in the marketplace at this time is twofold: (a) they have been on the market for over a decade and have grown to be a global brand with distribution outlets all over the world; and (b) they serve a larger target audience with a lower price point than we anticipate.   
The prime difference between Vegenero or Trifillaris and our proposed product line is expected to be based on the market segment and Certified Organic quality of ingredients that will be included in our products. Therefore, the containers are key to our products' success as well. Further, our brand will use only the highest quality USDA Certified Organic ingredients available, including extracts, producing a highly concentrated preparation of antioxidant polyphenols. We are also using our own uniquely innovative raw materials derived from Certified Organic farmers in China, to process as opposed to only using commercially available raw materials. Our product line will also be packaged in high quality containers with inviting labels, versus the lesser quality plastic tubes and bottles used by Hodm Professionals Limited. We believe these same characteristics, Certified Organic, quality ingredients, and decorative containers, will also help us stand out in the prestige market.
