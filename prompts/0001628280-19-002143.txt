ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
We operate in three complementary business segments: Operating Assets, MPCs and Strategic Developments. The combination of these three segments provides both operational and financial synergies. The vast majority of the assets in our Operating Assets segment are located within our MPCs. This helps us achieve scale and, in most cases, critical mass, which leads to pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations; increased ability to attract, hire and retain the best local leadership and leasing teams; flexibility to meet changing customer demands; and enhanced ability to identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In our MPC segment, we plan, develop and manage small cities in markets with strong long-term growth fundamentals. This business involves the horizontal development of residential land and selling the improved acreage to homebuilders for the eventual sale of homes to new residents. Combined, our MPCs span over 80,000 gross acres, with approximately 7,200 residential acres of land remaining to be developed and sold in high demand geographic areas. In addition to the residential land, our MPC segment contains nearly 3,400 acres designated for commercial development or sale to non-competing users such as hospitals. This land is held in our MPC segment until we identify demand for a new commercial development, at which point the land is transitioned into our Strategic Developments segment. 
The operational synergies of combining our three business segments create a unique and continuous value-creation cycle. We sell land to residential homebuilders in our MPCs, and the new homes attract residents to our cities looking for places to work and shop. New homeowners create demand for commercial developments, such as retail, office, self-storage and hospitality offerings. We build these commercial properties through Strategic Developments when the timing is right using the cash flow harvested from the sale of land to homebuilders, which helps mitigate development risk. Once these strategic developments are completed and stabilized, they transition to Operating Assets and increase recurring NOI, further funding the equity requirements in Strategic Developments. New office, retail and other commercial amenities make our MPC residential land more appealing to homebuyers and increase the velocity of land sales at premiums that exceed the broader market. Increased demand for residential land generates more cash flow from our MPCs, thus continuing the cycle. We are headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and our assets are located across the United States. We were incorporated in Delaware in 2010. Through our predecessors, we have been in business for several decades. Financial information about each of our segments is presented in Note 17 - Segments of our audited Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and highlights of our segments are included below.
Operating Assets

• | 65 assets, including our investments in joint ventures and other assets, consisting of 15 retail, 28 office, eight multi-family, four hospitality properties and 10 other operating assets and investments.


• | We own approximately 7.3 million square feet of retail and office, 2,351 multi-family units and 975 rooms in our hospitality assets.

MPCs

• | We own the MPCs of Summerlin in Las Vegas; The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland in Houston; and Columbia in Maryland.


• | Our MPCs encompass over 80,000 gross acres of land and include approximately 10,543 remaining saleable acres of land.

Strategic Developments

• | Consists of 29 development or redevelopment projects.


• | As of December 31, 2018, total project costs are estimated to be $3.5 billion, of which $1.7 billion has already been spent.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other real estate companies through the following competitive strengths:

• | Management Team with Track Record of Value Creation. We have completed the development of over 4.6 million square feet of office and retail operating properties, 1,937 multi-family units and 909 hospitality keys since 2011. Excluding land which we own, we have invested approximately $1.8 billion in these developments, which is projected to generate a 9.6% yield on cost, or $170.0 million per year of NOI upon stabilization. At today’s market cap rates, this implies value creation to our shareholders of roughly $1.0 billion. Our investment of approximately $369.6 million of cash equity in our development projects since inception, which is computed as total costs excluding land less the related construction debt, is projected to generate a 25.2% return on cash equity assuming a 5.5% cost of debt, which approximates our historical cost. These investments and returns exclude condominium development as well as projects under construction such as the Seaport District. We exclude condominium developments since they do not result in recurring NOI, and we exclude projects under development due to the wider range of NOI they are expected to generate upon stabilization. In Ward Village, we have either opened or have under construction 2,129 condominium units, which have approximately 91.8% units sold as of December 31, 2018 at a targeted profit margin, excluding land costs, of approximately 29% or $726 million. 


• | Unique, Diverse Portfolio. We own a portfolio with many diverse market leading assets located across 12 states with a combination of steady cash flow and longer term value creation opportunities. 


• | Significant Value Creation Opportunity. We own one of the preeminent development pipelines in the world with over 50.0 million square feet of vertical entitlements remaining across our portfolio. This represents approximately 11 times the 4.6 million square feet we have delivered in the last eight years without having to acquire another development site or external asset, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage over other real estate development corporations. 


• | Low Leverage, Flexible Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt equaled approximately 43.2% of the book value of our total assets, which we believe is significantly less than the market value. Our net debt, which includes our share of debt of Real Estate and Other Affiliates less cash and Special Improvement District (“SID”) and Municipal Utility Districts (“MUD”) receivables, equaled approximately 35% of our total enterprise value. “Real Estate and Other Affiliates” refers to partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the development and operation of real estate assets. We finished the year with approximately $499.7 million of cash on hand. We have focused our efforts on obtaining non-recourse debt for both our construction financing and long-term fixed rate mortgage financing and have limited cross-collateralization for construction financing. Our low leverage, with a focus on project specific financing, provides substantial insulation against potential downturns and provides us with the flexibility to evaluate new real estate project opportunities. 


• | Self-Funded Business Plan. One of our key differentiators is our ability to self-fund significant portions of our new development without having to dispose of our recently completed developments or raise additional equity. Our residential land sales, recurring NOI and profits on the sales of condominium units generate substantial amounts of free cash flow which is used to fund the equity required to execute our many development opportunities. Furthermore, we are not required to pay dividends and are not restricted from investing in any asset type, amenity or service, providing further flexibility as compared to many other real estate companies which are limited in their activities because they have elected to be taxed as real estate investment trusts (“REIT”). We believe our structure currently provides significant financial and operating flexibility to maximize the value of our real estate portfolio. 

Overview of Business Segments
The following further describes our three business segments and provides a general description of the assets comprising these segments. This section should be referred to when reading “Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” which contains information about our financial results and operating performance for our business segments.

Operating Assets
We have developed many of the assets in our Operating Assets segment since the Company’s inception in 2010. Revenue is primarily generated through rental and hospitality services and is directly impacted by trends in rental and occupancy rates and operating costs. We will also occasionally sell an operating asset when it does not complement our existing properties or no longer fits within our current strategy. We believe that the long-term value of our Operating Assets is driven by their concentration in our MPCs where we have a unique level of control and competitive advantage. We believe these assets have the potential for future growth by increasing rental rates, absorbing remaining vacancy and changing the tenant mix in retail centers to improve gross sales revenue of our tenants, thereby increasing rents.
For certain assets, we believe there are opportunities to improve operating performance through redevelopment or repositioning. Redevelopment plans for these assets may include office, retail or residential space, shopping centers, movie theaters, parking complexes or open space. The redevelopment plans may require that we obtain permits, licenses, consents and/or waivers from various parties. These opportunities will require new capital investment and vary in complexity and scale. The redevelopment opportunities range from those that would have minimal disruption to the property to those requiring partial or full demolition of existing structures for new construction. Factors we evaluate in determining whether to redevelop or reposition an asset include the following: (1) existing and forecasted demographics surrounding the property; (2) competition related to existing and/or alternative uses; (3) existing entitlements of the property and our ability to change them; (4) compatibility of the physical site with proposed uses; and (5) environmental considerations, traffic patterns and access to the properties.
We generally transfer an operating asset that is being repositioned or redeveloped into our Strategic Developments segment when we close operations at a property and/or begin construction on the redevelopment project. Upon completion of construction or renovation of a development or redevelopment, the asset is fully or partially placed in service and transferred back into our Operating Assets segment.
Master Planned Communities
Our MPC segment includes the development and sale of residential and commercial land, primarily in large-scale, long-term projects. These developments often require decades of investment and continued focus on the changing market dynamics surrounding these communities. We believe that the long-term value of our MPCs remains strong because of their competitive positioning in their respective markets, our in-depth experience in diverse land use planning and the fact that we have substantially completed the entitlement processes within the majority of our communities.
Our MPCs have won numerous awards for design excellence and for community contribution. Summerlin was recently ranked by RCLCO as the third highest selling master planned community, with Bridgeland also ranking 18th and The Woodlands ranking 42nd in the country for 2018. Downtown Summerlin was also recognized with a Placemaking Award from the Urban Land Institute and several neighborhoods in Summerlin earned Silver Nugget Awards from the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association. Bridgeland was recognized by the Texas Association of Builders as Developer of the Year for 2018, and The Woodlands was named Trailblazer of the Year by the Greater Houston Builders Association.
We expect the competitive position, desirable locations and land development expertise to drive the long-term growth of our MPCs. As of December 31, 2018, our MPCs include 10,543 remaining saleable acres of land. Residential sales, which are generated primarily from the sale of finished lots and undeveloped superpads to residential homebuilders and developers, include standard and custom parcels designated for detached and attached single family homes, and range from entry-level to luxury homes. Superpad sites are generally 20 to 25-acre parcels of unimproved land where we develop and construct the major utilities (water, sewer and storm drainage) and roads to the borders of the parcel and the homebuilder completes the on-site utilities, roads and finished lots. Revenue is also generated through price participation with homebuilders.
We also occasionally sell or lease land for commercial development when we deem its use will not compete with our existing properties or our development strategy. Commercial sales include land parcels designated for retail, office, hospitality, high density residential projects (e.g., condominiums and apartments), services and other for-profit activities, as well as those parcels designated for use by government, schools and other not-for-profit entities.
Strategic Developments
Our Strategic Developments segment consists of 29 development or redevelopment projects, most of which require extensive planning and expertise in large-scale and long-range development to maximize their highest and best uses. The strategic process is complex and unique to each asset and requires on-going assessment of the changing market dynamics prior to the commencement of construction. We must study each local market, determine the highest and best use of the land and necessary improvements to 
4

the area, obtain entitlements and permits, complete architectural design and construction drawings, secure tenant commitments and obtain and commit sources of capital.
We are in various stages of predevelopment or execution of our strategic plans for many of these assets based on market conditions. As of December 31, 2018, we had 13 properties under construction and not yet placed into service. Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent on our properties under construction as of December 31, 2018, are $1.7 billion, of which $0.7 billion remains to be funded by us and the remaining amounts will be funded with existing debt. We generally obtain construction financing to fund a majority of the costs associated with developing these assets. Furthermore, we are always undergoing processes to obtain the required permits for our large scale real estate developments.

Competition
The nature and extent of our competition depends on the type of property involved. With respect to our Operating Assets segment, we primarily compete for retail and office tenants, residential tenants and hospitality guests. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include: (1) consumer demographics; (2) age, quality, design and location of properties; (3) neighboring real estate projects that have been developed or that we, or others, may develop in the future; (4) diversity of retailers and anchor tenants at shopping center locations; (5) management and operational expertise; and (6) rental rates. The principal factors influencing tenant leasing decisions for our office space include: (1) rental rates; (2) attractive views; (3) walkable retail; (4) commute time; (5) efficiency of space; and (6) demographics of available workforce. For residential tenants, we believe the factors that impact their decision of where to live are: (1) walkability/proximity to work; (2) amenities; and (3) the best value for their money. Our hospitality guests generally make decisions on which hotel they prefer based on: (1) the nature and intention of their trip; (2) brand loyalty; or (3) location and convenience to either an urban or open resort experience.
With respect to our MPC segment, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers primarily in the development of properties within Las Vegas, Nevada; the greater Houston, Texas area; and the Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. markets. Significant factors which we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include:

• | the size and scope of our MPCs;


• | years of experience serving and strong reputation within the industry;


• | the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities;


• | the commercial centers in the communities, including the properties that we own and/or operate or may develop;


• | our relationships with homebuilders;


• | our level of debt relative to total assets; and


• | the proximity of our developments to major metropolitan areas.

With respect to our Strategic Developments segment, our direct competitors include other commercial property developers, residential condominium developers and other owners of commercial real estate that engage in similar businesses. With significant existing entitlements, we hold an advantage over many of our competitors in our markets in that we already own and control, or have significant influence over, substantial acreage for development. We also own the majority of square feet of each product type in many of our markets.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to obtain financing using such real estate as collateral.
Substantially all of our properties have been subject to third-party Phase I environmental assessments, which are intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the surveyed and surrounding properties. As of December 31, 2018, the assessments have not revealed any known environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial position or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that these assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that the conditions have changed since the assessments were prepared (typically at the time the property was purchased 
7

or encumbered with debt). Moreover, no assurances can be given that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us, or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be adversely affected by tenants and occupants of the properties, by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties (such as the presence on such properties of underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us.
Future development opportunities may require additional capital and other expenditures to comply with federal, state and local statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In addition, there is a risk when redeveloping sites that we might encounter previously unknown issues that require remediation or residual contamination warranting special handling or disposal, which could affect the speed of redevelopment. Where redevelopment involves renovating or demolishing existing facilities, we may be required to undertake abatement and/or the removal and disposal of building materials or other remediation or cleanup activities that contain hazardous materials. We cannot predict with any certainty the magnitude of any such expenditures or the long-range effect, if any, on our operations. Compliance with such laws has not had a material adverse effect on our current or past operating results or competitive position, but could have such an effect on our operating results or competitive position in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,400 employees, approximately 550 of whom were employed at our hospitality properties.
