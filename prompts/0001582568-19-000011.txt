Overview
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed in February 2013 by subsidiaries of PBF Energy Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, PBF Logistics GP LLC (“PBF GP”), our general partner, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBF GP is our general partner and is wholly-owned by PBF Energy Company LLC (“PBF LLC”). PBF Energy Inc. is the sole managing member of PBF LLC and as of December 31, 2018 owned 99.0% of the total economic interest in PBF LLC. We refer you to “Organizational Structure” below for an illustration of our relationship with PBF Energy Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “PBF Energy” refer collectively to PBF Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, other than PBFX and its subsidiaries, and our general partner. PBFX’s common units trade on the NYSE under the symbol “PBFX,” and as of December 31, 2018, PBF LLC held a 44.0% limited partner interest in us, a non-economic general partner interest and owned all of the IDRs, with the remaining 56.0% limited partner interest held by public unitholders. On February 13, 2019, we entered into an Equity Restructuring Agreement (the “IDR Restructuring Agreement”) with PBF LLC and PBF GP, pursuant to which the IDRs held by PBF LLC will be canceled and converted into newly issued PBFX common units.

Our business includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of certain crude oil, refined products, natural gas and intermediates transportation, terminaling and storage assets, which include assets previously operated and owned by subsidiaries of PBF Holding Company LLC (“PBF Holding”) and PBF Holding’s previously held subsidiaries.
Business Developments
Knoxville Terminals Purchase
On April 16, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC (“PLPT”), completed the purchase of two refined product terminals located in Knoxville, Tennessee, which include product tanks with a total shell capacity of approximately 0.5 million barrels, pipeline connections to the Colonial Pipeline Company and Plantation Pipe Line Company pipeline systems and two truck loading facilities with nine loading bays (the “Knoxville Terminals”) from Cummins Terminals, Inc. (“Cummins”) for total cash consideration of $58.0 
4

million, excluding working capital adjustments (the “Knoxville Terminals Purchase”). The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, as defined below. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under GAAP. Refer to Note 4 “Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Knoxville Terminals Purchase.
East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition 
On July 16, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Crown Point International, LLC (“Crown Point”) to purchase its wholly-owned subsidiary, CPI Operations LLC (“CPI”), whose assets include a storage facility with approximately four million barrels of multi-use storage capacity, an Aframax-capable marine facility, a rail facility, a truck terminal, equipment, contracts and certain other idled assets located on the Delaware River near Paulsboro, New Jersey (the “East Coast Storage Assets”), for total consideration of $127.0 million, including working capital and the Contingent Consideration, as defined below (the “East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition”), comprised of an initial payment at closing of $75.0 million with a remaining balance of $32.0 million being payable one year after closing. Additionally, the East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition includes an earn-out provision related to an existing commercial agreement with a third party, based on the future results of restarting certain of the acquired idled assets (the “Contingent Consideration”). The acquisition date estimated fair value of the Contingent Consideration payable was $21.1 million. The East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition closed on October 1, 2018. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under GAAP. Refer to Note 4 “Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition and the Contingent Consideration. 
Registered Direct Offering
On July 16, 2018, we entered into a common unit purchase agreement with certain funds managed by Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. providing for the issuance and sale in a registered direct offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”) of an aggregate of 1,775,750 common units representing limited partner interests in us for gross proceeds of $35.0 million. The Registered Direct Offering closed on July 30, 2018. 
Development Assets Acquisition
On July 16, 2018, we entered into four contribution agreements with PBF LLC pursuant to which PBF Energy contributed to us certain of its subsidiaries (the “Development Assets Contribution Agreements”). Pursuant to the Development Assets Contribution Agreements, we acquired from PBF LLC all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Toledo Rail Logistics Company LLC (“TRLC”), whose assets consist of an unloading and loading rail facility located at PBF Holding’s Toledo Refinery (the “Toledo Rail Products Facility”); Chalmette Logistics Company LLC (“CLC”), whose assets consist of a truck loading rack facility (the “Chalmette Truck Rack”) and a rail yard facility (the “Chalmette Rosin Yard”), both of which are located at PBF Holding’s Chalmette Refinery; Paulsboro Terminaling Company LLC (“PTC”), whose assets consist of a lube oil terminal facility located at PBF Holding’s Paulsboro Refinery (the “Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal”); and DCR Storage and Loading Company LLC (“DSLC”), whose assets consist of an ethanol storage facility located at PBF Holding’s Delaware City Refinery (the “Delaware Ethanol Storage Facility” and collectively with the Toledo Rail Products Facility, the Chalmette Truck Rack, the Chalmette Rosin Yard and the Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal, the “Development Assets”). Total consideration for the acquisition of the Development Assets was $31.6 million, consisting of 1,494,134 common units representing limited partner interests in us issued to PBF LLC (the “Development Assets Acquisition”). The Development Assets Acquisition closed on July 31, 2018 and was accounted for as a transfer of assets between entities under common control under GAAP. Refer to Note 4 “Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Development Assets Acquisition.

Revolving Credit Facility 
On July 30, 2018, we entered into a $500.0 million amended and restated revolving credit facility (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility amended and restated our five-year $360.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in connection with the closing of the IPO. Among other things, the Revolving Credit Facility increased the maximum commitment available to us from $360.0 million to $500.0 million and extended the maturity date to July 2023. The commitment fees on the unused portion, the interest rate on advances and the fees for letters of credit are consistent with our original five-year, $360.0 million revolving credit facility. The Revolving Credit Facility contains representations, warranties and covenants by us, as well as customary events of default and indemnification obligations that are consistent with, or more favorable to us, than those in the original facility. Refer to Note 7 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Revolving Credit Facility.
IDR Restructuring Agreement
On February 13, 2019, we entered into the IDR Restructuring Agreement with PBF LLC and PBF GP, pursuant to which the IDRs held by PBF LLC will be canceled and converted into 10,000,000 newly issued PBFX common units (the “IDR Restructuring”). The IDR Restructuring is expected to close on February 28, 2019. Subsequent to the close of the IDR Restructuring, no distributions will be made to PBF LLC with respect to the IDRs and the newly issued common units will be entitled to normal distributions. 
Rail Agreement Amendments
On February 13, 2019, we amended the existing Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement between Delaware City Terminaling Company LLC and PBF Holding (as amended, the “Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement”) for the inclusion of services through certain rail infrastructure at the East Coast Storage Assets (the “East Coast Rail Assets”). We also entered into a new Terminaling Services Agreement, between Delaware City Terminaling Company and PBF Holding (the “Terminaling Services Agreement”), with a four-year term starting in 2022 subsequent to the expiration of the Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement, related to the DCR Rail Facility (as defined in the table below) and the East Coast Rail Assets, which will reduce the MVC to 95,000 bpd and includes additional services to be provided by us as operator of facilities owned by PBF Holding’s subsidiaries.
Principles of Combination and Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
In connection with, and subsequent to, the IPO, we have acquired certain assets from PBF LLC (collectively referred to as the “Contributed Assets”). Such acquisitions completed subsequent to the IPO were made through a series of drop-down transactions with PBF LLC (collectively referred to as the “Acquisitions from PBF”). The financial statements presented in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” in this Form 10-K include the consolidated financial results of PBF MLP Predecessor, our predecessor for accounting purposes (our “Predecessor”), for periods presented through May 13, 2014, and our consolidated financial results for the period beginning May 14, 2014, the date of the IPO. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 presents solely our consolidated financial position. We recorded the Acquisitions from PBF at PBF Energy’s historical book value, as the Acquisitions from PBF were treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information of us and our Predecessor contained herein to include the historical results of the Acquisitions from PBF prior to the effective date of each transaction with the exception of the Delaware Ethanol Storage Facility, which is considered an asset purchase. 
Our Predecessor did not historically operate its assets for the purpose of generating revenues independent of other PBF Energy businesses that we support, with the exception of the DCR Products Pipeline (as defined 
6

below) and the Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal. In connection with the closing of the IPO and each of the Acquisitions from PBF, we entered into commercial and service agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy under which we operate our assets for the purpose of generating fee-based revenues. We receive, handle and transfer crude oil, refined products and natural gas from sources located throughout the U.S. and Canada and store crude oil, refined products and intermediates for PBF Energy in support of its refineries. In addition, we generate third-party revenue from certain of our assets, including the Knoxville Terminals and the East Coast Storage Assets subsequent to our acquisitions in 2018 and the Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal, which also generated revenue for our Predecessor prior to our acquisition.
Since we do not own any of the crude oil, refined products or natural gas that we handle nor engage in the trading of crude oil, refined products or natural gas, we have minimal direct exposure to risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. However, these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term through their effects on our customer’s operations. A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from PBF Energy under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include MVCs. Refer to Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the commercial agreements with PBF Holding.
The Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of these income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account his, her or its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing his, her or its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and fair market value of PBFX’s assets, the acquisition price of such partner’s units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of PBF Logistics LP (as amended, our “partnership agreement”).

11

Commercial Agreements
We currently derive the majority of our revenue from long-term, fee-based, MVC agreements with PBF Holding, supported by contractual fee escalations for inflation adjustments and certain increases in operating costs. We believe the terms and conditions under these agreements, as well as the Omnibus Agreement (as defined below) and the Services Agreement (as defined below) each with PBF Holding, are generally no less favorable to either party than those that could have been negotiated with unaffiliated parties with respect to similar services. 
Refer to Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the commercial agreements with PBF Holding. 
Omnibus Agreement 
In addition to the commercial agreements described above, we have entered into an omnibus agreement with PBF GP, PBF LLC and PBF Holding, which has been amended and restated in connection with certain of the Acquisitions from PBF for the provision of executive management services and support for accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, environmental, health and safety, and other administrative functions, as well as (i) PBF LLC’s agreement not to compete with us under certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) our right of first offer for ten years to acquire certain logistics assets retained by PBF Energy following the IPO, including certain logistics assets that PBF LLC or its subsidiaries may construct or acquire in the future, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) a license to use our trademark and name.
On July 31, 2018, in connection with the Development Assets Acquisition, we entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (the “Omnibus Agreement”), with PBF GP, PBF LLC and PBF Holding, to update the provision of these executive management services and support for the Development Assets, which we expect to result in an increase of the estimated annual fee to $7.0 million. 
Services Agreement
Additionally, we have entered into an operation and management services and secondment agreement with PBF Holding and certain of its subsidiaries, pursuant to which PBF Holding and its subsidiaries provide us with the personnel necessary for us to perform our obligations under our commercial agreements. We reimburse PBF Holding for the use of such employees and the provision of certain infrastructure-related services to the extent applicable to our operations, including storm water discharge and waste water treatment, steam, potable water, access to certain roads and grounds, sanitary sewer access, electrical power, emergency response, filter press, fuel gas, API solids treatment, fire water and compressed air. 
On July 31, 2018, in connection with the Development Assets Acquisition, we entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Operation and Management Services and Secondment Agreement with PBF Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Services Agreement”) to update the provision of these operation and management services for the Development Assets, resulting in an increase of the annual fee to $8.6 million. The Services Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Omnibus Agreement, provided that we may terminate any service on 30-days’ notice.
Properties
Our principal properties are described above in “Assets and Operations.” We believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained. Our corporate office is located in the same office as PBF Energy. PBF Energy leases approximately 58,000 square feet for its principal corporate offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. The lease for PBF Energy’s principal corporate offices expires in 2022. Functions performed in the Parsippany office include overall corporate management, refinery and health, 
12

safety and environmental  management, planning and strategy, corporate finance, commercial operations, logistics, contract administration, marketing, investor relations, governmental affairs, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources support functions.
Additionally, we lease approximately 5,000 square feet for our regional corporate office in The Woodlands, Texas. The lease for The Woodlands office expires in 2022. Functions performed in The Woodlands include pipeline control center operations and logistics operations, engineering and regulatory support functions.
Under the Contribution Agreements, PBF Energy, through certain of its subsidiaries, indemnifies us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of the Contributed Assets arising at or before the closing of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. See “Environmental Regulations, Environmental Liabilities” below for a more detailed discussion of PBF Energy’s indemnification obligations.
Competition
As a result of our contractual relationship with PBF Energy and our direct connection to all of its refineries, we believe that our terminals, pipelines and storage facilities will not face significant competition from other terminals, pipelines and storage facilities for PBF Energy’s transportation and storage requirements with respect to the services provided under our commercial agreements.
If PBF Energy reduces its purchases of crude oil shipped via rail or truck, PBF Energy may only receive the minimum volumes through our crude oil unloading terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not receive the minimum volumes), which may cause a decrease in our revenues. PBF Energy may elect to ship crude oil to its refineries via pipeline or through its refinery marine facilities, which PBFX does not own, as an alternative mode of crude oil transportation. PBF Energy competes with integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil storage, supplies and distribution and marketing systems, as well as with independent refiners, many of which also have their own storage, distribution and marketing systems. PBF Energy also competes with other suppliers that purchase refined petroleum products for resale. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area and by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries.
The East Coast Terminals, the Knoxville Terminals and the East Coast Storage Assets compete with other terminal and storage facilities, in terms of fees, and other qualitative factors, including those affiliated with integrated petroleum companies. Competition related to the East Coast Terminals, the Knoxville Terminals and the East Coast Storage Assets is affected significantly by the volume of products produced, transported and available in the geographic area and the cost to transport products from distant locations.
Safety and Maintenance
We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our facilities and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets in accordance with good industry practices and as required by regulation.
Our terminal, pipeline and storage facilities have response plans, spill prevention and control plans, fire response plans, and other programs designed to effectively respond to emergencies. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste, and wastewater regulations.
Our pipelines are subject to strict safety laws and regulations for the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Transportation involves a risk that hazardous liquids or gases may be released into the environment, which could cause harm to the public or the environment. The DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of pipeline assets, which affect our pipelines. These regulations contain requirements for pipeline integrity management programs, 
13

which include the inspection, testing and maintenance or repairs of the pipelines. The DOT regulations also require pipeline operation and maintenance personnel to meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. We believe that we are in compliance with all of the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations on pipeline safety. 
Employee Safety
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state, and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
Insurance
Terminals and storage facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and/or are insured under the property, liability and business interruption policies of PBF Energy and/or certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits applicable to us, which we believe are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. As we continue to grow, we will continue to monitor limits and retentions under our policies and those of PBF Energy and/or its subsidiaries as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
Terminal and Pipeline Control Operations
Our terminals, facilities and pipelines are generally automated, but are continuously supervised by either our employees (including our employees located at The Woodlands office), or PBF Energy employees. At the terminals, our customers’ truck drivers are provided with security badges or other credentials to access and use these facilities. In addition, individual trucks are required to be registered in either our, or PBF Energy’s system to ensure that required regulatory inspections are maintained by either our customers, PBF Energy’s customers, or their common carriers.
Environmental Regulation
Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act restricts certain activities that may affect endangered species or their environments. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species or habitats could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating limitations or bans in the affected area.
Environmental Liabilities
Contaminations resulting from spills of crude oil or petroleum products are not unusual within the petroleum terminaling or transportation industries. Historic spills at truck and rail racks and terminals, as a result of past operations, have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater. 
14

Pursuant to the Contribution Agreements entered into in connection with the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF, PBF Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain known and unknown environmental liabilities that are based on conditions in existence at our Predecessor’s properties and associated with the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets and arising from the conditions that existed prior to the closings of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify PBF Energy for (i) certain events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets that occur, as applicable, after the closing of the each Acquisition from PBF (including the IPO), and (ii) environmental liabilities related to our assets if the environmental liability is the result of the negligence, willful misconduct or criminal conduct of us or our employees, including those seconded to us. As a result, we may incur environmental expenses in the future, which may be substantial.
In connection with the acquisition of the East Coast Terminals (the “Plains Asset Purchase”), we are responsible for the environmental remediation costs for conditions that existed on the closing date up to a maximum of $0.3 million per year for ten years, with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. remaining responsible for any and all additional costs above such amounts during such period.
In connection with the acquisition of the Toledo Products Terminal (the “Toledo Products Terminal Acquisition”), we did not assume, and are currently not aware of, any pre-existing environmental obligations. If pre-acquisition environmental obligations are identified, Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (“Sunoco”) is responsible for any liabilities up to $2.0 million identified to have occurred since 2002. For liabilities arising prior to 2002, Sunoco is indemnified by the prior owner under an agreement between Sunoco and the prior owner, and we are entitled to be reimbursed for all amounts paid related to such liabilities on a full pass-through basis. 
In connection with the Knoxville Terminals Purchase, we did not assume, and are currently not aware of, any pre-existing environmental obligations. Additionally, we and Cummins purchased a ten-year, $30.0 million environmental insurance policy against unknown environmental liabilities. For items not covered by the insurance policy, Cummins remains responsible for pre-acquisition environmental obligations up to $5.8 million.
In connection with the East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition, we assumed the pre-existing environmental obligations associated with the East Coast Storage Assets. Additionally, we and Crown Point purchased a ten-year, $30.0 million environmental insurance policy with a retention of not less than $0.5 million against unknown environmental liabilities. 
As of December 31, 2018, we have recorded a total liability related to environmental remediation costs of $2.6 million related to the acquisitions of the East Coast Terminals, the Torrance Valley Pipeline and the East Coast Storage Assets. Refer to Note 11 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Seasonality
The crude oil, refined products and natural gas throughput and stored at our facilities are affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil, refined products and natural gas in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets.
