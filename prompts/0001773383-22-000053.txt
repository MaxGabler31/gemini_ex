ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Digital transformation is ubiquitous, with software defining how we bank, manufacturer, deliver healthcare, receive government services, and communicate with our colleagues, friends, and families. This transformation is happening in dynamic hybrid, multicloud environments, which bring a scale and frequency of change that is exponentially greater than that of the old data-center world. 
Traditional approaches for developing, operating, monitoring, and securing software were not designed to keep pace with these modern cloud environments. What was once a well understood layering of applications running on operating systems on physical servers connected to physical networks has rapidly become virtualized into software at all levels. Applications are no longer monolithic and have become fragmented into thousands, potentially millions, of microservices, written in multiple software languages. These applications run in environments that extend across IaaS platforms, including Amazon Web Services, or AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, or GCP, and more traditional mainframe environments.
We believe the scale, complexity, and dynamic nature of modern hybrid, multicloud environments require a comprehensive observability, continuous runtime application security, and advanced AIOps strategy we refer to as software intelligence.
Dynatrace offers the market-leading software intelligence platform, purpose-built for dynamic hybrid, multicloud environments. As enterprises and public sector institutions embrace the cloud to effect their digital transformation, we designed our unified platform to address the growing complexity faced by IT, development, security, and business operations teams. The Dynatrace® platform combines comprehensive observability and continuous runtime application security with advanced AIOps to provide answers and intelligent automation from data, at enormous scale. This enables teams to modernize and automate cloud operations, deliver software faster and more securely, and ensure flawless digital experiences.
The Dynatrace platform provides the following key benefits:
•Single agent, fully automated configuration. Dynatrace® is installed as a single agent, OneAgent®, which automatically configures itself, and continuously discovers all components of the full stack to enable high fidelity data capture at enormous scale. OneAgent® dynamically profiles the performance of all components of the full stack with code-level precision, even as applications and environments update and change.
•Full-stack, all-in-one approach with deep cloud integrations. Dynatrace® combines Application and Microservices Monitoring, with Application Security, Infrastructure Monitoring, Digital Experience Management, Business Analytics, and Cloud Automation and in a single platform. We believe this all-in-one approach reduces the need for a variety of disparate tools and enables our customers to improve productivity and decision making while reducing operating costs. Dynatrace® provides out-of-the-box configuration for the leading cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu, and SAP, as well as coverage for traditional on-premises systems, including mainframe and monolithic applications in a single, easy-to-use, intelligent platform.
•AI-powered, answer-centric insights. Davis®, our proprietary AI engine, dynamically baselines the performance of all components in the full stack, continually learning normal performance thresholds to provide precise answers when performance deviates from expected or desired conditions. Unlike ML-based correlation engines that rely on historical data for learning behavior and overwhelm IT professionals with hundreds of alerts, Dynatrace® provides a single problem resolution and precise root-cause determination. We believe the accuracy and precision of the answers delivered by Davis® enable our customers to shift from reactive to proactive remediation, providing a substantial advantage in time savings, resource efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business outcomes.
•Enterprise scale. Dynatrace® utilizes big data architecture and enterprise-proven cloud technologies that are engineered for large, complex hybrid, multicloud environments. With role-based access and advanced security functionality, we built the Dynatrace platform for enterprise-wide adoption by the largest organizations in the world.
•Flexible deployment options. We deploy our platform as a SaaS solution, with the option of retaining the data in the cloud, or at the edge in customer-provisioned infrastructure, which we refer to as Dynatrace® Managed. This offering allows customers the flexibility to maintain control of the environment where their data resides, whether in the cloud or on-premises, combining the simplicity of SaaS with the ability to adhere to their own data security and sovereignty requirements. Our Mission Control center automatically upgrades all Dynatrace® instances and offers on-premises cluster customers auto-deployment options that suit their specific enterprise management processes.

In addition, we believe the ease of implementation for Dynatrace® provides us the opportunity to expand adoption within our existing enterprise customers, across new customer applications, and into additional business units or divisions. Once customers are on the Dynatrace® platform, we have seen significant dollar-based net expansion due to the ease of use and power of our new platform. Sustained a net expansion rate at or above 120% for the sixteenth consecutive quarter.
•Enhance our strategic partner ecosystem. Our strategic partners include industry-leading global system integrators, software vendors, and cloud and technology providers. We intend to continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on expanding our strategic alliances and cloud-focused partnerships with global system integrators, including Deloitte and DXC, and hyperscale cloud providers, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Red Hat.
The Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform
The Dynatrace® Software Intelligence Platform provides application and microservices monitoring (“APM”), runtime application security, infrastructure monitoring, digital experience monitoring (“DEM”), business analytics, and cloud automation in an easy-to-use, highly automated, all-in-one solution. We engineered the Dynatrace platform to automatically capture a wide variety of high-fidelity application, infrastructure, user experience, and open-source telemetry data at scale. With this broad set of observability data, the Dynatrace platform dynamically maps all components and their dependencies in a full-stack hybrid, multicloud environment for real-time, continuous context. Davis® processes this observability data in real time to deliver answers to issues, bottlenecks, degradations, and more. In addition, the Dynatrace platform provides extensive automation, including continuous discovery, proactive anomaly detection, and optimization across the software lifecycle. We believe this combination of unparalleled observability, runtime application security, and advanced AI and automation across hybrid, multicloud ecosystems enables our customers to modernize and automate cloud operations more efficiently, develop and release higher quality software faster, and ensure flawless digital experiences consistently.
Applications and Microservices Monitoring
Our approach to APM changes how our customers monitor applications and manage transactions across highly complex hybrid, multicloud environments. Because modern clouds are dynamic, Dynatrace instrumentation is automatic. Because cloud applications run on shared infrastructure and leverage shared services, Dynatrace monitors the full stack to provide visibility into distributed transactions and underlying code and entity relationships and dependencies. Dynatrace gathers metrics and telemetry beyond transaction data, including user experience, log and event data, and data from the latest open source standards, such as OpenTelemetry. Davis®, our AI engine, analyzes all data in the context of a continuously updated topology, Smartscape®. This combination of capabilities allows our customers to easily manage and optimize even the most complex cloud environments, with continuous observability and insights into cloud operations, software delivery pipelines, and business outcomes.
Application Security
Optimized for cloud-native applications, containers, and Kubernetes, Dynatrace® Application Security automatically and continuously detects vulnerabilities in applications, libraries, and code at runtime. It also provides real-time detection and blocking to protect against injection attacks that exploit critical vulnerabilities, such as Log4Shell. It removes blind spots and helps ensure development teams aren’t wasting time chasing false positives, and it provides the organizations with confidence in the security of their applications.

This coverage extends to the leading cloud platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VMWare Tanzu, Red Hat OpenShift, and Kubernetes, utilizing our OneAgent® instrumentation and powerful API ingestion capabilities to provide a single source of analysis across environments. 
Digital Experience Management
Dynatrace® Digital Experience Management integrates three user experience capabilities into one solution—Real User Monitoring (“RUM”), Synthetic Monitoring, and Session Replay. Dynatrace® RUM automatically captures every user click, tap, and swipe from any device across targeted applications and automatically connects these to back-end services for a complete picture of the user journey. Dynatrace® Synthetic Monitoring simulates user experience across production and development environments in internally built and third-party applications, such as Salesforce, Zoom, NetSuite, and ServiceNow, to provide a proactive view into applications’ and API performance and availability without the need for live users. Dynatrace® Session Replay delivers a movie-like review of a real user’s experience with an application, including what they saw and clicked on, how they converted, or where they abandoned the application. These insights enable digital teams to create more perfect user experiences. They also help align IT, developer, and business teams with a singular view and source of digital truth. 
Digital Business Analytics
Dynatrace® Digital Business Analytics leverages the data already flowing through the Dynatrace platform’s APM and DEM Modules and Davis®, the AI engine, to provide precise, real-time answers that enable teams to understand how the performance of their digital services affects critical KPIs, such as feature adoption, conversion, orders, release validation, customer segmentation, and app store ratings. These insights enable teams to continuously improve user experience and accelerate the delivery of digital innovation. 
Cloud Automation
Dynatrace® Cloud Automation leverages the observability and intelligence at the core of the Dynatrace platform and includes an embedded control plane to enable development, DevOps, and SRE teams to automate CI/CD, deployment, and release processes to accelerate release cycles, drive production reliability and meet business imperatives. Through shorter feedback loops between Dev and Ops teams and continuous release validation, DevOps and SRE teams can focus on delivering innovation faster and with less risk. 
Research and Development
We have a strong organic research and development (“R&D”) organization that is responsible for designing, developing, testing, and operating all aspects of our software intelligence offerings, including addressing new use cases, adding new innovative capabilities, extending the scale and scope of our technology, and embracing modern cloud and AI technologies while maintaining high quality.
We utilize an agile development process with 100% test automation to deliver approximately 25 major software releases per year and hundreds of minor releases, fixes and updates. We believe the full-stack monitoring required by dynamic multicloud environments requires a highly efficient and agile process to enable high-performing software across the diverse, dynamic cloud ecosystems of our customers.
