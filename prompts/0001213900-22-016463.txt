Competition

We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include pricing, user experience, brand, technological innovation, safety and reliability. We believe we compete favorably across these factors. We are strategically positioned in the Guangdong-Hong Kong market where the demand for traveling between these two places is high. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors— We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment



The Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment



Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors shall comply with the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalog, which was promulgated and is amended continuously by MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC. According to the Catalog, industries are classified as three categories: encouraged foreign invested industries, restricted foreign invested industries and prohibited foreign invested industries. Any industry not listed in the Catalog or any encouraged foreign invested industry listed in the Catalog is a permitted industry. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries within the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.



In June 2018, the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Administrative Measures for the Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List), or the Negative List (2018), effective in July 2018. The Negative List (2018) expands the scope of permitted industries by foreign investment by reducing the number of industries that fall within the Negative List (2018) where restrictions on the shareholding percentage or requirements on the composition of board or senior management still exists. In June 2019, the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Administrative Measures for the Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2019 Edition), or the Negative List (2019) to replace the Negative List (2018), effective in July 2019. The Negative List (2019) has reduced 8 special management measures in the Negative List (2018). We believe that our current business is to provide travel services and therefore falls in neither the Negative List (2018) nor the Negative List (2019).



Foreign Investment Law



On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which will become effective on January 1, 2020 and replace three existing laws on foreign investments in China, namely, the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Foreign Owned Enterprise Law, together with their implementations and ancillary regulations to become the legal foundation for foreign investment in the PRC.



According to the Foreign Investment Law, the State Council will publish or approve to publish a catalogue for special administrative measures, or the “negative list.” The Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign invested entities, except for those foreign invested entities that operate in industries deemed to be either “restricted” or “prohibited” in the “negative list.” Because the “negative list” has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current Negative List. The Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested entities operating in foreign restricted or prohibited industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC governmental authorities. Furthermore, the Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the Foreign Investment Law.



Interim Administrative Measures for the Record-filing of the Incorporation and Change of Foreign-invested Enterprises



On September 3, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the Order of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Amending Four Laws Including the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprises (the “Order”), which provides record-filing in lieu of administrative approval for the establishments and alterations of foreign invested enterprises (the “FIEs”) not subject to special administrative measures. In order to provide more guidance for foreign-invested Enterprises, the MOFCOM issued the Interim Administrative Measures for the Record-filing for the Establishment and Alteration of Foreign-invested Enterprises (the “Interim Measure”) on October 8, 2016 (Revised in July 30, 2017 and June 29, 2018), or the Measures. The Measures provided detail instructions for foreign-invested enterprise to carry out record filing in terms of the change of the enterprise in China.

The capital in Renminbi obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from the discretionary settlement of foreign exchange capital shall be managed under the account pending for foreign exchange settlement payment. The proportion of discretionary settlement of foreign exchange capital is temporarily determined as 100%, subject to the adjustment of the SAFE.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange Registration of Overseas Investment by PRC Residents



SAFE Circular 37 promulgated by the SAFE in July 2014, requires PRC residents or entities to register with the SAFE or its local branch their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of its basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term, and etc.) increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions, etc.



SAFE further enacted the Notice of the SAFE on Further Simplifying and Improving the Foreign Exchange Management Policies for Direct Investment, or the SAFE Notice 13, on February 13, 2015, which allows PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. However, remedial registration applications made by PRC residents that previously failed to comply with the SAFE Circular 37 will continue to fall under the jurisdiction of the relevant local branch of the SAFE. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from distributing profits to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. Further, the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary.

Regulations Relating to Employment and Social Insurance



Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law effective as of January 1, 1995 (as amended on August 27, 2009), and the PRC Labor Contract Law effective as of January 1, 2008 (as amended on December 28, 2012), a written labor contract shall be executed by employer and an employee when the employment relationship is established, and an employer is under an obligation to sign an unlimited- term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. In addition, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract must include an unlimited term, with certain exceptions. All employers are required to establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state rules and standards and provide employees with appropriate workplace safety training.

Regulations on Tax



PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law



On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Law of the PRC on Enterprise Income Tax, which was amended on February 24, 2017 and December 29, 2018, and on December 6, 2007, the State Council of the PRC enacted The Regulations for the Implementation of the Law on Enterprise Income Tax, or collectively, the EIT Law. According to the EIT Law, taxpayers consist of resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises are defined as enterprises that are established in China in accordance with PRC laws, or that are established in accordance with the laws of foreign countries but whose “de facto management body” is located in the PRC. Non-resident enterprises are defined as enterprises that are set up in accordance with the laws of foreign countries and whose de facto management body is located outside the PRC, but have either established institutions or premises in the PRC or have income generated from inside the PRC. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementing regulations, enterprises are subject to a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25%. However, if non-resident enterprises have not formed permanent establishments or premises in the PRC, or if they have formed permanent establishments or premises in the PRC but their relevant income derived in the PRC is not related to those establishments, then their enterprise income tax would be set at a rate of 10% for their income sourced from inside the PRC.



As noted, the EIT Law provides that an income tax rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends or other gains received by investors who are “non-resident enterprises” and who meet the requirements for the lower enterprise income tax rate. Such income tax on dividends may be reduced further by the tax treaties between China and the jurisdictions in which our non-PRC shareholders reside. Specifically, pursuant to an Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong enterprise (being the beneficial owner of dividends from a PRC enterprise) is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends that the Hong Kong enterprise receives from the PRC enterprise may be reduced to 5% subject to approval from the relevant tax authority. However, based on the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, or Notice No. 81, issued on February 20, 2009 by the State Tax Administration, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a corporate structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. Moreover, based on the Announcement on Certain Issues Concerning the Recognition of Beneficial Owners in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018 by the State Tax Administration, conduit companies, which are established for the purpose of evading or reducing tax, or transferring or accumulating profits, shall not be recognized as beneficial owners and are thus not entitled to the above tax benefits.



PRC Value-added Tax Law



The Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax were promulgated by the State Council of the PRC on December 13,1993 and subsequently amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016 and November 19, 2017. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) was promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the SAT on December 15, 2008 and subsequently amended on October 28, 2011 (collectively, the “VAT Law”). According to the VAT Law, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, provision of processing, repair and replacement services, and importation of goods within the territory of the PRC must pay value-added tax, or VAT. Other than exports (subject to 0% VAT rate) and certain products listed in the VAT Law (subject to 11% VAT rate), the sale and importation of goods were generally subject to a VAT rate of 17%. Pursuant to the Circular of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Adjusting Value-added Tax Rates, which became effective on May 1, 2018, the previous applicable VAT rate of 17% and 11% are adjusted to 16% and 10%, respectively.
