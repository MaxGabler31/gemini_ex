ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION 
STERIS is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention. WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal (“GI”) endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, dental instruments and tools, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing services, outsourced reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integration.
We operate our business and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences and Dental. Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company.
The bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.
On June 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding equity interests in Cantel Medical LLC ("Cantel") through a U.S. subsidiary. Cantel, formerly headquartered in Little Falls, New Jersey, with approximately 3,700 employees, is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental Customers. 
 We believe that the acquisition will strengthen STERIS’s leadership in infection prevention by bringing together two complementary businesses able to offer a broader set of Customers a more diversified selection of infection prevention, endoscopy and sterilization products and services. Cantel’s Dental business extends our business into a new Customer segment where there is an increasing focus on infection prevention protocols and processes. This business is reported as the Dental segment. The rest of Cantel was integrated into our existing Healthcare and Life Sciences segments. Additionally, the acquisition is expected to result in cost savings from optimizing global back-office infrastructure, leveraging best-demonstrated practices across locations and eliminating redundant public company costs.
We do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our operations, as we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our Customers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees, preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility. We have successfully managed our liquidity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to invest in expansion projects as planned. We obtained additional funding in the second half of fiscal 2021 to continue to advance our growth strategy to supplement organic growth with acquisitions. As a result, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic or the actions we took in response to the pandemic will negatively impact our long-term ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations. While we have been impacted and expect this situation to continue to have an impact on our business, we cannot predict the impact that another significant wave of disruption would have on our results of operations and financial position. For additional information and our risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to Part I Item 1A titled, "Risk Factors."

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.  We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and internationally. The principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, and plastic components. These raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities. However, in fiscal 2022 we have experienced delays in receiving materials and significant cost increases that we expect will continue in fiscal 2023. We do not currently expect any significant disruption to our operations due to sourcing problems in fiscal 2023. We have long-term supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers, or those that are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as ethylene oxide ("EO") and cobalt-60, which are necessary to our AST operations. In addition, we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies, which may reduce the potential supply risk. 
In response to the active conflict between Russian and Ukraine, we have stopped purchasing cobalt-60 from our Russian supplier. A long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from Russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our AST operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our AST segment and its results of operations. For additional information about the risks we face concerning the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, "Risk Factors."
Inflation. Historically, our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. However during fiscal 2022, we experienced a rise in supply chain and labor costs and anticipate continued supply chain and inflation pressure in fiscal 2023. We monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation.
Intellectual Property.  We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service, or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. 
We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
As of March 31, 2022, we held approximately 566 United States patents and approximately 2,346 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 188 United States patent applications and 428 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. The actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country.
Our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of March 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately 2,463 trademark registrations worldwide.
Quality Assurance.  We manufacture, assemble, and package products in several countries. Each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products. Our success depends upon Customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes. 
Government Regulation.  Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Government regulations require detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices.
Compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us. Past, current or future regulations, their interpretation, or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent, delay, revoke, or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations.
If we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, penalties could be imposed on us. For more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, "Risk Factors." We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value.
In the past, we have received warning letters, paid civil penalties, conducted product recalls and field corrections, and been subject to other regulatory penalties. We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance, results, or financial condition.
Environmental Matters.  We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in Ireland, the United States and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further information.
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition.
Competition.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support are important competitive factors to us. We expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. We believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. Also, a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.
We believe that our long-term competitive position depends on our success in discovering, developing, and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services. We devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe STERIS is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations. In addition to research and development, we invest in quality control, Customer training programs, distribution systems, technical services, and other information services.
There can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services, or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors. In addition, some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us. Therefore, a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do. Competition, as it relates to our business segments and product categories, is discussed in more detail in the section above titled, “Information Related to Business Segments.”
Methods of Distribution.  Sales and service activities are supported by a staff of regionally based clinical specialists, system planners, corporate account managers, and in-house Customer service and field support departments. We also contract with distributors and dealers.
Customer training is important to our business. We provide a variety of courses at Customer locations, at our training and education centers, and over the internet. Our training programs help Customers understand the science, technology, and operation of our products and services. Many of our operator training programs are approved by professional certifying organizations and offer continuing education credits to eligible course participants.
Seasonality.  Our financial results have been, from time to time, subject to seasonal patterns. We cannot assure you that these patterns will not continue.
Backlog.  We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. At March 31, 2022, we had a backlog, excluding Cantel, of $528.3 million. Of this amount, $423.6 million and $104.7 million related to our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, respectively. At March 31, 2021, we had backlog orders of $286.2 million. Of this amount, $206.3 million and $79.9 million related to our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, respectively. 
Availability of Securities and Exchange Commission Filings.  We make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). You may access these documents, as well as other SEC filings related to the Company, on the Investor Relations page of our website at http://www.steris-ir.com. You may also obtain copies of these documents by accessing the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The content on or accessible through any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
We also make available free of charge on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Director Code of Ethics, and our Code of Business Conduct, as well as the Charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Organization Development Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Compliance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE 
Introduction
 WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. Inspired by our Customers’ efforts to create a healthier and safer world, and guided by our legacy of leadership and innovation, we strive to be a Great Company. To STERIS, this means we will make a difference by providing world-class products and service solutions for our Customers, safe and rewarding work for our People, and superior returns for our Shareholders. 
We have an Enterprise Risk Management process ("ERM") to manage risk, which is led by our Chief Compliance Officer. Identifying and managing key risks to our business operations are essential to our future growth, profitability, and successful execution of strategic plans. We are committed to understanding and managing these risks through a consistent approach to risk assessment, monitoring, reporting, and mitigation. Key management sponsors are responsible for participating in the risk 
assessment process, including a periodic review with the Board of Directors. The objective of ERM is to identify key risks, the potential impacts of compliance failure, identify key mitigating activities, develop potential improvements for managing the risks, and to ensure execution of oversight activities on a monthly, annual or as needed basis. 
  We established a dedicated Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") function with the appointment of Vice President of ESG and are continuing to develop additional roles within the function. The ESG function, with support from our Chief Executive Officer, General Counsel and other senior executives, works to actively develop and refine our ESG strategies, programs, and policies. The ESG function works closely with our Global Sustainability Steering Committee to build ESG values and implement strategies, programs, and policies across the Company. The Global Sustainability Steering Committee is a cross-functional team of senior leadership, subcommittee chairs, and subject matter experts spanning our businesses and Legal, Investor Relations, Human Resources, Continuous Improvement, Compliance, Facilities, and Health, Safety and Environment functions. The ESG team regularly updates the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors.
Key performance indicators and metrics have been established for those areas we believe to be relevant and potentially significant to our business. Certain of these disclosures relate to Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards for Medical Equipment & Supplies that we have identified to be closely aligned with our business. Our reporting against the SASB Standards is a voluntary disclosure aligned with our focus on financial materiality. We seek to provide investors with useful, relevant and meaningful sustainability information and have selected metrics under the SASB Standards. We describe below how we continuously monitor and track our policies and activities in the areas of ethical business practices, energy and environmental conservation, employees and human capital management, and quality. 
ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
Code of Business Conduct. Our Code of Business Conduct sets the standard for legal and ethical behavior, addressing topics such as bribery and corruption, supply chain transparency, proper behavior in the workplace, and avoiding conflicts of interest. 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption. We are committed to conducting our business fairly, honorably, with integrity and in compliance with the law in all jurisdictions where we operate. Our policy prohibits bribery and corruption in any form, and we explain our commitment in our Statement on Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures. As an ongoing due diligence measure, we have established a program to recognize those sales and marketing intermediaries who demonstrate an elevated commitment to compliance. Through this Commercial Compliance Program, we formally recognize organizations that have not only met STERIS's standard ethical requirements for inclusion in our network but have also taken additional steps, such as adopting their own code of conduct and training their employees on their own firm's ethical values, to ensure compliant behavior.
In 2022, STERIS incurred no monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with bribery or corruption.
Supplier Code of Conduct. Our expectations for ethical behavior extend beyond STERIS to our Suppliers as well. Our Supplier Code of Conduct defines the minimum requirements and expectations for all Suppliers and their subcontractors. We have mechanisms in place to identify when suppliers do not meet our Supplier Code of Conduct requirements. Suspicions of supplier non-compliance are promptly investigated and addressed. We believe in conducting business with integrity and honesty and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. We expect our suppliers to comply with the laws of the countries in which they operate, including but not limited to the European Union Customs Code, the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the UK Modern Slavery Act, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, the US Dodd-Frank Conflict Minerals Rules, applicable data privacy laws, and all applicable local labor and employment laws. 
Conflict Minerals Sourcing Policy. We file reports with the SEC disclosing our use of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold ("conflict minerals" or "3TG") in products sold anywhere in the world. In accordance with these legal requirements and as a part of the overall commitment to responsible sourcing, we are working with our suppliers to ensure transparency to the smelter/refining source for 3TG materials used in our products. Furthermore, we seek to identify the countries of origin of the 3TG in our products and the smelter/refiners that process the 3TG in our products. We undertake this effort to promote responsible sourcing. Because of our general downstream position in the supply chain, we rely on our suppliers for information. We expect suppliers to respond to our requests for complete transparency about the sources whose 3TG materials are used in our products and to conduct due diligence measures to ensure the information provided is accurate, up-to-date and complete. This Policy applies to all suppliers of products and materials to the Company and to all our affiliates. We will consider taking various progressive actions with respect to suppliers who do not make reasonable efforts to cooperate with our requests for information or requests to take corrective actions to enable us to identify smelters and refiners in our supply chains. 
Risks and Prevention. We regularly assess the risks associated with our business, including the risk of potential corruption or bribery in the environments where we do business, and we have designed our management systems to respond accordingly. As part of our anti-corruption program, our employees and third-party intermediaries are subject to mandatory comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption training online and in-person. The training covers the various forms that corruption can take, red flags, and individuals’ roles in our anti-bribery and anti-corruption efforts.
 In accordance with our policy, we engage a third-party due diligence firm to perform background checks, including bribery and corruption, before entering into commercial relationships with sales and marketing intermediaries, and other service providers.
We communicate our bribery and corruption policies and expectations to our officers, Directors, employees, dealers, distributors and agents. It is the expectation of the Company that all of the aforementioned individuals comply with the requirements set forth in our policy and relevant rules and regulations. 
Managing Compliance and Ethics. We require all employees to be lawful and ethically responsible in all business practices. We expect all employees to comply with all Company policies, applicable laws, and the principles outlined in our Code of Business Conduct. 
Senior members of STERIS’s leadership team are involved in numerous industry associations that focus on setting the standards and driving change. We hold seats and actively participate on the Boards of AdvaMed and the Medical Device Manufacturers Association ("MDMA"). We are also an active member of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ("AAMI") and MedTech Europe. AdvaMed has roughly 400 member companies and promotes policies that foster the highest ethical standards, timely patient access to safe and effective products, and economic policies that reward value creation. The AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with Health Care Professionals ("AdvaMed Code") facilitates ethical interactions between MedTech companies and health care professionals to ensure that medical decisions are based on the best interests of the patient. STERIS has adopted and requires compliance with the AdvaMed Code.
MDMA is the leading voice representing the interests of innovative and entrepreneurial medical technology companies. MDMA's goal is to provide patients and clinicians with timely access to safe and effective medical technologies that improve the quality of life. AAMI is a nonprofit organization founded in 1967. It is a diverse community of more than 10,000 healthcare technology professionals united by one important mission-supporting the healthcare community in the development, management, and use of safe and effective healthcare technology. MedTech Europe is the European trade association for the medical technology industry including diagnostics, medical devices and digital health. MedTech Europe’s purpose is to make innovative medical technology available to more people, while helping healthcare systems move towards a more sustainable path. The MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice regulates all aspects of the industry’s relationship with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and Healthcare Organisations (HCOs), to ensure that all interactions are ethical and professional at all times and to maintain the trust of regulators, and patients. STERIS has adopted and requires compliance with the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice. 
Using the STERIS Integrity Helpline or Webline, employees can anonymously report potential Code of Conduct concerns. A management Ethics Committee meets monthly to monitor and investigate reports of Code of Business Conduct violations and provides quarterly reporting to the Board of Director's Compliance and Technology Committee. With respect to financial matters, reports are provided to the Board of Director’s Audit Committee. 
The STERIS Code of Business Conduct covers ethical marketing and off-label promotion. In fiscal 2022, STERIS incurred no monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with false marketing claims.
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION 
We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in Ireland, the United States and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. Our Continuous Improvement objectives include efforts to improve energy and water efficiency and reduce or eliminate certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, our operations thereby reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. 
We have a broad and comprehensive portfolio of sterilization and disinfection products that support the procedural spaces within hospitals and surgery centers as well as pharmaceutical, medical device and dental Customers. When we think about new products or next generation products, part of our effort is to reduce the environmental impact of what we do. That can include anything from reformulating chemistries to eliminate metals-based ingredients or reducing the effluence produced as a result of the use of our products to creating ultra-concentrate chemistries such as Prolystica® Ultra Concentrate Cleaning Chemistries, which offer 10x the uses per container. That means 5 and 10-liter containers of concentrate replace 114-liter drums, creating benefits from safer lifting, elimination of packaging waste, and less frequent deliveries with smaller trucks. We also work to utilize containers that can be recycled and build products with materials that can be recycled at the end of their life.
Risks and Prevention. We actively monitor and take steps to manage the risks associated with environmental matters, none of which we consider material at this time. 
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Strategy and Overview. People are the key to our success, which is reflected in our two core values of people and teamwork. We are committed to the safety and success of our people. We expect the performance of every person to continually improve with personal initiative and proper support. We expect our people to treat each other with mutual respect. Our ideal business team is engaged, diverse, inclusive and talented, and we create programs and policies in support of these goals.
We believe unity of purpose and teamwork enables us to do far more than we could individually. We draw strength from each other and encourage communication with fairness, candor, respect and courage. Our collaboration turns interesting ideas into great products and services for our Customers.
Our senior management team and Board receive regular updates on our people, including data and metrics on retention, engagement and safety which are used to determine our human resources priorities, programs and training.
We are committed to upholding human rights in all our operations globally and respect human rights as recognized by the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We strongly oppose all forms of slavery, servitude, forced labor, child labor and human trafficking.
Employees by Segment. As of March 31, 2022, we had over 16,000 employees throughout the world including certain locations subject to work council representation and five collective bargaining agreements. We believe we generally have good relations with our employees.
The average number of persons employed by STERIS plc and its subsidiaries during each of the following fiscal years was as follows:

 | Fiscal 2022 | Fiscal 2021
Healthcare | 10,546 | | 8,529 
Applied Sterilization Technologies | 2,961 | | 2,686 
Life Sciences | 1,111 | | 868 
Dental | 1,020 | | — 
Corporate | 784 | | 687 
Total employees | 16,422 | | 12,770


Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I). We are dedicated to creating and sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. We believe that the different ideas, experiences, perspectives and backgrounds of our global employees create a stronger organization that allows us to fulfill our ultimate goal of serving our Customers. To put it simply, we believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is essential to a thriving organization. 
We strive to recruit the best available people who are aligned with and embody our core values. We are committed to equality, assessing candidates based on qualifications. We believe that our success is dependent on attracting and retaining people from a cross-section of our communities who understand their markets, and in doing so we continue to create a competitive advantage for STERIS.

Health, Safety & Environment. We realize the importance of Health, Safety & Environment ("HSE") to the well-being of our Customers, employees, community, the environment, and ultimately our shareholders. To that end, our HSE teams and management are committed to supporting HSE programs with ongoing involvement through our continuous improvement process. Our ultimate goal is to be an incident-free company. The cornerstone of this initiative is the belief that incidents result from unsafe acts or conditions, both of which are preventable. We apply the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping practices worldwide. Key metrics for purposes of benchmarking performance include Total Recordable Cases ("TRC") and Days Away From Work ("DAFW") injury and illness incident rates, both of which are presented in the table below:

 | STERIS | | Industry Benchmarks (2)
 | Fiscal 2022 | Fiscal 2021 | | Average | Best in Class
Total Recordable Cases Rate (1) | 0.85 | 0.91 | | 2.50 | 1.28 
Days Away From Work Rate (1) | 0.24 | 0.37 | | 1.25 | 0.42 

(1)  We apply the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") recordkeeping practices worldwide. All rates are based on 100 full-time employees ("FTE") working one year. 100 FTEs equals 200,000 work hours. TRC includes work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first-aid. DAWF includes work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to be away from work at least one full day after the date of the incident.
(2) Our external benchmarks include the OSHA average and 1st Quartile injury/illness rates which are derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The ISO 14001 and 45001 sets out the criteria that a company can follow to establish an effective HSE management system. Designed for any type of organization, regardless of its activity or sector, it can provide assurance that environmental impact is being measured, controlled and improved in a holistic manner. We currently have 1 facility and 13 reprocessing locations that hold ISO 14001, and 4 facilities and 13 reprocessing locations are 45001 accredited locations.
The OSHA Voluntary Protection Program ("VPP") Star Award recognizes employers who have implemented effective safety and health management systems and maintain injury and illness rates below national Bureau of Labor Statistics averages for their industry. We currently have 12 locations that hold the OSHA VPP Star Award. 
We utilize internal HSE management systems and compliance audits that will identify percent compliance of our global operations against our standards. 
Employee Engagement and Development. We believe that engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and satisfied in their work. Examples of how we engage our employees include quarterly management meetings, a robust intranet for communication with our global teams and various communications efforts within each department. In addition, our global human resources team has programs focused on career development and training for employees at all levels. 
Our employee turnover rate was 17% and 11% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we are continuously working towards a goal of achieving 10% or under, excluding retirements and reductions in force. Although reductions in force are sometimes necessary, we work to avoid them and they must always be approved by executive management. Every year we encourage all employees to participate in our employee engagement survey which is administered by a third party on a confidential basis. This process has been valuable in helping us recognize what we do well and foster an open conversation about how we can make STERIS an even better place to work. We are pleased to report that 88% of our employees completed our 2022 survey. In our most recent survey, we measured fifteen principal factors and overall employee engagement was 75%, in-line with our results for the past five years.The results indicate that the majority of our people are committed to serving our Customers, are proud to work for STERIS, and have confidence in the stability of our business.
We are committed to supporting the development of our people. Employees benefit from hands-on continuous improvement ("Lean") training, a web-based learning management system and STERIS University. In addition, we provide bi-annual Code of Conduct training and other key required training at all levels of the Company. In our manufacturing and service organizations, we provide training for employees who do not have the appropriate experience or background. This training is conducted through a combination of hands-on and module-based training. Our focus is on safety, quality and consistency in approach and outcome. As a Lean focused organization, we have created standard work instructions for many processes and refresher courses are offered regularly for existing employees. Where possible, we look to provide cross-training for employees looking to expand their knowledge or grow into new roles. We encourage all employees to create individual development plans and provide the support to assist in that effort.
Compensation and Benefits. Our total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support our employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including providing competitive salaries, variable performance pay, healthcare benefits, tuition assistance, paid time off, annual merit increases, and incentive plans based on the national norms of employees' employment. Total employee compensation is presented in the table below:

QUALITY
We are subject to strict regulatory compliance and quality standards to ensure the safety and supply of our products and services. The quality and regulatory systems are broad in scope and designed to achieve quality from incoming materials through the design, development, manufacture, storage, handling and distribution of our products and delivery of services. To monitor compliance with these standards, internal and third-party assessments of our quality and regulatory systems are conducted. FDA conducts inspections of our manufacturing and contract sterilization facilities on a periodic basis to confirm compliance. In connection with an inspection, the FDA may initiate warning letters and/or consent decrees, which list conditions or practices that may indicate a violation of the FDA’s requirements. In fiscal 2022, STERIS did not receive any warning letters, seizures, or consent decrees. Additionally, STERIS had zero products listed in the FDA’s MedWatch Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products database.
We have in place processes to monitor and support compliance with product and service regulations worldwide, including design controls, product changes, labeling and advertising, marketing materials, good manufacturing practices, and adverse event reporting requirements. We take prompt action whenever we are alerted to regulatory or field-safety issues with a STERIS product. Following immediate assessment, we take corrective action, including voluntary product recalls, when needed. We examine underlying issues and root cause and work to resolve these to avoid recurrence. STERIS had no Class I recalls in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.
