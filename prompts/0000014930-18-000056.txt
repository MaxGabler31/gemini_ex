Marine Engine Segment
The Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $2,631.8 million in 2017, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). We believe our Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories. 

Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engine and propulsion systems under, among other brand names, the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, and Mercury Diesel brands. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Garelick, Whale, BLA, FulTyme RV, Talamex, Besto, Seachoice, and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts, and lubricants. Mercury Marine supplies integrated, high-speed diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance, and efficiency, Mercury Marine also manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems. 
Mercury Marine's outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state, and foreign governments, and to Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers, and marine service centers. White River Marine Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (including Tracker and Ranger Boats) is Mercury Marine’s most significant external customer.
Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 150 to 300 horsepower. All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 175 to 400 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower. Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,750 horsepower. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States. In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all are compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations. Mercury also makes engines that comply with global emissions and noise regulations.

Mercury continues to develop and integrate innovative technology to enhance the boating experience, including through Mercury VesselView and VesselView Mobile, a connected propulsion system and mobile application that allow customers to display engine information, speed, trim, and more, joystick controls for multi-engine boats, and Active Trim, an intuitive, hands-free system that continually adjusts engine trim based on changes in boat speed to improve performance, fuel economy, and ease of operation. 

Mercury Marine produces its gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan. Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico. Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin. In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in Bella-Veneet Oy, which manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper, and Aquador in Finland.  
For the seventh consecutive year, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council awarded Mercury a “Green Masters” designation, a program measuring a broad range of sustainability issues ranging from energy and water conservation to waste management, community outreach, and education. The designation highlights Mercury's commitment to sustainability as discussed in its 2017 Sustainability Report, detailing specific goals related to energy, environment, products, and people, all of which goals Mercury has met or exceeded. In addition to its fuel-efficient products, water, and energy conservation programs, Mercury installed a new solar panel roof at its European headquarters located in Petit-Rechain, Belgium, in 2017. 
Mercury's parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Lankhorst Taselaar, Payne's Marine, BLA, Attwood, Garelick Mfg. Co., and Whale. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. 
On September 1, 2017, Brunswick acquired 100 percent of Lankhorst Taselaar B.V. (Lankhorst Taselaar), a leading marine parts and accessories distribution company based in the Netherlands and Germany. The acquisition augments the marine parts and accessories businesses through a broader product line and an expanded distribution network.
Intercompany sales to Brunswick's Boat segment represented approximately 10 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2017. Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.

Boat Segment
The Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following types of boats: fiberglass pleasure, sport cruiser, sport fishing and center-console, offshore fishing, aluminum and fiberglass fishing, pontoon, utility, deck, inflatable, and heavy-gauge aluminum. We believe that the Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,103.0 million during 2017, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats.

The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes.

The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Bayliner sport cruisers, runabouts, and Heyday wake boats; Boston Whaler fiberglass offshore boats; Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats, and deck boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local, and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines, and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment. 
The Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, such as Quicksilver, Uttern, and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine.

The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Boat Group utilizes several 
2

contract manufacturing facilities in Poland and Croatia.
The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of more than 2,000 dealers and distributors, with some dealer locations carrying more than one of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 16 percent of Boat Group sales in 2017. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.
Fitness Segment
Our Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures, and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers, and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group, and SCIFIT brands. The Fitness segment also includes our active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories, and game room furniture. 
We believe that our Fitness segment, which had net sales of $1,033.7 million during 2017, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional and collegiate sports teams, retirement and assisted living facilities, and the military and governmental agencies. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer. Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors. Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness website.
The billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business. The billiards business designs and markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, and Air Hockey tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. 
The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Hungary, with principal third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan. Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.
Discontinued Operations
On December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray businesses, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a change in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions, and business trends. As a result, these businesses, which were previously reported in the Company's Boat segment, are being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
On July 17, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. (AMF). In connection with our decision to sell the bowling centers, we also announced our intention to divest our bowling products business. The billiards business, which was previously reported in the Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is being reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented. On September 18, 2014, we completed the sale of our retail bowling business to AMF. On May 22, 2015, we completed the sale of our bowling products business to BlueArc Capital Management L.L.C. As a result of these actions, these businesses, which were previously recorded in the Bowling & Billiards segment, are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. 
We do not have or anticipate having any significant continuing involvement or continuing cash flows associated with these businesses. Refer to Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Financial Services
Through our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers. A subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company owns the remaining 51 percent.
Effective July 31, 2015, the joint venture was extended through December 31, 2019. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term. In June 2016, the parties amended the joint venture agreement to adjust a financial covenant that was conformed to the maximum leverage ratio test contained in our revolving credit facility described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, we offer financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows us to offer a more complete line of financial services to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers.

Refer to Note 10 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services.

Distribution
We utilize independent distributors, dealers, and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and significant portions of our sales of marine engine, fitness, and billiards products. We have over 16,000 Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories: boats, engines, and related parts and accessories.

We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, and Payne's Marine Group, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for our Marine Engine segment in North America. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 20 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. We also believe we are the leading parts and accessories distributor in the Asia-Pacific region.

Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitors' and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution, and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience.

Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments, and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.
Technology
As part of our continuing effort to provide customer value, Brunswick has invested in a variety of technology solutions to further improve customer interaction with our products. In 2017, we entered into a joint venture with TechNexus Holdings, LLC to identify and incubate innovative start-up ventures with strategic marine and fitness applications to help drive long-term growth. In addition, in 2018 we launched Nautic-ON, a smart technology and service system that helps boaters stay connected with their boats remotely, monitoring engine status, battery and bilge pump, and other advanced features. 
Fitness is focused on allowing digital partners to become a key part of the fitness ecosystem, as well as the development of digital solutions focused on driving improved customer outcomes and creating business intelligence, personalized experiences, 
4

and commercial impact. Technology within the Fitness segment includes the LFconnect mobile application, which allows smart devices to interact with compatible Life Fitness equipment and track progress, personalize workouts, and provide motivation and engagement.

Total International Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales | 34 | % | | 34 | % | | 35 | %

We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. 
Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 50 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2017. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:

• | Distribution, sales, service, and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Singapore;


• | Sales or representative offices in Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland;


• | A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;


• | An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China;


• | An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan; and


• | A parts and accessories manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.

Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 19 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2017. The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Croatia and Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, which are sold mostly in international markets through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. 
Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 31 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2017. Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with third-party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan.

Raw Materials and Supplies
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including commodities such as aluminum, resins, oil, and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices.

As our manufacturing operations continued to raise production levels in 2017, our need for raw materials and supplies also increased. During 2017, we experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts, and supplies essential to our manufacturing operations, although such shortages did not materially impact operations. We have addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In 2018, we anticipate our suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing capacity and investments to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers. 
5


We also continue to expand our global procurement operations to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts or derivatives to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices.

Intellectual Property
We have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments. Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities. 

In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives, and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch, and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers.

In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks, and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to boat features and components.

In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components.

The following are our principal trademarks: 
Marine Engine Segment: Attwood, Axius, FulTyme RV, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Talamex, Valiant, Verado, Whale, and Zeus.
Boat Segment: Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Heyday, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray, Thunder Jet, and Uttern.
Fitness Segment: Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Cybex, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, Indoor Cycling Group, Lifecycle, Life Fitness, and SCIFIT.
Competitive Conditions and Position
We believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising, and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products.

Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities.
 The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment:

Marine Engine Segment: We believe the Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and marine parts and accessories. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance, manufacturing capabilities, depth of product portfolio, intuitive product controls, and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution.

Boat Segment: We believe that the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. 
6

Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution.
 Fitness Segment: We believe we are the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as many smaller manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of our fitness equipment offerings include industry-leading product features, and we place significant emphasis on introducing innovative fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, connectivity and customer solutions, and effective promotional activities. The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States. 

Research and Development
We strive to improve our competitive position in all of our segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in our products and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses were 3.1 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent of net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development expenses by segment are discussed in Note 6 – Segment Information.
