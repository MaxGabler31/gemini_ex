ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a global leader in the development and implementation of intelligent infrastructure focused on addressing critical challenges across transportation management, public safety, and key commercial markets. With a real-time intelligence platform driven by deep access to data, AI-powered software, and smart optical devices at-the-edge, we combine our industry expertise and advanced proprietary technologies to deliver unrivaled insights that increase roadway safety, efficiency, and sustainability while enabling safer, smarter, and more connected cities and communities. We operate across 80 countries as we deliver transformative mission-critical intelligent infrastructure solutions and services for government agencies and commercial clients in the United States and around the world. 
Digital Divide
 
Society is increasingly digital, automated, and real-time. Technological advancements in the past decade have transformed the way people connect, interact, and transact with others and with the world around them. Infrastructure is the backbone of a functioning economy: people, vehicles, materials, and information all require 24/7 mobility, something that depends on well-maintained, synchronized networks and systems. Unfortunately, many areas of the world are faced with aging and legacy infrastructure today resulting from decades of neglect and underinvestment, particularly in the sectors of transportation, mobility, and public safety. The cost, complexity and interdependency of these systems have made many organizations slow to adopt advances in technology.  This creates a digital divide between what is made possible by technology, and the current reality of infrastructure today. We see an array of corresponding concerns around mobility, public safety, and sustainability impact:

 | ● | Staggering fatalities and injuries: Globally, roadway crashes cause nearly 1.3 million preventable deaths and 50 million injuries each year – making it the leading killer of children and young people worldwide. These numbers in both absolute and relative terms, have remained largely unchanged for the past 20 years.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Urbanization complexities: As of 2021, 57% of the world's population lives in urban areas, and expected to increase to 68% by 2050, adding about 2.22 billion “connected” people to urban areas. Complexities of urban traffic has been forcing city planners and governments to find smarter ways to improve mobility by reducing traffic congestion, ensure road safety and above all limit serious environmental damage due to increased pollution.
● | Mushrooming Congestion: Traffic congestion costs Americans an average of 97 hours and more than $1,000 in wasted fuel and time every year. 
● | Disjointed systems and siloed communication: Traffic managers and first responders today rely on a patchwork of separate, non-integrated systems. The inability to seamlessly share data between systems and communicate analytical results between agencies and departments in real time, means critical decisions are being made without the most accurate and up-to-date information. 
● | Legacy and underused technology: Most technology currently used for traffic management and public safety is limited to a single purpose and does not make use of the most recent advances in imaging, data science and communications. It is also often priced at a premium, placing it outside the reach of many agencies and departments. 
● | Manual and analog approaches: Current incident and hazard detection relies heavily on physical inspections, observation, and citizen reporting. This creates knowledge gaps, burdens resources, and slows responses. Traffic managers and first responders are obligated to use manual processes to monitor roadway status and communicate with supporting departments. 
● | Outdated, damaged highways: The National Highway System was built in 1956. Since then the population of the United States has more than doubled, while vehicle miles traveled have quadrupled. Today, 50% of roads are rated in poor or mediocre condition. 

 
Continued population growth and increased urbanization present unprecedented economic, mobility, public safety, and environmental challenges to cities, states, and metropolitan areas. Today’s challenges cannot be solved by simply replicating existing approaches and adding more legacy technology. For the ongoing mobility transformation to keep up with fast-changing global dynamics requires inventive approaches. Enhancements in data collection, analytics and communications can be employed. 
 
Smarter, data-driven solutions can make better use of existing infrastructure, rather than tearing it up and starting over. Roads, bridges, tunnels, and residential areas have much “to tell us” about how to optimally serve the public with an efficient, safe, and healthy living environment if we tap into the data it can provide and exploit that knowledge intelligently. Successful approaches will leverage AI-powered software, smart devices, data, and solutions that can integrate into existing infrastructure and workflows. We see this as the path to intelligence-driven infrastructure and one that gives us a clear market advantage.

Bridging the Divide
 
Spurred by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in the United States, we expect the world to see a once-in-a-generation surge of investment in infrastructure and competitiveness. The bill allocates $550 billion in new spending, spread out over five years, to rebuild roads, bridges and rails, and airports, in addition to providing high-speed internet access and addressing climate concerns. As part of this, federal, state, and local governments are prioritizing strategic investments dedicated to improving existing transportation management and increasing public safety through modern, efficient, and connected infrastructure. Officials are also planning for roadways of the future that can account for connected and autonomous vehicles. With these investments, we estimate an addressable global intelligent infrastructure market of $148 billion by 2026.
 
With access to multiple sources of data and our award winning AI-driven innovations, we believe we have established a leadership position in intelligent infrastructure solutions that puts us at the center of this emerging opportunity. With our advanced technology and domain expertise, we have developed solutions that address diverse use cases across a number of public and private sector segments.  Using our proprietary centralized platform to maximize the value of our technology to customers, we are well positioned to help governments and businesses collect, analyze and turn infrastructure data into insights with new products and services that increase mobility and safety, drive revenue, and power innovation for billions of people and trillions of interactions.
 
Intelligence-Driven Innovation
 
As described below, we have concentrated on developing our intelligent infrastructure solutions to work through a single integrated platform, which creates a unique, market-advantaged position for us. The volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of data that we capture and apply to our proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning models provide us with an even greater advantage. From the very beginning, we have been collecting, aggregating, cleansing, extracting, transforming, and using data to build and improve our models. 
 
Today, we can look at the roadway and extract and process a deeply detailed picture of the environment and what is moving in that environment with an unmatched level of accuracy in our inferences, predictive analytics, and insights. We are rapidly growing the geographic area connected by smart optical IoT devices at-the-edge to the open architecture of our Rekor One intelligence platform. In addition to digitizing existing infrastructure by capturing real-time data from new and existing roadway devices, our platform enables us to extend the scope of our knowledge via proprietary algorithms that pull the data and process it through our models. This reduces our clients’ need to invest in legacy system upgrades and gives them the ability to gain additional value from existing infrastructure. Beyond this, we are augmenting our own data through a growing network of data partners.  This provides multiple trillions of additional data points that unlock further real-time and predictive operational insights about what is happening in a given transportation environment at every moment. Example data sources from our partner network include mobility, navigation, and traffic applications, in-vehicle data, connected, autonomous vehicles ("CAV") datasets, weather, supply chain, event management, and a rapidly growing list of customer-provided and crowd-sourced data. The more data we capture and inject into our machine learning models, the smarter and more accurate they become. Due to the incredible strength and accuracy of our models, we can extract more data from the roadways than ever before possible, and generate rich multi-dimensional insights for our customers about what is happening in real-time. In addition, we use AI-driven predictive analytics to forecast what will happen in the next five minutes, in 12 or 24 hours, and even days and months into the future. From these insights, customers can make better informed proactive decisions and achieve improved operational efficiency through a more strategic allocation of resources. All of this is facilitated by our proprietary Rekor One™ intelligence platform.

Our suite of Traffic Management solutions is powered by the Rekor One™ intelligence platform and its proprietary data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies. Within the Traffic Management vertical, we provide a wide range of solutions that can benefit cities, states, municipalities, departments of transportation and transit agencies. These products include software modules for Roadway Monitoring and Response (“RMR”), Traffic and Infrastructure Analytics (“TIA”), and our Live and Archival Traffic View (“LATV”). In all instances, our Rekor One™ Traffic Management solutions include a subscription that allows customers to effectively digitize their data resources from existing infrastructure and leverage that data with third-party data and software based services we provide. As described below, these solutions give them advanced tools to make critical real-time decisions as well as develop long-range strategies that improve the lives of their citizens.
Rekor One™ Traffic Management - Roadway Monitoring and Response
 
Powered by Rekor One™, our RMR solution is a full-scale cross-agency incident detection and management solution that allows customers to effectively implement incident detection and management within their existing workflow and gain real-time access to vital information needed to rapidly identify, manage, and recover from incidents.
 
The RMR solution is used to identify and verify incidents as well as assist in responding to and clearing them. It uses Rekor’s proprietary technology to detect anomalies and irregularities in traffic patterns, understand when incidents happen, and even identify areas of high risk where incidents can potentially occur in the future. These tools make incident detection far more reliable and efficient. Departments of Transportation (“DOT”) are now able to quickly identify the anomalies and incidents on roads in real-time and see them displayed on a user-friendly live map interface. Dashboards provide comprehensive monitoring of roadways and the ability to share information with partner agencies and directly to the public in real-time. RMR also includes reporting capabilities to archive incident and event information, and analytics to help users better understand trends, patterns, and planning. This helps the DOT to make proactive decisions based on the incident spot and immediate incident alarm, providing accurate information about what is happening in the public passageway using the existing surveillance infrastructure. Users are quickly notified of incidents and are alerted to areas of risk identified by our algorithms using multi-sourced data and trends. These insights are just a part of our suite of traffic management solutions which provide a wide array of analytics, reports, data sharing, public communications, and unique HD video management features to help support planning, situational awareness, operations that is vital for our customers.
 
The RMR solution provides dedicated modules that are tailor-made for different users, including modules for traffic management centers, freeway service patrol, first responders, maintenance crews, and transit. Each module provides unique value to individual users, while our proprietary platform brings them all together into one seamless environment. Customers can integrate their current roadside cameras and other devices to feed information directly into the RMR solution and can deploy our advanced IP optical edge devices and cameras to gather additional data from the roadway in real-time. This, in combination with third-party data including data from connected vehicles, GPS, events, construction, weather, and a number of other sources, provides a truly complete view of the roadway and infrastructure systems for customers. These improvements over the traditional incident management infrastructure, and the benefits they offer, have gained significant attention from governing authorities across the globe.
 
Rekor One™ Traffic Management – Traffic and Infrastructure Analytics 
 
Traditional approaches to capturing data for roadway and infrastructure analytics and planning employ expensive, manual processes that use antiquated technology to capture a fraction of the information needed for a fraction of the time. Powered by Rekor One, our TIA solution enables customers get access to comprehensive, de-identified traffic and infrastructure analytics that not only provide instant information on current roadway activity, but also historic information, so that planners and engineers can track patterns, trends, and formulate decisions using both real-time and complete archival data. Customers access their dashboard on web-based cloud instances and review on-demand traffic reports and analytics that breakdown vehicle volumes and patterns, vehicle classification, estimated tonnage, electric vehicle adoption and volume, average greenhouse gas emissions, smog scores, average speed over distance, along with many other tailored views that a customer may select. Customers can easily group different geographies and regions and compare them against one other, drill down into specific dates and times of interest, and even export raw data to further pursue their planning needs. In addition, customers can easily leverage live stream HD video from the edge of the roadway at any time to meet their core missions via our deployed advanced IP optical edge devices and cameras that gather volumes of de-identified data from the roadway in real-time.
 
Our TIA solution can also be of immense value for commercial entities. Many businesses need to understand the vehicle flow, patterns, types, and other important analytics regarding vehicles around their businesses. In addition, the vehicle recognition technology that we deploy to capture this data can be readily leveraged to accomplish a wide range of commercial use-cases. Whether it is a quick-service restaurant that wants to easily identify repeat customers so they can present them with their favorite orders and facilitate contactless payment, or it is a shipping and logistics provider that wants to understand and control the flow of vehicles coming in and out of important areas, our cutting-edge technology can facilitate it.
 
Rekor One™ Traffic Management – Live and Archival Traffic View 
 
Our LATV solution provides highway departments and other agencies an inexpensive and scalable way of delivering more detailed and comprehensive situational awareness of what is happening on their roadways. Many of them already have legacy infrastructure in place to provide situational awareness on the roadway, but much of it focuses only on major roadways, provides limited storage capacity and relies on expensive equipment that often delivers less quality and resolution than is desired. Our LATV solution offers live stream HD video from the edge of the roadway that users can access on-demand. Multiple locations are easily networked and viewed through an optimized web-based dashboard. Users can quickly review and assess locations of interest for instant situational awareness and also search and retrieve archival footage of interest that can be stored on our edge devices for up to 30 days. Authorized agencies are also able to easily share key video footage via secure public and private links.

Rekor One™ Public Safety
 
Our public safety solution includes license plate and vehicle recognition technology that can analyze multi-spectral images and video streams using AI trained algorithms. It can concurrently extract license plate data by state or province from many countries, together with the vehicle’s make, model, color, body type, and direction of travel. Our technology can also capture subtle and unique vehicle characteristics including rust, the presence of a roof rack, mismatched paint, or the like, so law enforcement can leverage that information for investigative policing and forensics. When combined with high performance reads, parallel processing capability and best-in-class hardware accessories, such as optical sensors and communications modules, the solution captures license plate data and vehicle characteristics across multiple lanes at high vehicle speeds with a high degree of accuracy. Our optical sensors are also able to effectively operate in unusually difficult conditions, such as low lighting, poor weather, extreme camera viewing angles, and obstructions.
Rekor One™ Public Safety -  Rekor Contactless Compliance
 
Rekor’s Contactless Compliance application delivers a turnkey information and citation management solution for cities, states, and municipalities for both primary and secondary offenses. Our plate-based Contactless Compliance product provides a safe, equitable, and unbiased enforcement method that requiresno human involvement. Rekor’s contactless compliance programs issue notices and/or send information to registered vehicle owners when a non-compliant vehicle is detected by an optical sensor. Non-compliant vehicles are any vehicles actively detected to be violating the law or otherwise requiring a compliance notice. Non-compliance may include uninsured vehicles, vehicles with expired registration, and vehicles with outdated emissions/inspection statuses. Our contactless compliance programs also include red light and speed violations which have an immediate impact to the safety of others on the road. We provide an application programming interface for third-party payment gateways for credit card transactions to accommodate both phone and web payments. The interface can also automatically record payments in the system and provide functionality to research, manage unapplied payments and reconcile receipts. A full call-center is also provided with our Contactless Compliance product to help facilitate payment or information distribution to non-compliant citizens remotely. We have active deployments of our contactless compliance solution scanning millions of plates and delivering thousands of notices/tickets, including a program for the State of Oklahoma that facilitates enrolling uninsured motorists as well as a number of Automated Traffic Safety Enforcement (“ATSE”) deployments enforcing red light and speed violations.
Rekor One™ Public Safety - Rekor Scout™
 
Rekor Scout provides accurate license plate and vehicle recognition on nearly any IP, traffic, or security camera and can be subscribed to separately for use with existing camera or sensor systems. It displays results on a web-based dashboard that can be accessed from anywhere by any authorized user. The platform connects to National Crime Information Center (“NCIC”) lists and permits the agency to establish customized hotlists with alerts, apply customized data retention policies and share data with other agencies. Vehicles listed on "blacklists" (stolen, terrorists, amber alerts, etc.) generate an alarm in the dispatching room so that they can be intercepted by a patrol. Millions of cars per week are automatically checked in this way.
Rekor One™ Public Safety - Rekor Blue™
 
Rekor Blue™ is our premier smartphone app designed specifically for law enforcement. Built using the same recognition engine as Rekor Scout™, it delivers public safety officers advanced data capture in the palm of the hand, providing access to extremely accurate license plate recognition in areas not covered by stationary or mobile sensors, even without network connectivity. Rekor Blue™  retrieves vehicle license plate number and state of registration and automatically organizes information by sessions, capturing date, location, and timestamp. Verified Rekor Blue™ reads can then sync with the Rekor Scout™ environment and users can receive in-app alerts using plate matches from custom and connected hotlists. With on-device encrypted lists and data, Rekor Blue™  is compliant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Criminal Justice Information System (“CJIS”).

Competitive Strengths
 
Our patented technology has been featured by prominent outlets and has enabled us to further develop our global, expanding footprint. Our award-winning proprietary technology and customer service has allowed us to win competitive bids against legacy incumbents. To date, we have not seen a peer that can provide the breadth, depth, and sophistication that we can on a single integrated platform that can serve multiple missions and agencies. We will continue working hard to capitalize on our first mover advantage and will continue to invest in the company competitiveness and key differentiators.
 
In the traffic management, public safety, and commercial markets, we believe we have, and can further develop a range of competitive strengths:
 

● | Solutions, Not Just Data. Many industry customers are being challenged by a massive amount of data coming from a wide range of sources. A typical department of transportation may see multiple gigabytes of data per day coming from their existing infrastructure while there are multiple terabytes and petabytes of data available from connected vehicles and other third-party sources. With massively increasing volumes of data, many agencies are unable to cope with the velocity, volume, and quality of incoming data, let alone leverage the data and transform it into real, actionable solutions that are built into their daily workflow. We are bridging the industry gap that exists between data and actionable solutions by turning data into information, and information into knowledge and insights through our proprietary technology, solutions, and platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A Single Source. As customers look to source technology solutions from organizations, they are met with a fragmented industry and a broad list of organizations providing only patchwork of disconnected products to meet their varying needs, all of which require separate sourcing through separate vendors. The fact that we are infrastructure and data agnostic and can leverage the same core Rekor One intelligence platform to serve multiple missions and agencies allows us to be a single source provider to meet the needs of the traffic management, public safety, and commercial markets. Whether it is license plate or vehicle recognition, analytics, incident management, smart IoT and IP devices at the Edge, or any other of the wide range of solutions we provide, customers can come to a single source that delivers a platform of solutions for them to access. 
● | Cross-Agency Functionality. The Rekor One intelligence platform supports multiple missions with the same, unified operating system. Rekor One provides government agencies with a comprehensive infrastructure intelligence system that provides actionable solutions so that agencies can make real decisions with real-time information. Governments can leverage their existing IP cameras and transform them into a safe and smart multi-dimensional intelligent roadway network. By building our platform directly into agency workflow, customers can use our solutions as a force multiplier, getting more value and addressing growing concerns across the industry around safety, equity, and sustainability. 
● | Industry Leading Privacy & Security. We use industry leading security technologies and standards to protect all captured and connected data from unauthorized access or use. We leverage end-to-end encryption and proprietary data filters as additional protective measures. Data that we capture is only used to feed our services and solutions. We do not share any PII. Customers can access their data 24/7 until it is purged and have the flexibility to manage their data retention periods based on their needs and local regulation. Our platform also uses AWS GovCloud hosting for secure data handling which is also stored in secure databases where only authorized system admins have access. Additionally, PII is stripped from data using our proprietary algorithm that is completely irreversible. 
● | Higher Accuracy and Capture for Vehicle Recognitions. Most vehicle recognition systems currently in place are accurate only within specified parameters of vehicle speed, viewing angles and lighting conditions. Many also only capture vehicle license plate information with limited or no vehicle recognition information. Our AI software achieves superior accuracy rates under broader parameters of vehicle speed, camera viewing angles and lighting conditions, even capturing plates and vehicle traits through windows. Additionally, we can not only determine the make, model, body type and color of a vehicle, in addition to the number and resident jurisdiction of a license plate, but we are also capturing unique vehicle signatures such as rust, damage, roof racks, and other traits that can be used to further investigation efficacy. This significantly enhances the value of our products and services as compared to systems that provide more limited recognition data and/or lower accuracy rates.
● | Intelligence-Based Policing. Our ability to capture comprehensive data can allow us to detect patterns and analytics around vehicles of interest for law enforcement. 70% of all crime involves a vehicle, and vehicle analytics is a core differentiator for us. As we build and extend our vehicle analytics capabilities, intelligence-based policing is a real deliverable that we can provide to law enforcement, fulfilling a need that has been unmet for years. 
● | Functionality with any IP Cameras. The optical character recognition-based systems marketed by our competitors in the public safety and vehicle recognition market often require customized cameras. Our AI software supports images and vehicle recognition captured by almost any digital camera that provides images that can be sent over the internet. This allows us to be completely infrastructure agnostic, and to deliver products and solutions using relatively inexpensive, consumer-grade, mass-market components that are readily available, significantly smaller, lighter, and less expensive than products currently being used. This allows us to scale quickly across geographies and to enhance the 3rd party data that we ingest, filling gaps and getting a full view of the roadway. 
● | Edge Processing. Our hardware delivers low latency alerting via defined edge processing happening at the edge of the network. This is very valuable to enable applications where real-time processing of data is required, and where speed and scale without the need for expensive infrastructure such as fiber is required.

We have entered into pilots, proof of concept, and full-scale deployment agreements with multiple cities throughout the Americas. We will continue to sell perpetual licenses and hardware when a business opportunity arises, but our core business model is focused on SaaS offerings and services with recurring annual revenues. Our eCommerce site and our recently launched iOS and Android apps allow us to serve smaller organizations and individuals at scale using a low-touch, self-service recurring revenue model.
 
We believe that the market for our solutions and services is very large, with a total addressable market in the intelligent infrastructure segment that has been estimated to grow to $148 billion by 2026. Within this total addressable market, there are a wide range of market segments that we look to address, including: intelligent transportation systems; smart mobility, traffic analytics, incident detection and location systems; traffic management, parking management and enforcement; safe and smart cities and roadways; vehicle regulatory compliance programs; government, military, corporate, community and personal security; commercial real-estate; insurance; advertising; wholesale and large retail logistics and customer loyalty programs; as well as public safety.
 
The vertical-specific solutions powered by our Rekor One intelligence platform have only been offered since 2020. As they continue to gain adoption by both government agencies and commercial entities, we believe that our competitive position will continue to accelerate.

Business Drivers and Growth Strategies
 
We believe that the intelligent infrastructure industry is today at the epicenter of converging forces that will drive changes in the way government agencies and businesses operate. With rising safety concerns on the roadway and an increasing consensus about the need to improve aging infrastructure, we have seen a desire for agencies to adopt new technologies and, better manage an influx of massive amounts of data that is difficult to transform into solutions. An example of this is the significant increase in government funding now committed to expand and digitize transportation infrastructure in the United States. There is also a specific focus on deploying solutions that are scalable, efficient, equitable and sustainable.
 
Rapid urbanization, increased globalization, and increased awareness about the human impact on the planet are all driving factors for intelligent transportation and infrastructure. We believe that our growth will be impacted by increased appreciation of the improvements in security, public safety and business intelligence that can be provided by our products and services. As better and more timely information is made available about the conditions on the roadway and within the boundaries of a city or municipality, more stakeholders will want to make use of this information for different purposes. This includes a growing appreciation of the benefits that smart cities and smart highways can provide.
 
A core strength for us is that we use AI to extract information about the movements of vehicles and other objects on the roadway to enhance safety, increase operational efficiencies, reduce congestion and improve the environment. We believe this can play an important role in enabling intelligent roadways and smart cities. Organizations, including original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the transportation industry are beginning to focus on how to leverage connected vehicle data with AI to improve safety. As we continue to build partnerships and further enhance our solutions with data, we will begin to not only ingest information but also help facilitate the delivery of information back to citizens in real-time.
 
We plan to continue to pursue the growth of our Rekor One™ platform across relevant systems to provide infrastructure information to different state municipalities. The development of the Rekor One platform to share information among multiple agencies to support a variety of community safety, intelligent roadway and revenue generation activities has been a conscious part of our “land and expand” growth strategy.
 
As an organization, we are focused on scaling our resources to support substantial growth within the industry through the expansion of customers, products, services, and partnerships. Our land and expand strategy not only involves expanding the services and solutions we provide to existing customers, but also facilitating cooperation between our existing customers and new customers that can be part of an expanded network of information.
 
As we work to develop our sales and marketing capabilities, we expect our efforts concerning products and services to be concentrated principally on subscription-based solutions, with hardware sales used primarily as a driver for such subscriptions. 
 
We may also use a portion of our cash on hand and common stock for acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies, including companies that might benefit from the use of our technology. However, we do not have agreements or commitments to enter into any such acquisitions or investments at this time. We are looking to be a leader in the industry through organic growth and accelerate our growth and expand our capabilities through strategic partnerships, mergers and acquisitions.

Competition
 
Our current strategy focuses on providing actionable solutions to several markets within the intelligent infrastructure industry. There are a wide range of competitors who provide products and services across parts of our product portfolio as well as within the industry. We categorize our competitors into four types, data creators, data aggregators, insights platforms, and smart city technology providers.

● | Data creators are companies who are creating and collecting data from the field (i.e. via sensors, cameras, vehicles, or other hardware). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Data aggregators are data providers with the ability to consolidate and ingest multiple comprehensive datasets and sell these to their customers. 
● | Insights platforms competitors are technology providers that ingest multiple sources of data and provide a comprehensive, integrated analytics platform that delivers insights.
● | Smart city competitors are companies providing technology solution suites (which may or may not include their offerings) to implement and support “Smart City” functionality. 

 
We also have competitors solely focused on Automatic License Plate Recognition ("ALPR") and vehicle recognition technology in security and public safety applications. Data-focused competitors who are compiling and selling data in some cases also act as a data source partner for us. Additionally, we face competition in certain automated safety solutions from other vendors in the areas of red-light, tolling, uninsured vehicle photo enforcement and speed photo enforcement.
 
In some cases, the continued success of our go-to-market strategy will depend on our ability to develop an appreciation for the value of new or significantly different offerings than are currently available to the market.  In others, our products and services will need to  either appeal to or outperform established industry participants.  Where established markets for our products and services exist, they are characterized by long established relationships. To participate in these markets, we will need to play a role in evolving industry standards and work to gain recognition of the price and performance characteristics of our products. Many of our potential partners and  competitors are in a position to be more competitive through aggressive pricing of currently established products, and may compete by seeking to imitate the Company’s products or even infringe on its intellectual property.
 
Principal competitive factors important to the Company include design innovation, product and service features (including security and privacy features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability and service and support. Where we are not able to partner with established participants, we will need to further develop our marketing and distribution capabilities and our corporate reputation in the market segments we compete in. The Company faces substantial competition in the transportation and public safety markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, many of the Company’s competitors in these markets have a larger installed base of active devices.
 
Most of our competitors only compete in a subset of the market, focusing on their hardware, or leveraging third-party data for a solution. We believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competition using our ability to provide solutions across a wide range of use-cases by (1) more efficiently collecting reliable data from existing infrastructure, (2) aggregating that data with third-party data, (3) processing the data using superior analytical tools, and (4) distributing datasets and actionable insights tailored to the individual needs of multiple agencies through a single platform. We can deliver solutions that meet customer needs across the value chain by using and upgrading existing infrastructure, combining data from the infrastructure with third party data and providing valuable real time, historical and predictive insights drawn from the data to multiple consumers.

Marketing and Sales
 
We offer our products, solutions, and services in various markets.  Our primary route to market is direct to the end-user via a high-touch consultative sales process.  We have strategic alliances and national level partnerships that help us extend our reach and bundle our technology into purpose-built solutions for various market segments.  Our rapidly expanding direct sales force is organized into groups aligned to the Intelligent Traffic Systems (“ITS”) chapters.
 
As we engage further with the DOT and municipalities, we will continue to keep a very focused effort on the law enforcement communities.  Our market-leading solutions continue to provide significant value to those communities, and we will continue to extend that value into an intelligence-based policing framework. Because our technology gives us the ability to understand vehicle characteristics and behaviors above and beyond simple license plate capture, we can support new methods of intelligent policing and regulatory compliance.  In 2022, we also plan to extend our reach into smaller communities through a concentrated inside sales effort and will continue to service the medium-large police departments through our direct sales representatives.
 
As our primary market is state and local government, the majority of our sales efforts end up in a request for proposal process.  In 2022, we will be significantly expanding our proposal team to capture and submit more proposals in total as well as expanding our ability to submit concurrently.
 
eCommerce 
 
Through our eCommerce platform, we allow businesses and individuals to conveniently purchase a full range of our high-value vehicle recognition solutions with just a credit card and a click. The eCommerce platform enables self-service sign-up and a range of subscription options while also acting as a funnel directly to sales support if customers need more information. In 2022, we plan to launch our first hardware device for sale directly through the eCommerce platform. This device is our Edge Pro camera system that has our ALPR software already preloaded and enables customers to activate AI-based vehicle recognition services through a subscription online or by telephone. We plan to launch the product onto the website and ship it to customers globally with the option to add enhancements for solar power and various pole configurations.

Research and Development
 
Because the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. We must also keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Therefore, we expect to continue substantial investments in research and development.
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold a collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software, and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and foreign countries. Although we believe the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in our business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
 
We regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing multiple patent applications. 
 
Acquisitions
 
On August 18, 2021, we completed the Waycare Technology Acquisition.
 
Additional information concerning the Waycare Technology Acquisition is provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under ITEM 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
Human Capital Management
 
Our employees represent the best and brightest in our industry and the talent we select to be a part of our team defines our culture and success. Our global workforce is highly educated, technical and specialized, with a substantial majority of employees working in technical roles.
 
As of March 31, 2022, we had 250 employees, of which 249 were full-time and one was considered part-time. We consider our employee relations to be good. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel.

Seasonality
 
We generate revenues from licensing and subscriptions to our products and services. Therefore, we do not currently anticipate a significant seasonality impact on our revenues. Should our penetration of tolling and other markets involving per recognition fees expand, we would expect to become more subject to seasonal traffic patterns.
Insurance and Risk Management
 
We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury, property and economic loss. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles, and reserves to be adequate. Whenever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety, and other similar methods.
 
Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach for fixed-price contracts and our project execution process. We also evaluate risk through internal risk analyses in which our management reviews higher-risk projects, contracts, or other business decisions that require corporate legal and risk management approval.
 
Regulation
 
We are regulated in some of the fields in which we operate. When working with governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things may require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations. We are subject to the laws and regulations that restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes.
 
To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
