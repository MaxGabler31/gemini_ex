Item 1.    Business
General
Fidelity Southern Corporation (“FSC”, “Fidelity”, or the "Company") is a bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. We conduct operations primarily through Fidelity Bank, a state chartered wholly-owned subsidiary bank (the “Bank”). The Bank was organized as a national banking corporation in 1973 and converted to a Georgia chartered state bank in 2003. LionMark Insurance Company (“LionMark”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSC and is an insurance agency offering consumer credit related insurance products. FSC also owns three subsidiaries established to issue trust preferred securities. The “Company,” “we,” or “our,” as used herein, includes FSC and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
FSC is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. We coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and thereby maintain financial, operational and administrative systems that allow centralized evaluation of subsidiary operations and coordination of selected policies and activities. FSC’s operating revenues and net income are derived primarily from cash dividends received from the Bank. 
At December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $4.7 billion, total net loans of $3.9 billion, total deposits of $4.0 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $446.2 million. For more information about our business, see Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Proposed Merger with Ameris Bancorp
As previously disclosed, on December 17, 2018, Fidelity entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Ameris Bancorp ("Ameris"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, FSC will merge with and into Ameris (the “Merger”), in an all-stock transaction, with Ameris surviving the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Bank will merge (the “Bank Merger”) with and into Ameris’s wholly owned bank subsidiary, Ameris Bank. Ameris Bank will be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Fidelity and Ameris. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter 2019. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to the approval of FSC's shareholders, regulators, and certain other customary closing conditions.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Fidelity’s shareholders will have the right to receive 0.80 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Ameris for each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Fidelity that they hold, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares.
The Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights for both Fidelity and Ameris and further provides that a termination fee of $29.0 million will be payable by Fidelity upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations relating to present or future trends or factors generally affecting the banking industry and specifically affecting our operations, markets and services. These forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements.

These trends and events include: (1) risks related to our proposed Merger with and into Ameris, (2) events adversely affecting our loan portfolio, such as potential difficulties maintaining quality loan growth, the risk of credit losses and an insufficient allowance for loan losses, maintaining and servicing relationships with customers and other counterparties, the ability to rely upon information from customers and other counterparties, and managing changes in our lending operations; (3) events adversely affecting our investment portfolio, resulting in potential impairments or losses that may adversely affect earnings and capital; (4) potential adverse economic conditions at the national, regional, and local levels where we conduct business, and the resulting impact on the quality of our loan portfolio, earnings, and business operations; (5) expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, and the slope and shape of the yield curve; (6) extensive regulation, new or enhanced enforcement of laws and regulations, increased compliance costs, potential failure to comply with laws and regulations, and the possibility of claims or litigation from customers or other parties; (7) maintaining adequate liquidity, the failure or which would adversely impact our growth and ability to meet our current or future funding obligations; (8) our ability to maintain sufficient capital and to raise 
2

additional capital when needed; (9) events affecting our business operations, such as the effectiveness of our risk management framework and internal controls and procedures, our reliance on financial models and the accuracy of such financial models, our reliance on third party vendors, the risk of security breaches and potential fraud, including cyber-fraud, ability to maintain sufficient investment in technological improvements, and potential adverse weather events in the geographic markets in which we operate; (10) events affecting our ability to compete effectively and achieve our strategies, such as greater competitive pressures among financial institutions in our market areas, the risk of failure to achieve the revenue increases expected to result from our acquisitions, branch additions and in our transaction deposit, trust and lending businesses, and our ability to attract and retain skilled people; (11) events that adversely affect our reputation, and the resulting potential adverse impact on our operations in the event of negative public opinion; and (12) risks arising from owning our common stock, such as the volatility and trading volume of our common stock, our ability to pay dividends, the impact of dilution on our common stock, the lack of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance with respect to our common stock, regulatory limitations on stock ownership, and provisions in our bylaws that may make it more difficult for another party to obtain control of us.
This list is intended to identify some of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements included herein and are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties in our business. We assume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements that are made in our 2018 Annual Report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Investors are encouraged to read the risks discussed under “Item 1A.—Risk Factors.”
Our Strategy
Our business strategy has been to build a regional bank which emphasizes relationship banking encompassing loan and deposit gathering along with home mortgages and wealth management services. Our plan has been to continue to grow organically while positioning ourselves for future acquisitions. We believe recent and continuing disruption in the banking industry has created an opportunity for us to realize greater economies of scale compared to smaller community banks while still providing more personalized, local service than larger-sized banks. Our board and management team possesses significant leadership experience which we believe has been an important advantage in executing our business model.
Our operating strategy has been to continue to diversify our revenue streams while becoming more efficient and effective in everything we do. We have organized our operations under a line of business model while centralizing credit, finance, technology and operations functions. We have invested in our infrastructure by making capital expenditures necessary to upgrade our internal systems and software to support long-term growth as well as training and developing our employees to adapt to the corresponding changes. 
Market Area, Products, and Services
We provide an array of financial products and services for business and retail customers primarily in the metropolitan Atlanta and Jacksonville, Orlando, Tallahassee, and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida markets, and online at www.LionBank.com. Our customers are primarily individuals and small to medium-sized businesses. 
We offer products and services through a network of 69 retail branch offices and 37 mortgage loan production offices. During 2017, we expanded our Small Business Administration (“SBA”) business. We originate SBA loans throughout the United States. Mortgage loans are provided throughout the South and parts of the Mid-Atlantic region. During 2018, the market pressures in indirect auto required us to exit all remaining states outside of our existing branch footprint in Georgia and Florida. We have continued to emphasize investing in systems and infrastructure to create efficiencies to provide support for our continued growth.
We have been primarily engaged in attracting deposits from individuals and businesses and using these deposits and borrowed funds to originate commercial, residential mortgage, construction and installment loans. We actively sell residential mortgage loans, SBA loans, and indirect automobile loans, retaining servicing on a significant amount of the sales. Internet banking, including online bill pay and mobile deposit, and internet cash management services are available to individuals and businesses. We also offer cash management services, remote deposit services, and international trade services for businesses. Our Wealth Management business focuses on providing trust administration, investment management, financial and estate planning, specialized lending and banking for affluent and high net worth individuals. Through our marketing partners, we offer merchant services for businesses and credit cards for both individuals and businesses.
We have grown our assets, deposits, and business organically and through acquisition by building on our lending products, expanding our deposit products and delivery capabilities, opening new branches, and hiring experienced bankers with existing customer relationships in our market areas. 
We have successfully completed both FDIC-assisted and non FDIC-assisted transactions in the past. On June 27, 2018, the Bank entered into an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") to terminate the loss share agreements entered into with the FDIC in 2011 and 2012. Fidelity made a cash payment of approximately $632,000 to the FDIC as consideration for the early termination of the agreements. As a result, at December 31, 2018 there were no loans covered by Loss Share Agreements.

Deposits
We provide a full range of deposit accounts and services to both individuals and businesses for which we charge reasonable service fees. We offer competitive interest rates while emphasizing personalized customer service. We also utilize deposits from brokers as a funding source, although to a lesser degree. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our total deposits consisted of the following:

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
($ in thousands) | Amount | | % of Total | | Amount | | % of Total
Noninterest-bearing demand deposits | $ | 1,214,534 | | | 30.5 | % | | $ | 1,125,598 | | 29.1 | %
Interest-bearing deposits: | | | | | | | 
Demand | 474,440 | | | 11.9 | | | 478,428 | | | 12.4
Money market and savings | 1,365,276 | | | 34.3 | | | 1,339,028 | | | 34.6
Time deposits | 835,285 | | | 21.0 | | | 860,613 | | | 22.3
Brokered time deposits | 92,043 | | | 2.3 | | | 63,533 | | | 1.6 
Total deposits | $ | 3,981,578 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 3,867,200 | | 100.0 | %

Total deposits of $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018 increased by $114.4 million, or 3.0%, compared to December 31, 2017. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and interest-bearing demand accounts, including money market accounts and savings deposits accounted for $111.2 million of the increase, as the result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, in both commercial and consumer accounts. Time deposits at December 31, 2018 decreased slightly by $3.2 million, or 0.3%. 
Lending
Our primary lending activities include originating commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses, SBA loans, consumer installment loans (primarily indirect automobile loans), construction loans, and residential real estate loans. Commercial lending consists of the extension of credit for business purposes primarily in Georgia and Florida. We originate SBA loans nationwide. 
Indirect loans are originated in Georgia and Florida. We offer direct installment loans and personal lines of credit to consumers on both a secured and unsecured basis. 
Residential construction loans to home builders and developers are originated primarily in the Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; and Jacksonville, Pensacola and Orlando, Florida metropolitan areas.
The following table summarizes the carrying value of our total net loans outstanding by category as of December 31, 2018:

(in thousands) | Loans | | Loans Held-for-Sale | | Total Loans
Commercial | $ | 904,160 | | | $ | — | | $ | 904,160 
SBA | 156,612 | | | 13,960 | | | 170,572 
Construction | 279,409 | | | — | | | 279,409

Total loans | $ | 3,685,478 | | | $ | 239,302 | | $ | 3,924,780

Certain of the following discussions are in part based on the Bank defined loan portfolios and may not conform to the above classifications.
Commercial and Industrial Lending
We originate commercial and industrial loans that are generally secured by business property such as inventory, equipment and accounts receivable. All commercial loans are evaluated for the adequacy of repayment sources at the time of approval and are regularly reviewed for any deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In most instances, collateral is required to provide an additional source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. The amount and type of the collateral varies from loan to loan depending on the purpose of the loan, the financial strength of the borrower, and the amount and terms of the loan. In addition, we almost always require personal guarantees on these loans.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
We engage in commercial real estate lending through direct originations. Our primary focus is on originating owner-occupied loans to finance real estate out of which an individual or company will operate their business. Non-owner occupied real estate loans for investment purposes are made on a selective basis and only where the borrowers or guarantors add substantial support 
4

to the credit. Loans where the sole source of repayment is derived from the project, or where the absence of the project’s success would significantly impact the ability of the borrower to service the debt, are avoided. We make commercial real estate loans to individuals and to small and medium sized businesses to provide loan diversification, to generate assets that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, and to generate deposit and other relationships. Commercial real estate loans are generally prime-based floating-rate loans or shorter-term (one to five year) fixed-rate loans. At December 31, 2018, approximately 52% of our commercial real estate loans were owner occupied real estate loans. The remaining non-owner occupied loans were generally made to established commercial customers for purposes other than retail development.
SBA Lending
We are a direct SBA 7(a), 504 and U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") lender, providing loans to small businesses nationally. We have a portfolio of SBA loans and SBA loans held-for-sale. These loans are primarily originated to finance commercial real estate purchases, business expansions and new development in SBA and USDA eligible industries with a portion guaranteed by the SBA or the USDA with other credit enhancements. All sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans are executed on a servicing retained basis. We are a national member of the SBA Preferred Lenders Program ("PLP").
Indirect Automobile Lending
We have purchased, on a nonrecourse basis, consumer installment contracts secured by new and used vehicles purchased by consumers from franchised motor vehicle dealers and selected independent dealers located throughout our lending footprint since 1990. We also earn commissions on the sale of consumer credit related insurance policies on these contracts. A portion of our indirect automobile loan production is sold with servicing retained. 
In 2018, we exited all markets in indirect lending except for Florida and Georgia. During 2018, we produced approximately $623.4 million of indirect automobile loans, while selling $133.9 million to third parties with servicing retained, recording gain on sales of $1.4 million. At December 31, 2018, we were servicing $705.6 million in indirect automobile loans we had sold, primarily to other financial institutions; we recorded servicing revenue (including ancillary servicing revenue) of $7.4 million during 2018.
Consumer Lending
Through our retail branch network, we originate consumer loans including automobile loans, residential mortgage and home equity loans, and secured and unsecured personal loans.
Real Estate Construction Lending
We originate real estate construction loans that consist primarily of one-to-four family residential construction loans made to builders. Loan disbursements are closely monitored by management to ensure that funds are being used strictly for the purposes agreed upon in the loan covenants. We employ both internal staff and external inspectors to ensure that requests for loan disbursements are substantiated by regular inspections and reviews. Construction and development loans are similar to all residential loans in that borrowers are underwritten according to their adequacy of repayment sources at the time of approval. Unlike conventional residential lending, however, signs of deterioration in a construction loan or development loan customer’s ability to repay the loan are measured throughout the life of the loan and not only at origination or when the loan becomes past due. In most instances, loan amounts are limited to 80% of the appraised value upon completion of the construction project. We originate real estate construction loans primarily throughout the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Georgia; Savannah, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Jacksonville, Florida; and Orlando, Florida.
Mortgage Banking
Our residential mortgage lending focuses on one-to-four family properties. We offer Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”), Veterans Administration (“VA”), United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and conventional and non-conforming residential mortgage loans. We originate our residential mortgage banking loans primarily in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions through 37 retail mortgage loan production offices. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 89.7% of our residential mortgage loan production of $2.9 billion was for home purchases and 10.3% was for refinances. We are an approved originator and servicer for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), and an approved originator and servicer for loans insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), VA and USDA securitized in Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) mortgage-backed securities.
We primarily sell originated residential mortgage loans to investors, retaining servicing on a significant amount of the loans sold for which we recognize a mortgage servicing asset ("MSR"). The balance of mortgage loans held-for-sale fluctuates due to economic conditions, interest rates, the level of real estate activity, the amount of mortgage loans we retain, and seasonal factors. During 2018, we sold approximately $2.8 billion in originated residential mortgage loans to third party investors consisting of $1.9 billion in conventional loans, $628.9 million in FHA/VA/USDA loans and $239.5 million in jumbo loans. On August 30, 2018, the Bank sold MSRs relating to certain single family mortgage loans serviced for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $1.1 billion, effective as of August 31, 2018 (“Sale Date”). Approximately $13.9 million in deposit balances representing custodial funds and advances related to the MSRs were transferred to the buyer by the Bank after the Sale Date. The sale represented approximately 12% of the Bank’s total single family mortgage servicing portfolio as of August 31, 2018. This was the first sale of MSRs executed by the Bank as part of the Company’s capital management strategy. 
5

At December 31, 2018, we were servicing $9.3 billion in residential mortgage loans we had sold to FNMA, FHLMC, and included in GNMA mortgage-backed securities. We service loans on behalf of the investors or owners of the underlying mortgages. Servicing consists of collecting loan payments, remitting principal and interest payments to investors, managing escrow funds for the payment of mortgage-related expenses such as taxes and insurance, performing loss mitigation activities on behalf of investors and otherwise administering our mortgage loan servicing portfolio. We principally generate servicing revenue through contractual fees earned which are a stated percentage of the unpaid principal balance of current performing loans. We only have exposure to credit risk on sold loans to the extent we are required to make servicing advances until we are contractually authorized to be reimbursed from the loan investors. 
As a seller, we make certain standard representations and warranties at the time of sale with respect to the loans being transferred. To date, our repurchases of mortgage loans previously sold that have been determined to be in violation of these representations and warranties have been minimal. Under our GNMA servicing contract, we have the option but not the obligation of repurchasing previously sold loans once they reach 90 days delinquency.  These repurchases reduce future servicing advances.  In 2018, we repurchased $29.0 million of GNMA loans, and cumulatively, we have repurchased $53.8 million in GNMA loans.
Wealth Management
We began offering trust and investment management services in 2014. We expanded our Wealth Management business and team in 2017 with the addition of client advisors, and assets under management have continued to grow. We provide trust administration, investment management, financial and estate planning, specialized lending and banking for affluent and high net worth individuals.
Significant Operating Policies
Lending Policy
The Board of Directors of the Bank has delegated lending authority to our management, which in turn delegates lending authority to our loan officers, each of whom is limited as to the amount of secured and unsecured loans he or she can make to a single borrower or related group of borrowers. As our lending relationships are important to our success, the Board of Directors of our Bank has established a loan approval committee and written guidelines for lending activities. In particular, the Officers’ Credit Committee reviews all lending relationships with aggregate exposure exceeding $250,000. In addition, the Officers’ Credit Committee approves credit for commercial, SBA and residential construction loan relationships up to the lending limit of the Bank. Other lending areas of the bank, including Consumer, Mortgage, Specialty Lending, and Dealer Finance would also interact with this Committee.
Our policy on calculating total exposure to an entity or individual, or related group of entities or individuals is more encompassing than the method required under law and calls for the combining of all debt to all related entities, regardless of the presence of independent sources of repayment or other conditions that might otherwise allow a portion of debt to be excluded under legal lending limit statutes.
Our written guidelines for lending activities require, among other things, that:

• | secured loans be made to persons and companies who maintain depository relationships with us and who are well-established and have adequate net worth, collateral, and cash flow to support the loan;


• | unsecured loans be made to persons who maintain depository relationships with us and have significant financial strength; and


• | loans secured by real property located primarily in our market areas

Residential construction loans are made through the use of officer guidance lines, which are approved, when appropriate, by the Officers’ Credit Committee. These guidance lines are approved for established builders and developers with track records and adequate financial strength to support the credit being requested. Loans may be granted for speculative starts or for pre-sold residential property to specific purchasers.
Loan Review and Nonperforming Assets
The Credit Review Department reviews our loan portfolio to identify potential deficiencies and recommends appropriate corrective actions. The results of the review are presented to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.
We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management’s evaluation of the loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, performance of acquired purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans since acquisition and any other such factors which, in management’s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating losses. Loans are charged off in whole or in part when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. PCI loans are reviewed quarterly to determine changes in expected cash flows, additional impairment or changes to the accretable yield.
Management estimates the fair value of collateral dependent real estate loans and Other Real Estate (“ORE”) based on the latest appraised value using independent appraisers, trends of similar property values within our market areas and our own 
6

observations and experience with similar properties. For PCI loans, management periodically re-estimates cash flows expected to be collected using key assumptions and estimates such as appraised value, default rates, loss severity given default, and prepayment speed assumptions, similar to those used for the initial fair value estimate. At least quarterly, valuations of impaired and PCI loan collateral are reviewed to take into account the aging of the appraisals and the recent economic trends for the specific types of collateral.
A dedicated special assets team is assigned to evaluate potential nonperforming loans, to properly value nonperforming assets and to facilitate the timely disposition of these assets while minimizing losses.
Asset Liability Management
The Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) manages the mix of and terms related to our assets and liabilities. ALCO monitors balance sheet growth, liquidity, and capital in order to reduce interest rate risk and maximize income. ALCO directs our overall acquisition and allocation of funds, loan sales, and reviews and sets rates on deposits, loans, and fees. The Board of Directors is responsible for the establishment, approval, implementation, and annual review of interest rate risk management strategies, comprehensive policies, procedures, and limits. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that board-approved strategies, policies, and procedures are appropriately executed through a robust interest rate risk measurement process and systems to assess exposures.
Investment Portfolio Policy
Our investment portfolio policy is designed to maximize income consistent with liquidity, risk tolerance, collateral needs, asset quality, regulatory constraints, and asset liability objectives. The policy is reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is provided information on a regular basis concerning significant purchases and sales of investment securities, including resulting gains or losses. They are also provided information related to average maturity, taxable equivalent yield, and appreciation or depreciation by investment categories.
Supervision and Regulation
The following is a brief summary of our supervision and regulation as a financial institution and is not intended to be a complete discussion of all NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) requirements, state or federal rules, statutes and regulations affecting their operations, or that apply generally to business corporations or NASDAQ listed companies. Changes in the rules, statutes and regulations applicable to each entity can affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways.
As a financial institution, we operate under a regulatory framework. The framework outlines a regulatory environment applicable to financial holding companies, bank holding companies, and their subsidiaries. The regulatory framework under which we operate is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our security holders and creditors. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such statutory and regulatory provisions.
General
The current regulatory environment for financial institutions and bank holding companies includes substantial enforcement activity by the federal and state banking agencies, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange (“SEC”), and other state and federal law enforcement agencies, and has experienced an increase in activity in prior years. This environment entails significant compliance requirements and associated costs.
We are a registered bank holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Act”). We are required to file annual and quarterly financial information with the Federal Reserve and are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve.
The Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before: (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that it does not already control; (2) it or any of its non-bank subsidiaries may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; and (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In addition, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. This prohibition does not apply to activities listed in the Act or found by the Federal Reserve, by order or regulation, to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation or order to be closely related to banking are:

• | making or servicing loans and certain types of leases;


• | performing certain data processing services;


• | acting as fiduciary or investment or financial advisor;


• | providing brokerage services;


• | underwriting bank eligible securities;


• | underwriting debt and equity securities on a limited basis through separately capitalized subsidiaries; and

7


• | making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare.

Although the activities of bank holding companies have traditionally been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking (as discussed above), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) relaxed the previous limitations and permitted bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become financial holding companies, which may affiliate with securities firms, and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. Among the activities that are deemed “financial in nature” include:

• | lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others or safeguarding money or securities;


• | insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability, or death, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker with respect thereto;


• | providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, including advising an investment company;


• | issuing or selling instruments representing interest in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; and


• | underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities.

A bank holding company may become a financial holding company under this statute only if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. A bank holding company that falls out of compliance with such requirement may be required to cease engaging in certain activities. Any bank holding company that does not elect to become a financial holding company remains subject to the bank holding company restrictions of the Act. We have no current plans to register as a financial holding company.
As a state bank organized under Georgia law, the Bank is subject to the supervision of, and is regularly examined by, the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance (“GDBF”). We must also register with and file periodic information with the GDBF with respect to the financial condition, operations, management and intercompany relationships for Fidelity, the Bank, and related matters. The GDBF may also require other information as necessary to keep itself informed as to whether the provisions of Georgia law have been complied with, and the GDBF may examine Fidelity. The Florida Office of Financial Regulation (“FOFR”) does not examine or directly regulate out-of-state bank holding companies that have a branch located in the State of Florida. However, the Bank's Florida branches are subject to examination by the FOFR. The Bank is regularly examined by the FDIC. Both the FDIC and GDBF must grant prior approval of any merger, consolidation or other corporation reorganization involving the Bank.
Under the Federal Reserve Act, FSC is an “affiliate” of the Bank. As such, there are certain restrictions on: (1) loans by the Bank to FSC; (2) investments in the stock or securities of FSC by the Bank; (3) the Bank’s taking the stock or securities of an “affiliate” as collateral for loans by the Bank to a borrower; and (4) the Bank's purchase of assets from FSC. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act affects financial institutions in numerous ways, and is expected to continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry for the foreseeable future. 
In November 2017, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, led by Senate Banking Committee Chairman, introduced the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the "Economic Growth Act"). The Economic Growth Act, signed into law on May 24, 2018, provides relief from certain regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Generally, the Economic Growth Act addressed the following areas: the threshold at which banks are classified as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), and therefore subject to stricter oversight; targeted relief from Dodd-Frank Act requirements for smaller banks; capital formation; mortgage lending; student borrower debt and provisions addressing veterans, consumers, and homeowners. While we expect the Economic Growth Act to have an overall positive impact on our business going forward, we continue to evaluate its impact on our business and that impact remains uncertain.
 The following description briefly summarizes aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that impact the Company and the Bank.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Consumer Regulation
The Dodd-Frank Act established a new federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"). The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but are examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. A number of new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations have been issued by the CFPB since its establishment. These new regulations contain various compliance requirements and standards which have increased our compliance costs and create new rights for consumers in the event of certain violations.
Residential Mortgage Loans
The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower's ability to repay. Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require 
8

banks to: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a “reasonable ability to repay” test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage,” in which case a rebuttable presumption exists that the creditor extending the loan has satisfied the reasonable ability to repay test; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for originating and servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, pre-loan counseling, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower's principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products; and (v) maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans for a longer period of time. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers’ ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.
Corporate Governance
The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many corporate governance and executive compensation matters that affects most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt clawback policies for incentive-based compensation plans applicable to executive officers; and provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as directors and require such companies to include such nominees in its proxy materials. Separately, the Dodd-Frank Act requires several federal agencies, including the banking agencies and the SEC, to jointly issue a rule restricting incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions, including bank holding companies and banks. The agencies proposed a rule in 2011, which was replaced with a new proposed rule in May 2016, but the rule has not yet been finalized.
Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision
The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies. These new standards are to be no less strict than existing regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may, in fact, become higher once the agencies promulgate the new standards. See discussion of the capital requirements under “Capital Adequacy” below.
FDIC Insurance Assessments
Deposits in our bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the GBDF. Our management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank's deposit insurance. 
The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium as determined by multiplying an insured bank's assessment base by its assessment rate. The amount each institution is assessed is based upon statutory factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the FDIC insurance coverage limit per depositor from $100,000 to $250,000.
The deposit insurance assessment system is mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. On May 20, 2016, the FDIC amended its rule to refine the deposit insurance assessment system for small insured depository institutions that have been federally insured for at least five years that became effective on July 1, 2016. The rule, which applies to banks with less than $10 billion in assets, became effective as of June 30, 2016. On August 31, 2016, as a result, the calculation adopted in the final rule for Small Bank FDIC Assessments began in the third quarter of 2016. The assessment rate schedule was also revised to a range of 3 to 30 basis points annually, and fully adjusted rates will range from 1.5 to 40 basis points annually but this range is subject to change as the DIF's reserve ratio continues to grow.
Payment of Dividends
FSC is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of the revenue we receive results from dividends paid to us by the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as by us to our shareholders.
Under the regulations of the GDBF, dividends may not be declared out of the retained earnings of a state bank without first obtaining the written permission of the GDBF, unless such bank meets all the following requirements:

(a) | total classified assets as of the most recent examination of the bank do not exceed 80% of equity capital (as defined by regulation);


(b) | the aggregate amount of dividends declared or anticipated to be declared in the calendar year does not exceed 50% of the net profits after taxes but before dividends for the previous calendar year; and

9


(c) | the ratio of equity capital to adjusted assets is not less than 6%.

The payment of dividends by Fidelity and the Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. In addition, if, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending upon the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The FDIC has issued a policy statement providing that insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. In addition to the formal statutes and regulations, regulatory authorities consider the adequacy of the Bank’s total capital in relation to its assets, deposits and other such items. Capital adequacy considerations could further limit the availability of dividends to the Bank.
In 2018 and 2017, FSC paid $13.0 million and $12.7 million in cash dividends on its common shares, respectively. In 2018 and 2017, the Bank paid cash dividends of $9.3 million and $9.0 million to FSC, respectively. In 2018, FSC received no dividends from its wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, LionMark. In 2017, FSC received dividends of $1.5 million from its wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, LionMark. The Boards of Directors for the Bank, LionMark and FSC review whether to declare and pay dividends on a quarterly basis, in light of current regulatory limitations, earnings, capital requirements, and forecasts of future earnings.
Capital Adequacy
Basel III
On July 2, 2013, the Federal banking regulators, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and the FDIC each approved rules implementing new capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations in accordance with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("BCBS") framework for capital ("Basel III"). Under these rules, minimum requirements increase for both the quantity and quality of capital we maintain. 
The rules include a new "Common Equity Tier 1" or "CET1" capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.50% and a CET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.50% of risk-weighted assets. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.  The capital conservation buffer began phasing in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and continues to increase at the same rate each subsequent year until reaching its final level of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019. As of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer has been fully phased in. 
The rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.00% to 6.00%, and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.00%. The rules implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, including limitations on MSRs and DTAs, requiring us to deduct a much larger portion of the value of our mortgage servicing rights from our Tier 1 capital. Basel III limits the amount of MSRs and DTAs to 10 percent of CET1, individually, and 15 percent of CET1, in the aggregate.
Prompt Corrective Action
The final rules implementing the Basel III capital guidelines revised the capital levels at which the Bank becomes subject to corrective action. The federal banking agencies have broad powers with which to require companies to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five capital categories for this purpose: (i) well-capitalized; (ii) adequately capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized; (iv) significantly undercapitalized; and (v) critically undercapitalized. To be considered well-capitalized, an institution generally must have risk-based Total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios of at least 10.00% and 6.00%, respectively, and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. To be considered “adequately capitalized,” we are subject to minimum CET1, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital ratios of 4.50%, 6.00%, and 8.00%, respectively. CET1 is comprised of Tier 1 capital less amounts attributable to qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders’ equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, less intangible assets and disallowed portions of our loan servicing rights. Total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital plus certain adjustments, the largest of which is our qualifying subordinated debt, as well as the allowable portion of the allowance for loan losses.
 Failure to meet applicable capital standards could subject the bank holding company or the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.
To continue to conduct our business as currently conducted, we must maintain capital levels well above the minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2018, and 2017, the capital ratios for the Bank and FSC exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be well-capitalized discussed above.

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
In May of 2018, Congress passed and the President signed into law, the Economic Growth Act. Among many important changes to the regulation of the banking industry, the Economic Growth Act ordered the federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and FDIC to, through notice and comment rulemaking, develop an “off-ramp” exempting certain banking organizations with less than $10.0 billion in consolidated assets and a low-risk profile from generally applicable leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements if such banking organization maintained a leverage ratio to be set by the federal banking regulators (the “Community Bank Leverage Ratio”). The Economic Growth Act requires the federal banking regulators to set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio between 8% and 10%. On November 21, 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement Section 201 of the Economic Growth Act. The proposed rule would set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. To date, the proposed rule implementing Section 201 of the Economic Growth Act has not been finalized.
Commercial Real Estate
In December 2006, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued final guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending (the “Guidance”), noting that increases in banks’ commercial real estate concentrations could create safety and soundness concerns in the event of a significant economic downturn. The Guidance mandated certain minimal risk management practices and categorized banks with defined levels of such concentrations as banks that may warrant elevated examiner scrutiny. The regulatory guideline defined a bank as having a concentration in commercial real estate if its portfolio of land, construction (both commercial and residential) and Acquisition and Development loans (“A&D loans”) exceeds 100% of the Bank’s total risk based capital. On December 18, 2015, an Interagency CRE Statement was issued on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending reminding financial institutions to re-examine existing regulations and guidance related to CRE lending on the management of concentration risk in CRE lending. Our ratio of total Land, Construction and A&D loans to total risk-based capital was 57% at December 31, 2017 and 60% at December 31, 2018. The regulatory guideline for all commercial real estate loans, except owner-occupied property, as a percentage of capital is a maximum of 300%. Our ratio of all commercial real estate loans, except owner-occupied property, as a percentage of capital, was 127% at December 31, 2017 and 137% at December 31, 2018.
The Guidance does not formally prohibit a bank from exceeding either of these two thresholds. Rather, it defines the circumstances under which a bank will be declared to have a commercial real estate concentration. Further, the Guidance requires any banks with commercial real estate concentrations to have heightened and sophisticated risk management systems in place to adequately manage the increased levels of risk. Management believes that our credit processes, procedures and systems continue to meet the risk management standards required by the Guidance and we continue to maintain our commercial real estate loan portfolio at a level below the concentration thresholds. Regulatory authorities continue to emphasize the risks associated with CRE lending and focus on our implementation of the Guidance which could effectively limit future increases in the commercial real estate concentrations in our loan portfolios or require additional credit administration and management costs.

Loans
Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulators mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital. The Bank adopted the federal guidelines in 2001.
Transactions with Affiliates
Under federal law, all transactions between and among a state nonmember bank and its affiliates, which include holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit these transactions to a percentage of the bank’s capital and require all of them to be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The FDIC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank. The regulations also set forth various reporting requirements relating to transactions with affiliates.
Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity
In accordance with the GLB Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.
Federal regulators have issued various statements regarding cybersecurity over the past few years. These statements recommend that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The statements provide that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. 
Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act
A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating terrorist financing. This has generally been accomplished by amending existing anti-money laundering laws and regulations. We are subject to the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”) which imposes significant compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties. The Treasury has issued a number of implementing regulations that apply to various requirements of the USA Patriot Act. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Future Legislation
Various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced in Congress. Such legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or our results of operations. 
Competition
The banking business is highly competitive. We compete for traditional bank business with numerous other financial institutions in our primary market areas for residential construction and development loans, commercial loans, SBA loans, 
12

residential mortgages, and indirect automobile loans. We also compete for loans with insurance companies, regulated small loan companies, credit unions, and certain governmental agencies. We compete with independent brokerage and investment companies, as well as state and national banks and their affiliates and other financial companies for trust services. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources.
The indirect automobile financing and residential mortgage banking industries are also highly competitive. In the indirect automobile financing industry, we compete with specialty consumer finance companies, including automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies, in addition to other financial institutions. The residential mortgage banking business competes with independent mortgage banking companies, state and national banks and their subsidiaries, as well as thrift institutions and insurance companies.
Employees and Executive Officers
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,407 full-time equivalent employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good. We offer our employees a variety of competitive benefit programs including a retirement plan and group health, life and other insurance programs. We also support training and educational programs designed to ensure that employees have the types and levels of skills needed to perform at their best in their current positions and to help them prepare for positions of increased responsibility.
