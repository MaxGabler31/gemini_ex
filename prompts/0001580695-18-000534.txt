ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Organization and History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in 1970 as Standard Silver Corporation. In July 2004, our Articles of Incorporation were amended and restated to increase the number of shares of common stock to 25,000,000, and in March 2007, we affected a 1 for 2 reverse stock split. In September 2008, we amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation to: (i) increase of the number of shares of common stock from 25,000,000 to 100,000,000; and to (ii) authorize an additional 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, to be issued at management’s discretion. In September 2010, we amended our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to change our name from Standard Silver Corporation to Texas Rare Earth Resources Corp.
 
On August 24, 2012, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”) pursuant to a plan of conversion dated August 24, 2012. The Reincorporation was previously submitted to a vote of, and approved by, our stockholders at a special meeting of the stockholders held on April 25, 2012.
 
On March 14, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to change the name of the Company from “Texas Rare Earth Resources Corp” to “Texas Mineral Resources Corp”. The amendment became effective on March 21, 2016. The Certificate of Amendment did not make any other amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation.
 
Our common stock is traded on the OTCQX U.S. operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol “TMRC.” The market for our common stock on the OTCQX U.S. is extremely limited, sporadic and highly volatile.
 
Our fiscal year-end is August 31.
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
We are a mining company engaged in the business of the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We currently hold two eleven year leases, executed in September 2011 and November 2011 respectively, to explore and develop a 950 acre rare earths project located in Hudspeth County, Texas known as the Round Top Project. We also have prospecting permits covering 9,345 acres adjacent to the Round Top Project. Our principal focus is on developing a metallurgical process to concentrate or otherwise extract the metals from the Round Top Project’s rhyolite, although we will continue to examine other opportunities in the region as they develop. We currently have limited operations and have not established that any of our projects or properties contain any Proven or Probable Reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 (“Guide 7”).
 
On November 8, 2011, we announced that our supplementary operating plan to expand exploration activities at our Round Top Project had been approved by the Texas General Land Office (GLO); the expanded development and exploration drill plan called for an additional 40 drill holes and 4 diamond core holes for an estimated planned drilled footage of 20,000 feet. The program included 4,000 feet of Core drilling to establish a high level of confidence in the mineralization, provide physical engineering data and additional metallurgical sample. During 2011-2012 the permits were amended and there were 41,765 feet of reverse circulation drilling and 1,294.5 feet of core drilling done on Round Top.
 
March 20, 2012, we submitted for approval an updated plan of operations. The updated plan of operations consisted of the reclassification of the drilling program through to a feasibility study into three phases. Phase 1 consists of 25 drill locations, phase 2 consists of 41 drill locations and phase 3 consists of 27 drill locations all located on the Round Top Project. The plan of operations also included two locations for 100 ton bulk sample collection for additional metallurgical tests. We have suspended this phase of physical exploration and development at the Round Top Project pending development of a metallurgical process to extract the potentially marketable metals.
 
On June 22, 2012, we published our Preliminary Economic Assessment for our Round Top Project, entitled “NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment Round Top Project, Sierra Blanca, Texas,” dated June 22, 2012, effective as of May 15, 2012 (the “PEA”).
 
On October 3, 2012, our management released updated economic projections related to various revisions to the proposed mine plan presented in the PEA.
 
On March 6, 2013, we purchased the surface lease at the Round Top Project, known as the West Lease, from the Southwest Wildlife and Range Foundation (the “Foundation”) for $500,000 cash and 1,063,830 shares of our common stock. We also agreed to support the Foundation through an annual payment of $45,000 for ten years to support conservation efforts within the Rio Grande Basin and in particular engaging in stewardship of Lake Amistad, a large and well-known fishing lake near Del Rio, Texas. The West Lease comprises approximately 54,990 acres. Most importantly, purchase of the surface lease gave us unrestricted surface access for the potential development and mining of our Round Top Project. As of the date of this filing the $45,000 payments due in June 2016, 2017 and 2018 have not been paid; consequently, we have expensed the value of the West Lease during fiscal 2017. We fully intend to continue with the evaluation of the mineral potential of the property, to ultimately mine the property, and to bring the lease current when funds are available. Expensing the value of the West Lease does not restrict our access to the mineral leases.

On May 8, 2013, we released testing results by an independent laboratory of the leaching characteristic of the rhyolite at our Round Top Project, which demonstrates characteristics that may be favorable to heap leach mining at the Round Top Project. These leaching characteristics are described in greater detail below under the section heading “Item 2. Properties – Round Top Project – Metallurgy”.
 
On September 30, 2013 we released the results on column leach testing by an independent laboratory and announced our intention to issue a revised PEA based on a heap leach operation designed to produce approximately 2,500 tons per year of heavy rare earth elements plus yttrium. The column leach testing results are described in greater detail below under the section heading “Item 2. Properties – Round Top Project – Metallurgy”.
 
On December 23, 2013, we published a revised version of the June 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “Revised PEA”) based on a 20,000 tonne per day heap leach operation using a conventional element separation plant. The mineralized material estimate was recalculated to include uranium, niobium, tantalum and tin. The Revised PEA assesses the potential economic viability of the simplified and “scaled down” operation which we believe is a much better fit with the present rare earth market.
 
On September 8, 2014, we announced that we had completed an internal analysis suggesting that there is a reasonable possibility to adapt a lower volume staged growth approach to development of our Round Top project. The analysis indicated that an operation designed to produce a selected group of separated REE products in the range of 350-450 tonnes per year range, could potentially yield favorable mine economics. The goal of the proposed staged approach would be to increase mining rates if and when our products gained acceptability. The analysis suggested that capital needs in the Revised PEA could be proportionally reduced in relation to the lower volume initial stage. We are currently conducting a more detailed analysis of the relative capital expenses and operating expenses requirements of a scaled down processing plant with both solvent extraction and ion exchange processes under evaluation. We believe the lower capital requirements of a staged startup could offset any marginal increase in unit operating costs.
 
On October 29, 2014, we announced that we had executed agreements with the Texas General Land Office securing the option to purchase the surface rights covering the potential Round Top project mine and plant areas and, separately, a lease to develop the water necessary for the potential Round Top project mine operations. The option to purchase the surface rights covers approximately 5,670 acres over the mining lease and the additional acreage adequate to site all potential heap leaching and processing operations as currently anticipated by the Company. We may exercise the option for all or part of the option acreage at any time during the sixteen year primary term of the mineral lease. The option can be kept current by an annual payment of $10,000. The purchase price will be the appraised value of the surface at the time of exercising the option. The annual payment for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017 and 2018 has not been made as of the date of this filing.
 
The ground water lease secures our right to develop the ground water within a 13,120 acre lease area located approximately 4 miles from the Round Top deposit. The lease area contains five existing water wells. It is anticipated that all potential water needs for the Round Top project mine operations would be satisfied by the existing wells covered by this water lease. This lease has an annual minimum production payment of $5,000 prior to production of water for the operation. After initiation of production we will pay $0.95 per thousand gallons or $20,000 annually, whichever is greater. This lease remains effective as long as the mineral lease is in effect. The minimum production payment for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017 and 2018 has not been made as of the date of this filing and this lease will of necessity require renegotiation.
 
On February 24, 2015, we signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with K-Technologies, Inc. (K-Tech), a chemical process development and applications company serving the minerals and chemicals industries to develop, refine and market K-Tech’s Continuous Ion Exchange (CIX) and Continuous Ion Chromatography (CIC) technology as it applies primarily to the extraction of rare earth elements (REE) from native ores. The joint venture will license the technology to us, as well as other rare earth production companies. Subject to agreement by TMRC, the joint venture may also elect to build and operate processing facilities to separate and purify mixed rare earth concentrates into individual purified rare earth oxides for other rare earth production companies in addition to TMRC.
 
In early March 2015, we conducted a trial mining test during which we mined 500 tonnes of rhyolite, transported and crushed the ore to 80% passing a 1 ј inch screen. This rock is now stockpiled and will be used in the Stage 2 pilot plant development, as described in greater detail below under the section heading “Item 2. Properties – Round Top Project – Metallurgy”.
 
On May 26, 2015, we announced that K-tech had successfully produced a low cerium concentrate solution employing their CIX/CIC process. This concentrate solution was separated from crushed Round Top rhyolite leached in 8 inch by 8 foot columns. If precipitated, dried and calcined, this concentrate would be salable in the present rare earth market. Neither uranium nor thorium was detected in the rare earth concentrate. Further test work has shown that it is possible to remove both uranium and thorium from the spent solution from the REE extraction plant. Production of the low cerium concentrate essentially completed Phase 2 of Stage 1 of our development process, with the production of final purified elemental oxides being the only step remaining to complete Phase 2 of Stage 1.

On April 6, 2015, we announced the execution of a uranium offtake agreement with UG USA, a subsidiary of Areva. According to the agreement, TMRC will supply up to 300,000 pounds of natural uranium concentrates (U308) per year based upon a pricing formula indexed to U308 spot prices at the times of delivery. The Agreement is for a term of five years commencing in 2018 or as soon thereafter, contingent upon development and production at its Round Top project. Other terms and conditions of the Agreement reflect industry standards. According to Ux Consulting, a leading uranium industry data provider, the closing spot price of U308 on March 30, 2015 was $39.50 per pound. 
 
On July 15, 2015, we entered into an operating agreement (“Operating Agreement”) with K-Tech, to formalize our joint venture company, Reetech, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Reetech”), which gives TMRC the exclusive license to market K-Tech’s CIX/CIC process to other rare earth developers pursuant to the February 24, 2015 letter of intent with K-Tech. On October 18, 2015, we entered into an amendment agreement to the Operating Agreement, expanding the way in which we can earn percentage membership interests in Reetech in exchange for granting K-Tech changes in the management of Reetech and TMRC’s license from Reetech to use K-Tech’s CIX/CIC process for its properties.
 
The operating agreement between TMRC and K-Tech is still in effect, but due to the inactivity of our Round Top project, there has been no ongoing advancement under the operating agreement as of August 31, 2018.
 
See “Item 2. Properties – Metal Recovery Methods” for a more detailed description of the Reetech joint venture.
 
On September 25, 2015, we announced that Reetech was awarded a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) research contract by the United States Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Materials Division. The Defense Logistics Agency is the Department of Defense’s largest logistics combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services as well as several civilian agencies and foreign countries. The DLA Strategic Materials Division is charged with maintaining cognizance of worldwide strategic and critical material’s supply chain from the source to final assembly, evaluating the capability of these supply chains to support national defense and essential civilian industries, and developing mitigation solutions when access to materials are insufficient to provide support for national defense and emergency response.
 
Reetech will conduct research to demonstrate, at the bench scale level, the ability to separate and refine yttrium (Y) oxide to a minimum of 99.999% purity, ytterbium (Yb) oxide to a minimum of 99.99% purity and a third rare earth oxide, which is not being publicly disclosed, to a minimum 99.999% purity level, using continuous ion exchange (CIX) and continuous ion chromatography (CIC).
 
On August 28 2018 TMRC executed a Joint Venture agreement with Morzev PTY LTD, doing business as USA Rare Earth, to develop the Round Top Deposit. Terms of the agreement call for USA Rare Earth to expend up to $10 million to produce a bankable feasibility study. The funds will be allocated in two tranches, the first of $2.5 Million to optimize and finalize the metallurgical processing and the remaining $7.5 million to complete the engineering, design, geotechnical work, and permitting necessary for a bankable feasibility study. USA Rare Earth will earn 70% of the property upon production of the feasibility study and has the option of purchasing another 10% for $3 million at the completion of the feasibility study.
 
Cautionary Note to Investors: The PEA and Revised PEA have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 — Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) — CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. The Company has voluntarily had the PEA and Revised PEA prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 but the Company is not subject to regulation by Canadian regulatory authorities and no Canadian regulatory authority has reviewed the PEA or Revised PEA or passed upon its accuracy or compliance with NI 43-101. The terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7 under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information in the PEA and Revised PEA contains descriptions of our mineral deposits that may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Our project as described in the PEA and Revised PEA currently does not contain any known proven or probable ore reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 reporting standards. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in the Registrant’s latest reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources in these categories will ever be converted into SEC Guide 7 compliant reserves.

During 2017 TMRC in association with Penn State University, REE Tech and Inventure Renewables of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, jointly applied for a Department of Energy grant to evaluate the economic potential of rare earth elements associated with Appalachian coal deposits. Our group was awarded the first phase of this grant on October 19 2017. Work in progress consists of identifying a resource, (TMRC), developing the physical metallurgy to concentrate the minerals (Penn State) and developing the CIX/CIC process to separate the individual rare earth elements and to separate and refine various other elements including iron and aluminum (Inventure and K-Technologies).

Current and Planned Exploration Activities
 
Stage 1
 
Upon receipt of adequate further financing, we plan to complete the development of the CIX/CIC processing of the Round Top primary leach solution. The bench scale testing of this process, Stage 1, was divided into two phases. Phase 1, now completed, was to purify the primary leach solution and produce a concentrated, low flow rate feedstock suitable for further processing by CIX/CIC. Development has now progressed into Phase 2 which is to effect a separation of the rare earth elements into groups for final refinement. In work completed to date, we have produced a concentrated solution from which we have removed the low value elements lanthanum and cerium. The resulting solution containing the high value rare earth elements could be precipitated into a marketable concentrate if so desired.
Stage 2
 
Stage 2 will consist of the pilot plant scale testing of the process proven most effective by Stage 1. This work will consist of extensive leach testing using large columns to optimize leach recovery of REE and other elements including lithium and aluminum. If conditions require it, a pilot scale trial heap leach will be accomplished. This stage will also develop the continuous ion exchange and ion chromatographical system using primary leach solution produced by the large diameter columns. This phase of work is intended to bring the processing plant into full feasibility with capital and operating costs estimated to an accuracy range of 10 -15%. Stage 2 will also develop the heap leach procedure to pre-feasibility level with capital and operating estimated to an accuracy of 25 - 35%. Environmental base line studies and initial co-ordination with the Texas regulatory agencies will be included in this stage.
Stage 3
 
Stage 3 will bring the Round Top Project to full feasibility level with all electrical power and water needs developed, final engineering of heap leach systems, mine design and engineering, geotechnical drilling and construction planning, and permitting in place. Additional drilling to bring all of the rock included in the 20 year pit to a measured or indicated resourced category.
Trends – Rare-Earth Market
 
Rare earth elements (or “REEs”) are a group of chemically similar elements that usually are found together in nature; they are referred to as the “lanthanide series.” These individual elements have a variety of characteristics that are important in a wide range of technologies, products, and applications and are critical inputs in existing and emerging applications including: computer hard drives, cell phones, clean energy technologies, such as hybrid and electric vehicles and wind power turbines; multiple high-tech uses, including fiber optics, lasers and hard disk drives; numerous defense applications, such as guidance and control systems and global positioning systems; and advanced water treatment technology for use in industrial, military and outdoor recreation applications. As a result, global demand for REE is projected to steadily increase due to continuing growth in existing applications and increased innovation and development of new end uses. Interest in developing resources domestically has become a strategic necessity as there is limited production of these elements outside of China. Our ability to raise additional funds in order to complete our plan of exploration and, if warranted, development at the Round Top Project may be impacted by future prices for REEs.
 
Rare earth prices are extremely depressed at this time. It is thought that the liquidation of excessive inventories in China is causing these depressed prices. Chinese sources observe that most of the Chinese primary producers are not showing profit at this time. However, demand for rare earth products continues to grow at a healthy rate. We believe that the present prices will likely prevail for the next year at least until the surplus Chinese product is absorbed by the market.
 
Pricing for REEs has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, but current prices for all REEs remain significantly higher than pre-2010 levels, although they have fallen from the peak levels seen in 2011. According to www.metal-pages.com (“Metal-Pages”) REE prices increased from mid-2010 to mid-2011 approximately 2,000 to 3,000 percent, depending on the element, and then REE prices began decreasing through the end of 2011. REO prices of individual oxides increased considerably during the first two quarters of 2011 but declined thereafter through to the end of the year. Beginning in the second quarter of 2012, REE prices have decreased significantly for all REEs.
 
Pricing is affected by a number of factors, including the general health of the global economy, efforts to institute greater environmental reforms in China, industry consolidation, stockpile build-ups in China and by consumers and governments, lack of certainty regarding future REE production, development and continued use of REE technologies, potential oversupply, potential substitution of other metals, and potential for recycling REEs.
 
REE supply markets are dominated by China. Although the actual production and pricing is not precisely known, they supply an estimated 80% of the global REE production. Demand is steadily increasing. Recent geopolitical developments have led the Department of Defense to issue cautionary statements regarding the security of the supply chain of REE to the defense industry.
 
We plan on focusing primarily on the REE magnet metals Praseodymium, Neodymium and Dysprosium, the high value Lutetium and the so-called “heavy” rare earth elements Holmium, Thulium, Erbium and Ytterbium which have developing applications for a variety of defense uses including weaponized lasers and alloy metal for high strength Aluminum.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We are currently in the exploration stage and as such we do not require any significant raw materials in order to carry out our primary operating activities. Our primary operating objective is to explore and develop the Round Top Project. For at least the next year, we expect to continue to require the use of contract drilling services in order to obtain additional geological information. In the past year we have been able to secure contract drilling services without excessive delay and costs. We expect the contract drilling services will continue to be available over the next year.
 
The raw materials that our current operations rely on are gasoline and diesel fuel for the exploration vehicles and for the heavy equipment required to build roads and conduct drilling operations. Water is provided per service contract by Eagle Mountain Gang which is used for the drilling operations.
 
Seasonality
 
Seasonality in the State of Texas is not a material factor to our operations for our project.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous companies, substantially all with greater financial resources available to them. We therefore are operating at a significant disadvantage in the course of acquiring mining properties and obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment. Additionally, we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of exploration and mineral property development. A large number of established and well-financed companies are active in the mining industry and will have an advantage over us if they are competing for the same properties. Nearly all such entities have greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than ourselves and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible mining properties and procuring the same.
 
China accounts for the vast majority of rare earth element production. While rare earth element projects exist outside of China, very few are in actual production. Further, given the timeline for current exploration projects to come into production, if at all, it is likely that the Chinese will be able to dominate the market for rare earth elements into the future. This gives the Chinese a competitive advantage in controlling the supply of rare earth elements and engaging in competitive price reductions to discourage competition. Any increase in the amount of rare earth elements exported from other nations, and increased competition, may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors.
 
Government Approvals
 
The exploration, drilling and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. Thus permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.
 
Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All of these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically reevaluated at that time.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
 
Overview. Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of its operations. These include “permitting” or pre-operating approval requirements designed to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, operating requirements designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, mining operations, and reclamation or post-operation requirements designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once commercial mining operations have ceased.

Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
 
The Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act is the principal federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 
At the state level, water quality is regulated by the Environment Department, Water and Waste Management Division under the Water Quality Act (state). If our exploration or any future development activities might affect a ground water aquifer, it will have to apply for a Ground Water Discharge Permit from the Ground Water Quality Bureau in compliance with the Groundwater Regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with the Surface Water Regulations is required.
 
The Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the federal Clean Air Act to include various metals. The federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.
 
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
 
National Forest Management Act. The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
 
Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA imposes clean-up and reclamation responsibilities with respect to discharges into the environment, and establishes significant criminal and civil penalties against those persons who are primarily responsible for such discharges.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
 
National Historic Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
 
In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we incurred minimal costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in relation to our operating activities.
 
Employees
 
Including our executive officers, we currently have three fulltime employees. Salaries for these three employees are in arrears and are accrued monthly. We also utilize the services of qualified consultants with geological and mineralogical expertise as well as individuals for accounting services.
