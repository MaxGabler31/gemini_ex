 Our product licensing business faces competition from other third-party providers of similar solutions as well as internal engineering and design groups among industry IC provider and consumer electronic manufacturers. 
 In the audio market, our primary competitor is Dolby Laboratories, which develops and markets, among other things, high‑definition audio products and services. Dolby’s long‑standing market position, brand, business relationships, resources and inclusion in various industry standards provide it with a strong competitive position.
 8


In addition to Dolby, we compete in specific product markets with companies such as Fraunhofer IIS and various other consumer electronics product manufacturers. Many of these competitors have a wide variety of strengths that afford them competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, greater resources, greater name recognition, or the ability to offer their technologies for a lower price or for free.  We have historically competed effectively against these competitors due in part to our ability to position our brand as a premium offering that contains superior proprietary technology, the quality of our customer service, our inclusion in industry standards and our industry relationships.
 Our HD Radio and DTS Connected Radio solutions face competition from subscription-based digital service providers such as Sirius/XM, Pandora, Gracenote, and other digital audio and data service providers.
 Our image processing technologies broadly compete with other image processing software vendors such as ArcSoft, Inc., as well as engineering and design groups of mobile phone and digital camera manufacturers that seek to provide similar technologies by employing different approaches. Over time, we expect to see new competitors and other competing technologies emerge.
 Semiconductor and IP Licensing Segment
 The Semiconductor and IP Licensing Segment licenses semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies and related IP.  These technology and IP assets are licensed primarily through our subsidiaries, Tessera, Invensas and Invensas Bonding Technologies. Tessera’s research and development led to significant innovations in semiconductor packaging technology. We patented these innovations, often referred to as chip-scale packaging, which have been widely adopted in the electronics industry. The wave of adoption was initially led by Intel Corporation, and over time, many semiconductor companies and outsourced assembly and test (OSAT) companies entered into technology and patent license agreements with Tessera, Inc.
 Invensas Corporation develops next generation semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies for memory, mobile, computing and automotive applications. For these applications, Invensas innovates in three primary areas: (i) DRAM and NAND , (ii) imaging and RF, and (iii) three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) assemblies. Invensas engineering teams develop and prototype these technologies in advanced assembly and test laboratories, as well as perform product reliability and acceptance testing. Invensas builds collaborative partnerships with world-class manufacturing companies and high-volume equipment and materials suppliers and licenses its technology solutions to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), fabless device suppliers, foundries, and outsourced assembly and test (OSATs) providers.  Invensas also supports the transfer of its technology at customer-designated sites.
 Within each of these three areas of innovation (memory, mobile, and 3D-IC), Invensas has created specific product solutions that address critical needs in the market. For example, Invensas innovates in the 3D-IC space. 3D-IC, which typically includes Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs), is widely expected to be the next major inflection in the semiconductor industry and is applicable to multiple markets, including mobile, computing, data storage, and networking. In August of 2015, we augmented our 3D-IC portfolio with the acquisition of Ziptronix, Inc. (now known as Invensas Bonding Technologies, Inc.), a leading developer of low temperature wafer bonding technologies, which are targeted at the image sensor, DRAM, NAND, RF, MEMS, and 2.5D and 3D-IC markets. Our ZiBond® technology is a low temperature homogenous (e.g. oxide-to-oxide) direct bonding solution that forms strong bonds between wafers or die with the same or different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). ZiBond offers multiple benefits over conventional bonding techniques such as adhesives, anodic bonding, eutectic bonding and glass frit. Bonding is performed at room temperature, which enhances overall yield and reliability by eliminating the negative effects associated with CTE mismatch, warpage and distortion. Higher throughput and lower cost-of-ownership are realized by using industry-standard manufacturing equipment, such as wafer aligners and bonders. Our DBI® technology is a low temperature hybrid direct bonding solution that allows wafers or die to be bonded with exceptionally fine pitch 3D electrical interconnect. Like ZiBond, the DBI alignment and bonding process is performed at room temperature. DBI also leverages industry-standard manufacturing equipment, such as wafer and die bonders, enabling high-throughput, low cost-of-ownership fabrication processes required for high volume market applications. DBI can minimize the need for TSVs by allowing interconnection to occur at the bonding surface, thereby improving electrical performance and reducing cost. By incorporating dielectric bonding, DBI eliminates the need for under-fill while providing excellent thermal performance, reliability and hermeticity.
 Customers
 Our semiconductor packaging, interconnect and other related technologies have been licensed to more than 100 companies. These customers include Samsung, SK hynix, Micron, OmniVision and Broadcom, among others.

Research & Development
 As demonstrated by our industry‑recognized and widely-deployed advanced technologies, we have a long history of developing, licensing and delivering innovative semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions worldwide. Many of our longstanding innovations have enabled core function and performance gains in a wide range of semiconductor devices and electronics products over the years.
 As we have grown, we continue to develop new technologies internally as well as seek to acquire best-in-class technologies from outside sources. Our combination of experienced research and development engineers, our base of technology, and our constant efforts to innovate new industry-leading solutions, provides a strong foundation for the development and commercialization of new and unique semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions going forward.
 Research and development and other related costs for the Semiconductor and Intellectual Property segment were approximately $27.5 million, $30.0 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio
 As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries comprising the Semiconductor and IP Licensing segment owned approximately 1,852 United States patents and patent applications, as well as approximately 1,287 foreign patents and patent applications. The last of the issued patents to expire is in 2037.
 From time to time, we acquire complementary IP portfolios from other leading companies in the semiconductor industry. Our criteria for patent acquisitions include: the fit with our existing portfolios, the number and jurisdiction of patent assets, the technical and legal strength of the patents, the actual or likely adoption by industry, and the economic value of the inventions. See Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors.
 Strategy
 We are focused on the development of advanced semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies to enable the next generation of mobile, consumer, and computing products. Leveraging our extensive design, simulation and prototyping capability, we partner with leaders across the semiconductor ecosystem to develop and commercialize our technologies.  As an integral component of our commercialization effort, we transfer our technologies to customer-selected manufacturing sites, foundries and OSATs to enable our customers to manufacture semiconductor products in high volume.
 Although we are engaged with and have successfully licensed and transferred our technologies to many semiconductor companies, some of the companies that use our patented technologies have nonetheless chosen not to enter into license agreements with us. Consequently, we have initiated litigation to enforce our IP rights. We view litigation as an instrument of last resort and we use it only when our efforts to reach negotiated licenses have stalled or failed. If we are unable to secure license agreements on favorable terms through negotiations, or if licensees do not comply with the terms of their licenses, we might have to file new litigation to enforce our rights. See Part 1, Item 3-Legal Proceedings.
 Competition
 We compete primarily with internal technology development groups at semiconductor manufacturers, foundries, assemblers, and electronic component and system manufacturers, who may create their own solutions that compete with technologies that we license. In general, there may be several ways to solve a particular technical problem and there can be no assurance that our inventions and approaches will be the ones generally adopted by the industry. We also compete with other firms in acquiring patent portfolios. The most significant impediments to our semiconductor and IP licensing business are (1) the time it takes for new technologies to be adopted in high volume production, and (2) the tendency for companies to use our inventions and intellectual property without first obtaining a license from us.
