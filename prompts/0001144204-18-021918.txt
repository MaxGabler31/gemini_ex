ITEM 1.   BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Xspand Products Lab, Inc. (“Xspand”) was incorporated on July 18, 2017 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Idea Lab X Products, Inc. On October 26, 2017, Idea Lab X Products, Inc. changed its name to Xspand Products Lab, Inc. On February 14, 2018, Xspand effected a one-for-3.333333 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. All share information has been retroactively restated to reflect the aforementioned reverse stock split. 
 As of December 31, 2017, Xspand had two wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”): S.R.M. Entertainment Limited (“SRM”) and Ferguson Containers, Inc. (“Fergco”). On September 30, 2017, SRM and Fergco were acquired by Xspand in exchange for an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of Xspand common stock and notes payable aggregating $2,996,500. 
 SRM was incorporated in Hong Kong on January 14, 1981, and Fergco was incorporated on September 14, 1966 under the laws of the State of New Jersey. Our two reportable segments correspond to SRM and Fergco’s business lines: (i) the design, manufacture and sale of a broad variety of innovative toy products sold directly to retailers or direct to consumers via e-commerce in North America, Asia and Europe by our SRM segment, and (ii) the design, manufacture and sale of packaging and packaging materials to industrial and pharmaceutical companies in North America by our Fergco segment. 
 Entertainment Products Business 
 SRM supplies the amusement park industry with exclusive products that are intended to be sold in amusement parks. For over 20 years, SRM has developed, manufactured and supplied the amusement park industry with exclusive products that are often only available to consumers inside the relevant amusement park. SRM principally produces battery-operated products for theme parks and entertainment venues such as Disney Parks and Resorts, Disney Stores, Universal Resorts, Sea World, Sesame Place, Busch Gardens, Merlin Entertainment and Madison Square Garden. SRM has developed products in conjunction with suppliers of products for core licenses such as Harry Potter, Frozen, Marvel and Star Wars. 
 SRM develops and distributes party-related and arts and crafts-related items to retailers worldwide. SRM’s party-related items, such as “The Goodie Gusher” can be found on the shelves of retailers such as Party City and Kmart. SRM’s arts and crafts line of products, sold under the Pirsata Arts & Crafts brand name, can be found in specialty stores such as Barnes and Noble, Land of Nod, Lands’ End and Barneys of New York. 
 SRM develops product strategies in order to bring product concepts to reality, in hopes of ultimately finding retail placement for the fully-developed versions of such products. SRM has developed products such as the WhirlyBall, 20 Minute Dental, Flex Desk, Gripeez, Square Copper Pan Pro, Commando Light, Luma Candles, Dash Cam Pro, Divine Time, Airman, Hair-Drx, Hollywood Nails, Magna Nails, MicroBoom and Mighty Sealer. 
 Products developed by SRM are generally shipped directly to the customer without warehousing at the Company’s facilities. SRM does not have long-term agreements with its customers, and instead develops products on an item-by-item basis subject to purchase orders from its customers. No assurances can be given that SRM’s customers will continue to submit purchase orders for new products. 
 Through SRM, we additionally intend to pursue an acquisition strategy that will allow us to acquire and develop small brands using a combination of shares of our common stock, cash and other consideration, such as earn-outs. Our intended target goal is to use our acquisition strategy in order to acquire ten or more small brands per year for the next three years, most likely commencing such activity in the third quarter of 2018. In situations where we deem that a brand is not a “fit” for acquisition or partnership, we may provide the brand with certain manufacturing or consulting services that will assist the brand to achieve its goals. By partnering, fostering or acquiring existing products and brands whose owners lack the resources to scale their businesses, we believe that we will be able to achieve cost synergies, thereby increasing our own revenue.

  Packaging Business 
 Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Fergco, we lease a packaging and logistics center in Alpha, New Jersey, where we manufacture and sell primarily custom packaging for virtually any product. In our experience, packaging has the capability to “tell” the products story, generating increased product awareness, promote brand image, and drive unit growth. Senior management has more than 100 years of combined experience marketing, producing and delivering packaging materials. A hallmark of our operation is our quick production cycle. We can often begin a production run within minutes of receipt of an order. Many of our products are manufactured from 100% post-consumer recycled material. When production is complete, we typically ship the product using our own trucks rather than relying on a common carrier. Fergco does not have long-term agreements with its customers, and instead manufactures and sells its packaging products subject to purchase orders from its customers. No assurances can be given that Fergco’s customers will continue to submit purchase orders for new products. 
 Fergco is currently in the process of expanding its customer base to include consumer product companies and e-commerce companies. According to AICC, demand for packaging for e-commerce products is forecast to grow more than 10 percent per year to $1.1 billion in 2020, driven in large part by continued growth of online retail sales. 
 With the acquisition of SRM and Fergco, we intend to further Fergco’s efforts to serve consumer products and e-commerce companies by packaging SRM’s products at Fergco’s facility. Furthermore, we believe that Fergco’s packaging will enhance awareness of SRM’s product lines while simultaneously leading to greater operating efficiencies for our combined company. We believe that Fergco’s packaging facilities will improve penetration of SRM’s products at the retail level, in large part because approximately 80% of SRM’s packaging is custom designed, which can be improved through Fergco’s design and production capabilities. 
 Our Market Strategy 
 The process for developing and launching consumer products has changed significantly in recent years. Previously, Fortune 500 and other companies maintained multimillion-dollar research and development divisions to develop and launch products to be sold primarily on retail shelves and supported by large television and print advertising investment. The emergence of e-commerce giants, including Amazon.com has caused retail shelf space to no longer be a requirement to launch a new product. Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter enable solo entrepreneurs to inexpensively produce an advertising video and quickly introduce a new product to many millions of potential customers, and to quickly gain those customers for a low cost of acquisition relative to the cost and time required in prior years as expensive advertising investment is no longer required to gain market awareness. For example, according to Statista.com, crowdfunded sales of products will exceed $18.9 billion in 2021. The consumer shift away from brick and mortar retailers toward e-commerce has resulted in the bankruptcy or downsizing of many iconic retailers which sold toys, including Toys R Us, Sears, Kmart, and K-B Toys, with the resultant loss in shelf space and available locations helping to drive our market opportunity. By utilizing the opportunities to market products over the internet, rather than through traditional, commercial channels, we believe we can reach a much broader market for our brands and products. 
Our Growth Strategy 
 Entrepreneurs can develop and launch products and gain customer adoption and achieve a certain level of scale. However, to grow the business beyond certain scale often requires investment in resources and infrastructure which are challenging to acquire. We can provide these entrepreneurs with our experienced team and sophisticated, scalable supply chain to enable these emerging products and brands to continue to grow. 
 By leveraging our expertise in helping companies launch thousands of new products and our ability to create unique, customized packaging, we intend to acquire small brands that have achieved approximately $1 million in retail sales over the trailing twelve-month period and that are generating free cash flow. In addition, we will seek to elevate the value of these acquired brands by improving each part of their launch process, based on our own marketing methodologies.

  We believe our acquisition strategy will allow us to acquire small brands using a combination of shares of our common stock, cash and other consideration, such as earn-outs. Most likely beginning in the third quarter of 2018, we intend to use our acquisition strategy in order to acquire ten or more small brands per year for the next three years. In situations where we deem that a brand is not a “fit” for acquisition or partnership, we may provide the brand with certain manufacturing or consulting services that will assist the brand to achieve its goals. 
 In pursuit of this acquisition strategy, on February 26, 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership agreement with Edison Nation, LLC, a consumer product development consulting firm that helps first-time entrepreneurs to commercialize their ideas and inventions, which includes a non-binding provision that allows us to negotiate for the acquisition of substantially all of the membership interests of Edison Nation, LLC. As we have not begun to negotiate the terms of such acquisition, there can be no assurances as to when or if we will consummate the acquisition of such membership interests. 
 Manufacturing and Materials 
 To provide greater flexibility in the manufacture and delivery of products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, SRM has concentrated production of most of its products in third-party manufacturers located in China and Hong Kong. Products are also purchased from unrelated entities that design, develop, and manufacture those products. Fergco manufactures all of its products at its Alpha, New Jersey facility. 
 We base our production schedules on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a particular product line. 
 The majority of our raw materials are available from numerous suppliers but may be subject to fluctuations in price. 
 Competition and Industry Background 
 In terms of our toy products business, competition is intensifying due to trends towards shorter life cycles for the development, production and saleability of toy products. Competition is also intensifying due to the availability of online-only distributors, including Amazon.com, which are able to promote a wide variety of toys and represent a wide variety of toy manufacturers, and, with limited overhead, do so at a lower cost. In North America, we compete with several large toy companies, including Hasbro, Jakks Pacific, Just Play Products, Lego, MGA Entertainment, Moose Toys, Spin Master, and VTech, as well as many smaller toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. Internationally, we compete with global toy companies including Famosa, Giochi Preziosi, Lego, MGA Entertainment, Ravensburger, Simba, Spin Master, and VTech, as well as many smaller toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. 
 In terms of our packaging business, we compete against a large number of packaging manufacturers in North America, such as AEP Industries, Inc., Avery Dennison, Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Packaging Corporation of America and Westrock Company. As a custom box manufacturer and a logistics provider, we believe that we offer a differentiated, cost efficient, outsourced, “back-end” to deliver product for emerging companies and brands that struggle to deliver efficiently to customers, and/or to scale as demand for product grows. We believe this value-added fulfillment is a significant component of the future of the packaging industry, and have not observed competitors focusing on this niche. 
 Seasonality 
 Packaging industry volumes have historically been directly influenced by the volume of non-durable goods production. As the toy business is highly seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of all toy purchases during the traditional holiday season, seasonality has significant impact on us. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to our business associated with the

  underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of less popular toys that do not match consumer demand. These factors increase the risk that we may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that our own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers and theme parks manage their toy inventories, we may experience cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause our sales to vary significantly from period to period. 
 E-commerce has partially delinked the association between packaging industry volumes and the volume of non-durable goods production. We intend to expand this flattening of traditional seasonality from e-commerce channels to our toy business as well, including through the continued emergence of crowd-funded “micro brands” that we believe will further delink demand for our products and services from historical demand fluctuation. 
 Product Design and Development 
 We design the substantial majority of our products in-house, and custom design more than 90% of our products for specific customers and their needs. We utilize our existing tooling to produce samples/​prototypes for customer review, refinement and approval. 
Sales, Marketing and Advertising 
 We develop new customer prospects through outbound sales calls, trade show participation, web searches and through referrals from existing customers. 
 Research and Development 
 We often utilize real-time analytics and metrics to forecast response rates, unit volume growth, return on investment and forecast long-term market acceptance for our products. We initially test online response using feedback from our web testing tools, such as Google Analytics. We intend to apply these analytics and metrics to small brands that we may acquire. 
Government Regulations and Environmental Quality 
 Our products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and may also be subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some states. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. Our products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. 
 We maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, we may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. 
 Our advertising is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, The Children’s Television Act of 1990, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as laws of certain countries that regulate advertising and advertising to children. In addition, our web-based products and services and other online and digital communications activity are or may be subject to US and foreign privacy-related regulations, including the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) and related national regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
