General Overview and Current Business
 
We were originally organized as a corporation in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2015, and on November 30, 2015, we acquired a portfolio of mobile software applications for smartphones and tablets (“Apps”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, entered into by and between the Company and the owners of the Apps, Corey Wadden and Saba Mirzaagha, both individuals residing in Ontario, Canada (“Asset Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we purchased the portfolio of Apps from Mr. Wadden and Mr. Mirzaagha for an aggregate purchase price of $60,000 and entered into an employment agreement with each of them. Pursuant to the employment agreements, which are effective January 6, 2016, each of Mr. Wadden and Mr. Mirzaagha are required to devote at least ten (10) hours per week to the Company’s business during their term of employment, which is for a minimum of one (1) year. After one (1) year, either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty (60) days notice to the other party. 
 
Under each employment agreement, we agreed to provide to Mr. Wadden and Mr. Mirzaagha each: (a) five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the first three (3) months following the effective date of January 6, 2016; (b) one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per month thereafter; (c) 150,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock effective November 30, 2015; and (d) an appointment to our Board of Directors. In addition, after the effective date of January 6, 2016, as an incentive payment, each of Mr. Wadden and Mr. Mirzaagha will be paid ten percent (10%) of the Company’s profits (with “profits” defined as the Company’s total revenue minus total expenses) on an annual basis while they are employed by the Company, pro-rated for partial years. 
 
On July 1, 2017, the employment agreements with Mr. Wadden and Mr. Mirzaagha were terminated, and the portfolio of mobile software applications were transferred to Mr. Wadden and Mr. Mirzaagha as part of a debt forgiveness agreement.
 
Our company is currently researching other mobile application opportunities.

Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
We have not ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.
 
We do not have a corporate website.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees. Our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of our company at no cost.

1. | The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 
As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
