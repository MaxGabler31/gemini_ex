Overview
Q2 is a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which financial institutions and other financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We offer our solutions to financial institutions, financial technology companies, or FinTechs, alternative finance companies, or Alt-FIs, and other innovative companies, or Brands, wishing to incorporate banking into their customer engagement and servicing strategies. Our solutions include a broad and deep portfolio of digital banking and lending solutions; an open technology platform, the Q2 Innovation Studio, that accelerates innovation by enabling a partnership ecosystem on the Q2 platform in which FinTechs and other digital solution providers can embed their offerings and customers can develop their own applications; and a comprehensive banking as a service, or BaaS, solution, which we re-branded as Helix in 2022, that enables innovative companies to incorporate banking directly into their products. We purpose-build our platforms and solutions to enable success for our customers and technology partners by allowing them to digitize their operations and offerings, differentiate their brands, and integrate traditional and emerging financial services, ultimately enhancing End-User acquisition, engagement and retention and improving operational efficiencies and profitability.
We have deep domain expertise in developing and delivering secure, advanced digital solutions designed to help our customers and technology partners compete in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. Over 17 years ago Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to regional and community financial institutions. We have rapidly grown since then through a combination of broad market acceptance of our award-winning solutions and relentless innovation, investment and acquisitions. Our portfolio of solutions now spans digital banking, lending, profitability, onboarding, security, and we now serve account holders and borrowers across retail, small business and commercial segments, in addition to our open technology platform and BaaS offerings. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 1,200 financial institution customers using one or more of our solutions, including 40% of the top 100 U.S. Banks, based on total assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had 448 installed digital banking platform customers, and those customers had approximately 19.2 million account holders registered on our digital banking platform. During 2021, End Users logged into our digital banking platform over 4 billion times and executed over $2.0 trillion in financial transactions. In addition, during 2021, our lending solutions were used to price approximately $4 trillion in commercial loans. While we remain focused on our founding mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions and continue to generate a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our digital banking platform, we intend to draw on our broad solution portfolio, deep domain expertise and robust customer base to lead the transformation into a new frontier of financial services.
The financial services industry is undergoing tremendous change, influenced by three major factors. First, financial institutions demand now, more than ever, to digitize their operations and offerings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this digital transformation. Second, the continued growth in the number of FinTechs and the innovation they bring to the market is increasing End-User demand and expectations for new, more engaging and meaningful digital financial experiences. And third, major innovative Brands recognize that incorporating banking into their strategy is an opportunity to leverage the trust that their End Users place in them, driving deeper engagement with those End Users. These three forces are converging to create what we believe is a new frontier in financial services in which financial institutions, FinTechs and Brands will have new roles and interdependencies, and which will require new technology, new partners, and new business models. We believe that lasting value creation in financial services will be achieved by those companies that can support and enhance the convergence of these forces. In addition, we have built a broad set of solutions that we believe equips us to accelerate and optimize this convergence â€“ from digitizing the entire bank, to facilitating partnerships among financial institutions and FinTechs, to enabling Brands to incorporate banking into their products and customer relationships.
We believe this new frontier creates an expanded market opportunity for our business, which we have been thoughtfully building towards for several years. We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. Additionally, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functionality that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of FinTechs, Alt-FIs and Brands. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of solutions includes retail, small business and commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending, relationship pricing, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions among others. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an application-program-interface, or API, based and software-development-kit, or SDK, based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users. We believe our expanded solution offerings and the continued growth of our customer base and market opportunity have increased the addressable market for our solutions to greater than $13.0 billion.
Our solutions utilize a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, delivery model, designed to scale with our customers as they grow their business, add End Users on our solutions and expand the breadth of digital services and solutions they offer. On average, Q2 digital banking platform customers have historically grown contracted revenue by approximately 48% within 36 months of implementation. Our SaaS delivery model is also designed to reduce the cost and complexity of implementing, maintaining and enhancing the digital services and solutions our customers provide to their End Users. 
We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific offerings, workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' and their End Users' data.
We believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party solutions allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings and customer base, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of financial institutions, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us to capitalize on the new frontier in financial services.
We primarily sell our solutions through our direct sales organization and recognize the related revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years. Our digital banking platform revenues generally increase as we add new customers, sell additional solutions to existing customers, grow the number of End Users on our solutions, and increase the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our BaaS arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred. 
We have achieved significant growth since our inception, including the past three years. We had total revenues of $498.7 million, $402.8 million and $315.5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, to grow our business by expanding our sales and marketing activities, adding delivery and support resources aligned 
with our growth, developing and acquiring new solutions and enhancing our existing solutions and technical infrastructure. We incurred net losses of $112.7 million, $137.6 million and $70.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At each of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total assets of $1.4 billion.

Industry Background
The financial services market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. We believe a new frontier has emerged in which financial institutions and other financial services providers will have new roles and interdependencies and require new technology, partnerships, and business models to create differentiation and lasting value. 
The ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and the proliferation and adoption of new, innovative financial experiences offered by FinTechs and other financial services providers are dramatically changing the financial services market.
The ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for innovative digital services have driven increases in the number of financial services providers, greater fragmentation of the financial services market and a broadening set of new and innovative digital financial services. End Users, spanning retail, small business and commercial, expect to transact and engage digitally with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. Financial services providers similarly must be able to digitally manage End Users' financial experiences anytime, anywhere and on any device, with a focus towards improving operating efficiency and enhancing End-User acquisition, engagement and retention. FinTechs and major innovative Brands recognize that incorporating banking into their strategy is an opportunity to leverage the trust that their customers place in them, drive deeper engagement with those customers and generate additional revenue. These changes in the financial services market and in End-User and customer expectations create challenges and opportunities for financial institutions as well as other financial services providers. Financial institutions and other financial services providers are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities by providing a broadening set of new and innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences which better align with the expectations of End Users' experience through digital channels.
Substantial investment over the past several years in FinTechs and the innovation they bring to the market are increasing End-User demand and expectations for new, more engaging and meaningful digital financial experiences. FinTechs and other financial services providers are nimble, focused on innovation and are less constrained than financial institutions by legacy technology solutions, physical branch locations and regulation. By unbundling traditional banking services and delivering them through new, innovative and compelling experiences, FinTechs are making finance more accessible, engaging and easier for End Users. The innovative offerings of FinTechs are having an outsized impact on the financial services industry, creating substantial competitive pressure on financial institutions to offer similarly compelling financial experiences. Accordingly, financial institutions are increasingly seeking to incorporate best-in-class FinTech solutions into their offerings and operations.
FinTechs and other financial services providers, including Brands, face substantial regulatory hurdles and technology dependencies in incorporating banking into their solutions. The financial services offered by FinTechs and other financial services providers often leverage core banking functions, creating an interdependency between financial institutions and FinTechs and other financial services providers. Financial institutions of all sizes provide two fundamental banking functions among others - they hold NCUA-insured or FDIC-insured deposits and they transfer money. Providing these critical banking functions generally requires a federal or state banking charter, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure, and subjects the provider to complex regulatory oversight by various authorities. As an example, electronic payment transactions in the United States, other than wire transfers, are conducted as automated clearinghouse, or ACH, transactions, which settle through the Federal Reserve System in most cases, and generally, only financial institutions can obtain the necessary master account with a Federal Reserve Bank to settle transactions. These laws and regulations have existed for decades, are extremely complex, constantly evolving, and require financial institutions to implement and maintain complex and costly operating policies, procedures and technical infrastructure to protect End Users, their deposits and their personal information. These regulatory constraints provide an incentive for FinTechs and other financial services providers, including Brands, to partner with financial institutions rather than making the significant investments in expertise and infrastructure necessary to obtain a banking charter and otherwise become regulatory-compliant.
The confluence of these challenges and opportunities faced by financial institutions and other financial services providers, including Brands, has created an environment in which cooperation, rather than competition, can be the optimal solution. To more deeply engage with their End Users, financial institutions are increasingly seeking to incorporate best-in-class FinTech experiences into their digital offerings, and other financial services providers are increasingly incorporating banking functionality into their offerings. This convergence of factors and interdependency between financial institutions and other financial service providers is creating what we believe is a new frontier in financial services in which financial institutions, FinTechs, and Brands will have new roles and interdependencies, and will require new technology, new partnerships and new business models.
Security is paramount for digital financial services
The risks of theft and fraud have always existed in banking and financial services. However, as the adoption, use, and breadth of digital financial services offerings has increased, the incidence of fraud and theft in digital channels has grown substantially. The methods by which criminals seek to commit fraud are constantly changing, requiring financial services providers and their technology providers to continually modify their security protocols. In addition, safeguarding the funds and information of financial service providers and their End Users becomes increasingly complex as digital financial services grow and extend across new channels, devices, and services not previously contemplated. Successfully securing the digital financial services of financial institutions, FinTechs and other financial services providers requires experience, constant vigilance, and continuous investment to stay informed and guard against these ever-changing threats.
Digital financial services are highly regulated
Financial services providers and their solutions are subject to extensive and complex regulations and oversight by federal, state and other regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and affect the conduct of financial service providers operations and, as a result, the business of their technology providers. The compliance of digital financial solutions with these regulatory requirements depends on a variety of factors, including functionality and design, the classification of the financial service provider and its services, and the manner in which the financial service provider and its End Users utilize the solutions. In order to ensure compliance with these laws, technology providers and financial service providers may be required to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of their, the financial service providers' and their End Users' information, and to undergo periodic audits and examinations. Maintaining such regulatory compliance becomes increasingly complex as digital financial services grow and extend across new channels, devices, and services not previously contemplated.
Digital financial services are complex and often have limitations
The ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and continued proliferation of digital solutions offered through open development platforms makes it increasingly difficult to provide a consistent, intuitive and personalized End-User experience and requires digital solutions to support new and rapidly changing mobile operating systems and device types. The technical and operational complexities of delivering integrated digital solutions across multiple operating systems, devices, channels, and complex functionality increase the difficulty of providing a consistent, intuitive and personalized End-User experience. Aging or increasingly complex solutions can create the following challenges for financial services providers:
â€¢integrating applications and systems from multiple vendors may increase costs and time-to-market;
â€¢managing relationships with multiple vendors can be time consuming and require a greater investment in business development and support resources;
â€¢building, maintaining and upgrading regulatory-compliant and secure solutions and infrastructure can be expensive and time-consuming and require special expertise that can be hard to find and retain;
â€¢operating, supporting and upgrading systems from multiple vendors can be difficult, costly and less secure and limit the ability to provide a unified End-User experience or comprehensive view of End-User behavior;
â€¢partnering between financial institutions and other financial services providers and innovating and delivering new solutions can be difficult and cost-prohibitive when integration with dated legacy infrastructure is required; and
â€¢training End Users and internal personnel on the use of different point systems can be challenging, time-consuming and costly.
The use of multiple point solutions for digital financial services can require End Users to maintain different login credentials across digital channels and manage different systems. Additionally, the disjointed nature of the underlying workflows, data and terminology caused by the implementation of multiple solutions can lead to decreased End-User adoption, retention and satisfaction. End Users' adoption, retention and satisfaction can also be adversely impacted by the dated End User interfaces of older legacy systems.
The market for digital financial services is significant
We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functionality that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of FinTechs, Alt-FIs and Brands. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of solutions and services now includes commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users.
As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 1,200 financial institution customers using one or more of our solutions, including 40% of the top 100 U.S. Banks, based on total assets. Our financial institution customers span from regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, to global enterprise banks, demonstrating that our portfolio of solutions gives us access to the full spectrum of financial institutions. We market our lending, fraud detection, risk assessment and compliance solutions to all federally-insured financial institutions on a standalone basis, or in combination with our digital banking platform. We market our digital banking platform primarily to RCFIs. To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to result from sales of our digital banking platform to U.S. based RCFIs. We define RCFIs as federally-insured banks and credit unions with less than $100 billion in assets, which according to data compiled by BauerFinancial as of September 30, 2021, consisted of approximately 9,947 financial institutions with combined assets of $8.8 trillion, representing approximately 35% of the aggregate assets held by the 9,977 total federally-insured financial institutions. RCFIs remain critical to our mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions. RCFIs have historically sought to differentiate themselves by providing local, personalized banking services that are responsive to the changing needs and circumstances of their communities. Many RCFIs are locally owned and obtain deposits and make lending decisions on a local basis. RCFIs account for a large portion of small business loans, helping local businesses create jobs and drive economic growth in the communities they serve. RCFIs seek to develop strong, lasting relationships with their End Users and can serve as centers of commerce and influence in their communities.
The FinTech, Alt-FI and Brand markets consist of thousands of financial services providers globally seeking to provide End Users with new and innovative financial services, experiences and solutions. FinTechs and Alt-FIs have received substantial investment, estimated to be greater than $415 billion globally from 2008 through September 30, 2021, with $100 billion invested in the first nine months of 2021 alone, according to Deloitte's web-based Interactive Fintech Funding Report citing Venture Scanner source data. Our Q2 Innovation Studio offerings, which we market to financial institutions and FinTechs, allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to integrate financial services to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and efficiently incorporate the integrated solutions into their offerings and operations. We market our BaaS solutions, which we re-branded as Helix in February 2022, primarily to FinTechs and Brands wishing to incorporate banking into their innovative digital services. We also market our digital lending platform and discrete elements of our digital banking platform to FinTechs and Alt-FIs globally.
Based on our estimates of the number of target financial institutions for our digital banking solutions and our internal assumptions as to the number and types of digital accounts they serve, the prices for our solutions and the number of transactions processed, we believe that the market for our digital banking platform, including retail, small business and commercial banking, as well as digital account opening, account switching, risk management and Q2 Innovation Studio is greater than $7.0 billion. Based on our estimate of the number of target providers of digital lending services and our internal assumptions as to the number of End Users they serve and the prices for our solutions, we believe that the market for our digital lending solutions, including the borrower portal, origination, underwriting, servicing, collections, actionable insights, coaching, negotiation, pricing and sales enablement modules, is greater than $4.0 billion. Based on our estimates of the number of target financial institutions and Brands for our Helix solutions and our internal assumptions as to the number of End Users they serve, the prices for our solutions and the number of transactions processed, we believe the market for our Helix solutions is greater than $2.0 billion. In the aggregate, we believe that the worldwide market for our solutions is greater than $13.0 billion.

The insights made possible by a comprehensive view enable an enhanced, personalized End-User experience, real-time risk and fraud assessment and other analytic features that improve the function and security of our solutions. The breadth of our solutions and quality of the End-User experience they provide enable our customers to increase the frequency and effectiveness of their interactions with End Users. We believe the frequency and ease of these interactions can strengthen the relationships between End Users and our customers and help our customers better serve their End Users through a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior and activities. In particular, we believe that engaging with commercial End Users, involves unique challenges, and by enabling commercial relationship managers with actionable data-driven insights into commercial End-User relationships, they can better serve their commercial End Users, and increase overall performance.
â€¢Drive End-User loyalty: We believe our customers are able to drive End-User loyalty by increasing their level and quality of End-User engagement. Our customers are able to tailor our solutions by offering individually relevant functionality as well as branded, localized End-User experiences. Our digital banking platform and lending solutions provide our financial institution customers with a comprehensive view of operational and End-User activity across channels and devices allowing them to look for opportunities to improve End-User engagement and grow their End-User relationships with targeted offerings based on specific behavior. We believe this further strengthens End-User loyalty by enabling our customers to engage End Users through customized and End-User-friendly digital experiences.

These integration tools connect with a wide variety of third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with our customers' internal and third-party systems and services. We currently maintain over 1,000 integrations to a broad variety of financial services technology partners.

The ease and availability of communications within digital channels also make it easier for End Users to find information about products and services. Our solutions also enable a simplified End-User experience, which can help improve sales of products and services.
â€¢SaaS delivery model: We developed our solutions to be cloud-based. Our customers generally subscribe and pay for their use of our solutions over time, and our solutions do not require our customers to install any significant technical infrastructure. While we host our digital banking platform for substantially all of our digital banking customers, our lending, Q2 Innovation Studio and Helix solutions are hosted with industry leading public cloud service providers. Our SaaS delivery model can reduce the total cost of ownership of our customers by providing the development, implementation, integration, maintenance, monitoring and support of our cloud-based solutions on a subscription basis. Our solutions are designed to support the rapid addition of new services as well as the introduction of new devices and digital channels. As a result, our customers can easily scale the use of our solutions with their needs as they add End Users and expand the digital services and solutions they offer.
â€¢Regulatory compliance: Our solutions leverage our deep domain expertise and the significant investments we have made in the design and development of our data center architecture and other technical infrastructure, including public cloud services, to meet the stringent security and technical requirements on financial institutions and financial services providers. Customers who use our cloud-based solutions are able to satisfy security and technical compliance obligations by relying on the security programs and regulatory certification of our data centers and other technical infrastructure. By doing so, our customers avoid the significant cost and effort associated with building, maintaining and upgrading a regulatory-compliant and secure environment on their own.
â€¢Real-time security: We employ multi-layered controls to help secure our customers' and End Users' information. Each layer addresses specific areas of possible fraud or data vulnerability. Our customers can use transactional-based controls to reduce fraudulent transactions by allowing them to adjust configurations such as transaction values, payment windows or account suspension. Our digital banking platform customers who leverage our Q2 Sentinel product are able to identify and block suspected fraudulent activity in real-time at the application layer, based on machine-learning and behavioral analytics, and notify operations staff and End Users of suspect transactions prior to consummation of a transaction. This approach mitigates and more effectively manages the security risks in financial services and helps protect our customers' reputations. 
â€¢Intuitive design: We design and test the features and End-User experience of our solutions to be optimized for touch-based devices and then extend that design to other digital channels. This design process and our broad feature offerings enable our solutions to deliver a modern, unified End-User experience across digital channels.
â€¢Delivery of robust digital financial services across multiple channels: Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust and integrated digital financial services to their End Users who increasingly expect and appreciate the ability to manage their financial experiences anytime, anywhere and on any device. Through a single log-in and consistent workflow, End Users are able to seamlessly conduct consumer and commercial transactions across digital channels and devices.
Our Business Strengths
Since our inception, our mission has been to help financial institutions strengthen the markets they serve. We are highly committed to this mission, and support it by focusing on designing, developing and acquiring new, innovative digital banking and other financial services solutions to meet changing End-User expectations. We believe we are well positioned to connect and serve financial institutions, FinTechs and other financial services providers, including Brands, as they transform the ways in which they engage, either independently or in partnership, with End Users globally:
â€¢Our purpose-built digital banking platform leads the RCFI digital banking market: We built our digital banking platform to address unique challenges that financial institutions face in providing digital banking services. Our digital banking platform reduces the inefficiencies of traditional point-to-point integration strategies and replaces multiple management consoles with a single unified view of the rules, rights and security involved with operating seamlessly across digital channels. Our digital banking solutions enable our financial institution customers to provide a compelling, unified End-User experience to consumer and commercial End Users using a single login anywhere, anytime and on any device. We believe our deep domain experience as a leading provider of digital banking solutions positions us well to provide new, innovative digital banking and other financial services solutions to address the new frontier in financial services.
â€¢We have acquired and developed solutions to better serve our financial institution customers and a broader set of global financial service providers including FinTechs, Alt-FIs and Brands: Over the past several years, we have expanded our portfolio to include offerings such as lending, Q2 Innovation Studio, Helix, digital account opening, account switching, risk management and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. As the financial services landscape has evolved to become more digitized and open, we have strived to ensure our customers can offer a broader range of digital services to their End Users. 
â€¢Our open technology platform accelerates innovation and enables a new technology partnership ecosystem: We are leveraging the strength of our digital banking platform and broad customer base to open our platform and create opportunities for mutually beneficial partnerships among financial institutions and other financial services providers. To accomplish this, we have opened our digital banking platform via the Q2 Innovation Studio, which makes it easy for financial institutions and other financial services providers to integrate additional functionality into our platform. Financial institutions can deploy their own development resources to supplement or customize their digital offerings and FinTechs and other digital solution providers can integrate their services with the Q2 digital banking platform. Financial institutions can then choose to incorporate these integrated services into their offerings, creating a new technology partnership ecosystem where financial institutions, FinTechs and other digital solution providers can cooperate, generating new revenue opportunities and enhancing End User engagement. 
â€¢We believe Helix has an early mover advantage in serving the rapidly growing market of Brands incorporating banking into their digital offerings: We have been investing in our Helix offerings for several years, and today our Helix platform supports many FinTechs and innovative Brands, serving more than 11 million End Users. FinTechs and major innovative Brands recognize that incorporating banking into their strategy is an opportunity to leverage the trust that their customers place in them, driving deeper engagement with those customers all while generating additional revenue. We believe this opportunity to be in its early stages and given the maturity and adoption of our Helix solution to date and that our Helix solutions were one of the earliest of their type on the market, we believe we have a significant competitive advantage in capitalizing on this opportunity.
â€¢We have a proven track record of providing digital solutions to financial services providers: Our founders and team have a track record of successfully delivering technology for financial services providers. We have deep domain expertise in financial services and community banking, which we utilize to develop and deliver our solutions and services to our customers. We have significant experience and the technical infrastructure to deliver solutions that are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' and their End Users' data.
â€¢Our sales model is tailored to our different markets: The financial institution market is well defined and allows us to effectively focus our go-to-market strategy for our sales and marketing efforts. Utilizing the deep industry experience of our management and sales teams, we are able to leverage our relationships with leaders and influencers at many of our financial institution customers as valuable sources of reference and promotion. We have also developed actionable insights into our sales and marketing performance, enabling us to be efficient with our go-to-market investments. The markets for emerging financial services providers are relatively new, broad and continually evolving. As a result, we leverage our network of technology partners and insights from our experience with financial institution customers to effectively pursue these markets.
â€¢We grow our customer relationships over time: Throughout customer relationships, we employ a structured strategy designed to inform, educate and enhance customer confidence and help our customers identify and implement additional solutions to acquire, engage and retain additional End Users. 
â€¢Our revenues are highly predictable: To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to result from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs. We generally recognize our revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform customer agreements averages over five years. Our long-term agreements and our high customer retention, as well as the growth over time in the number of End Users using our solutions, drive the recurring nature of our revenues and provide us with significant visibility into future revenues. 
â€¢Established financial stability: We generated cash flow from operations for our most recent full-year and expect to show continued improvement in cash flows from operations in the normal course of business over the long-term. Given that some vendors we may compete with have not generated cash flow from operations, we believe our relative financial maturity is viewed as a strength by potential customers as they make their vendor selections. In addition, we feel that our position to generate cash flow from operations affords us with opportunities to invest and pursue our growth strategy, which may not be as easy for companies who are not generating cash flows from operations.
â€¢Our award-winning culture drives innovation and customer success: We believe our award-winning, innovation-focused culture and the location of our operations facilitate recruiting and retaining top development, integration and design talent. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas, which is a vibrant city that continues to attract an increasing number of young professionals and has close ties to leading research institutions. In each of the past eleven years, the Austin American Statesman recognized us as one of Austin's "Top Places to Work." We believe our mission, combined with our focus on delivering leading-edge digital solutions, enables us to attract and retain top talent.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe we are well positioned to connect and serve financial institutions, FinTechs and other financial services providers as they transform the ways in which they engage, either independently or in partnership, with End Users globally and to capitalize on the new frontier in financial services. To accomplish this goal, we are pursuing the following growth strategies:
â€¢Further penetrate our large market opportunity: We believe financial institutions are increasingly adopting cloud-based digital banking solutions. With the ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and resulting proliferation of mobile digital solutions provided through their open developer platforms, End Users are increasingly engaging with financial experiences across a variety of digital channels. Over the past several years, in response to the increasing demand for innovative digital banking and other financial services, we have taken steps to expand our addressable market by acquiring and developing solutions that serve the needs of a broader, global set of financial services providers and their End Users. We have also opened our digital banking platform via the Q2 Innovation Studio, which makes it easy for financial institutions and other digital solution providers to integrate additional functionality to our platform. We believe that our expanded portfolio of solutions addresses a broader set of customer needs, and over the past five years, we have seen the average number of products included in our new digital banking platform deals increase by over 40%. We intend to further penetrate our large market opportunity and increase our number of financial institution and other financial services provider customers using our broad range of digital solutions through acquiring and developing additional solutions, investments in our sales and marketing organization and related activities.
â€¢Grow revenues by expanding our relationships with existing customers: We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing customers by selling them additional solutions. Our broad portfolio of solutions gives us access to decision makers across our customers' organizations. Specifically, we sell distinct solutions targeted for purchase by roles such as head of risk, lending, finance, operations, branding and technology. Additionally, the initial term of our digital banking platform customer agreements averages over five years. This breadth of our portfolio of solutions and the duration of our typical initial digital banking platform arrangement provides us with the ability to better understand our customers' businesses, build trust with them and offer them new ways to acquire, engage and retain End Users. In addition, our revenues from existing customers continue to grow as these customers increase the number of End Users on our solutions and as the number of transactions these End Users perform on our solutions increases. We believe our recent investments in digital lending, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching, the Q2 Innovation Studio and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management, and other innovative solutions will help our customers expand their relationships with us by allowing them to more efficiently sell and market additional services and solutions to their End Users. Our financial institution customers grow their End User bases organically and through acquisitions of other financial institutions.
â€¢Relentlessly innovate to expand our solutions offerings and enhance our platform: We believe our history of innovation distinguishes us in the market, and we intend to continue to invest in our software development efforts and introduce new solutions that are largely informed by and aligned with the business objectives of our existing and new customers. We have rapidly grown through a combination of broad market acceptance of our award-winning solutions and relentless innovation, investment and acquisitions. Our portfolio of solutions now spans onboarding, banking and lending across the retail, small business and commercial segments. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of services and experiences now includes commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users.
â€¢Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments: In addition to continuing to develop our solutions organically, we regularly evaluate strategic opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Centrix, Social Money, Unbill, Cloud Lending, Gro, PrecisionLender and ClickSWITCH. We anticipate that we will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of and strategic investments in technologies that will strengthen and expand the features and functionality of our solutions and provide access to new customers and new markets.

In 2021 we introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, a portfolio of technologies and programs that financial institution customers, FinTechs and other digital solutions providers can leverage to design, develop, and distribute innovative products, services, features, and integrations through Q2's digital banking platform. Q2 Innovation Studio includes an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers, FinTechs and other digital solution providers to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform. Financial institution customers wishing to customize or supplement our digital banking platform solutions may subscribe to the Q2 Innovation Studio and deploy their own development resources, or utilize certified partners, to develop customized services or unique integrations, allowing them to innovate more quickly and to differentiate their brands leveraging our secure digital banking platform. Additionally, FinTechs and other digital solution providers can use the Q2 Innovation Studio to develop integrations of their financial services offerings to our digital banking platform, allowing our broad set of digital banking platform customers to select from a substantial and growing catalogue of pre-integrated technology partners to quickly and easily deploy the latest financial and other services solutions expected by End Users. Q2 Innovation Studio can significantly reduce the time and cost it takes to bring new offerings to market and create new opportunities for customer and End User engagement and retention. We believe Q2 Innovation Studio facilitates a mutually beneficial ecosystem of financial institutions, FinTechs and other digital solution providers, allowing them to partner, generate new revenue opportunities, and enhance End User engagement in the new frontier of financial services.
Helix
Helix, which we formerly marketed as Q2 BaaS, allows FinTechs and innovative Brands to incorporate banking services into their digital offerings, allowing them to easily and efficiently incorporate highly personalized financial experiences within their digital offerings and meet the stringent regulatory and technical requirements applicable to financial institutions and their banking services. Helix combines a cloud-based, real-time core processing platform with the services necessary to support it, including integrated issuer processing, identity verification technologies and the banking services of one of Q2's financial institution partners. These financial institution partners provide the highly-regulated banking services which FinTechs and Brands cannot provide on their own without a bank charter, including issuing accounts and cards, holding and insuring deposits and moving money on the FinTech's or Brand's behalf.
Implementation Services, Professional Services and Customer Support 
We seek to deepen and grow our customer relationships by providing consistent, high-quality implementation services, professional services, advisory services and customer support, which we believe drive higher customer retention and incremental sales opportunities within our existing customer base. We structure our implementation teams to effectively collaborate with the management and technology teams of our customers ensuring the rapid deployment and effective utilization of our solutions. We offer customized professional services to assist our customers with their efforts to extend our offerings and differentiate their brands. In certain cases, we establish more tailored, premium professional services engagements, or Premier Services, with select customers resulting in a deeper and ongoing level of engagement with them. Under certain circumstances for our digital lending solutions, we also partner with third-party professional system integrators to support our customers in the installation and configuration process. These implementation teams develop and execute a coordinated implementation plan for our customers centered around five standard phases of IT transformation projects: initiation, configuration, application testing, limited production and production.
Our customer support personnel serve the comprehensive support-related needs of our customers. Due to the highly-regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry, our implementation and customer support teams, including any third-party professional system integrators with which we partner, must be knowledgeable about our solutions and the regulatory environment in which our customers are required to operate.
Partner Offerings
In addition to our Q2 Innovation Studio offerings, our customers are reliant on an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party digital solutions to complement their financial services offerings and we provide a broad range of tools to help our customers efficiently bring them to market. The flexible nature of our solutions, along with our proprietary, highly flexible set of integration tools, allows us to build rapid integrations with our customers' internal and third-party systems to support End-User activities and customer processes. These integration tools connect with a wide variety of third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with our customers' internal and third-party systems such as account services, payments and imaging. Our ability to integrate with these systems enables our customers to offer a comprehensive set of consumer and commercial functionality to their End Users.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organization is responsible for growing our customer base and maintaining and expanding relationships with our existing customers. We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization but also through partnerships for select solutions and global regions. Our direct sales organization consists of experienced sales professionals who are organized by geography, account size, type of market and whether a prospect is a new or existing customer. Customers are assigned a dedicated representative to provide ongoing assistance in the execution of the customer's digital strategy to meet the needs of its End Users. Our sales representatives are supported by our solutions consulting and sales operations teams.
Our marketing team complements our sales organization through integrated programs for demand creation, pipeline acceleration, customer expansion and brand advocacy. While the financial institution market is well-defined due to the regulatory classification of financial institutions, the markets for FinTechs and other financial services providers are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. We focus our marketing efforts on sponsorships, highly-targeted tradeshows, publications, digital newsletters, digital advertising, account-based marketing, as well as referral agreements with strategic industry partners. Our marketing team also conducts primary research to support our industry thought leadership and to identify emerging trends in End-User behavior and digital activities. Our marketing programs primarily target digital transformation, technology, finance, operations and marketing executives as well as senior business leaders.
Research and Development
Our focus on innovation has fueled our growth and enables us to provide our customers secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which financial institutions, FinTechs and other financial service providers engage with End Users. We allocate significant resources to developing and improving our solutions to meet our customers' evolving needs. We monitor and test our solutions regularly, and we maintain a disciplined release process to enhance our existing solutions and introduce new capabilities without interrupting service delivery. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development and design, including using modern programming languages, data storage systems and other tools. Our multi-tiered architecture enables us to scale, add and modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs and regulatory requirements. Our platform approach supports rapid development and deployment of new features to address evolving market needs. We also enable customers to address their market-specific needs via our extension and integration frameworks, which is a key aspect of our technology strategy. 
Technology and Operations
Due to the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, our digital banking platform combines both multi-tenant and single instance aspects. This structure is designed to maximize End-User data security and minimize compliance cost and risks. Our solutions utilize a multi-tiered architecture that allows for scalability, operational simplicity, security and disaster recovery. We have also developed an internal operations and analytics platform that aggregates and leverages customer instance and End-User experience captured within our solutions to drive future innovation and scale.
We serve our digital banking platform customers from a distributed cloud which combines multiple public cloud vendors and a private cloud consisting of active-active American National Standards Institute Tier 4 datacenters managed by a leading co-location partner. Our digital lending and Helix solutions are hosted by cloud-based hosting services. All of our hosting environments are under a single security posture and compliance stance, allowing us to integrate the various solutions together into a seamless End-User experience, minimizing the impact and relevance of any one component on our combined distributed cloud hosting environment. This configuration provides us with a flexible foundation to support our innovation, allowing us to position services on a piecemeal basis to maximize their performance, scale, cost, resiliency and security.
We utilize prevailing industry configurations to minimize service interruptions, and regularly consider and implement improvements to enhance the resiliency of our services, including our recent improvements to actively distribute services across both data centers. As a result of these improvements, our network infrastructure is fully redundant within each of our data centers, including network teaming to provide network redundancy that includes multiple upstream Internet connections. We have also purchased a private block of IP address space to simplify and expedite our disaster recovery management operations for our digital banking platform customers.
Our digital banking platform has had average uptime in excess of 99.9% since January 2013. We actively monitor our infrastructure 24x7 for any sign of vulnerability, and we seek to take preemptive action to minimize and prevent downtime. Our hosting environments employ advanced measures to ensure integrity and security, from layers of zero-trust network access, design-to-fail architecture, anomaly behavior detection of technical assets, to privileged credential access control. We also use strong endpoint hardening and monitoring to mitigate risk posed by the devices used by our globally distributed workforce.
All End Users of our solutions are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our solutions. End Users must have, at a minimum, a valid user ID and associated password. Many of our customers also employ other authentication methods such as out-of-band one-time password delivery to log on to our solutions and hardware cryptographic tokens to authorize transactions. Our layered security model allows different groups of End Users to have different levels of access to our solutions. Our code is security reviewed multiple times before being deployed into production, our solutions' vulnerability is tested using internal tools prior to release, and an independent third party performs penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions periodically.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secrets and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2021, we had nine U.S. patent applications pending and eight issued U.S. patents, with expiration dates ranging from October 2027 to January 2038. Despite substantial investment in research and development activities, we have not focused on patents and patent applications historically. We license third-party technologies, such as bill pay technologies, that are incorporated into some of our solutions.
Our Competition
The market for digital solutions for financial services providers is highly competitive. We believe that the comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems, combined with our deep industry expertise, reputation for consistent, high-quality customer support, and our unified cloud-based digital banking, digital lending, Q2 Innovation Studio and Helix solutions distinguish us from the competition. 
We currently compete with providers of technology and services in the financial services industry, including point system vendors, core processing vendors and systems internally developed by financial services providers. With respect to our digital banking platform, we have a number of point solution competitors, including NCR Corporation, or NCR, Alkami Technology, Inc. and Temenos AG in the online, consumer and small business banking space and Finastra, ACI Worldwide, Inc. and Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. in the commercial banking space. We also compete with core processing vendors that provide systems and services such as Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., or FIS. With respect to our lending platform, we compete against a number of point system competitors, including Abrigo, Baker Hill Solutions, LLC, Fair Isaac Corporation, nCino, Inc., Finastra, Moody's Analytics, Inc., Brilliance Financial Technology, Oracle Corporation, Temenos AG, and core processing vendors, including FIS and Fiserv. With respect to our Helix solution, we primarily compete with Galileo Financial Technologies, LLC, Marqeta, Inc. and Green Dot Corporation. With respect to our Q2 Innovation Studio, due to the vast number of potential use cases and customer segments, the list of potential competitors is extremely broad and varied, but includes companies across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries.
Some of our competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, may devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and support of their systems than we can, have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, many of our competitors expend more funds on research and development in terms of absolute dollars. 
Although we compete with point system vendors and core processing vendors, we also partner with some of these vendors for certain data and services utilized in our solutions and receive referrals from them. In addition, certain of our customers have or can obtain the ability to create their own in-house systems, and while many of these systems have difficulties scaling and providing an integrated platform, we still face challenges displacing in-house systems and retaining customers that choose to develop an in-house system.
We believe the principal competitive factors for why customers choose our solutions in the financial services markets we serve include the following:
â€¢alignment with the missions of our customers;
â€¢ability to provide a single platform for consumer and commercial End Users;
â€¢ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of products of integrated end-to-end solutions for both account holders and borrowers;
â€¢full-feature functionality across digital channels;
â€¢ability to integrate targeted offers for End Users across digital channels;
â€¢ability to support financial institutions in acquiring deposits with open API technologies;
â€¢SaaS delivery and pricing model; 
â€¢ability to support both internal and external developers to quickly integrate with third-party applications and systems utilizing an SDK;
â€¢design of the End-User experience, including modern, intuitive and touch-centric features;
â€¢configurability and branding capabilities for customers;
â€¢familiarity of workflows and terminology and feature-on-demand functionality;
â€¢integrated multi-layered security and compliance of solutions with regulatory requirements;
â€¢quality of implementation, integration and support services;
â€¢domain expertise and innovation in financial services technology;
â€¢ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
â€¢rate of development, deployment and enhancement of solutions; and
â€¢ability to collect and utilize data generated by our solutions to deliver insights to our customers.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors within the financial institution and other financial services providers markets we serve, but we expect competition to continue and increase as existing competitors continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer support and our business operations generally.
People
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,028 employees, of which 2,024 are full time employees, 1,691 of which were employed in the United States, and 337 were employed outside of the United States. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
At Q2, we view our people and culture as our greatest asset. For more than 17 years, Q2 has been recognized and defined by our mission-driven culture. Our mission is to build stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions. Our people are paramount to our success, and we have always operated with a set of principles to help guide us in how we treat one another, run our business and serve our customers, partners and communities. To ensure our continued success, we endeavor to nurture our mission-driven culture by how we grow our teams, define our goals and reward our employees. Our current programs focus on the following key human capital measures and objectives:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
As a global company, we embrace the diversity of our employees, partners, customers, other stakeholders and the communities we collectively serve. We believe that consideration of differing points of view, including unique backgrounds, experiences and talents, is critical to our success. We are building diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, into our culture with a focus on creating environments and practices that mitigate bias and allow our employees to be their best. Based on information provided by our employees who opted to self-identify, representing the vast majority of our employees, our employee population as of December 31, 2021 reflected the following:

 | Women | Non-White (1)
Overall | 35% | 27% 
Director-level employees and above | 25% | 18% 

___________________________________________________________________________
(1)Excludes the impact of our Bangalore, India operations.
Our DEI efforts highlight:
â€¢promoting an equal opportunity work environment that enables employees to feel safe to express their ideas and perspectives and where they feel they belong;
â€¢building communities within Q2 through employee resource groups, or ERGs, which serve as networks and provide professional development opportunities;
â€¢educating employees and leaders to recognize where bias exists and building practices to combat its impact;
â€¢recruiting, developing and retaining diverse top talent; and
â€¢reinforcing our commitment by supporting external community-based DEI-focused causes and organizations.
In fiscal 2021, our DEI initiatives included:
â€¢hiring our inaugural DEI senior strategist who has been tasked holistically with driving our DEI journey, including developing, delivering and operating frameworks, processes and procedures designed to benefit current and future Q2 team members;
â€¢initiating equity audits, by department, to identify and address potential inequities that are inconsistent with our DEI philosophy and goals, including audits focused on our hiring practices, resource onboarding and vendor selection, among others;
â€¢launching a new leadership training institute targeting our executive leadership team with enhanced DEI focus;
â€¢achieving global pay equity for our female employees;
â€¢publishing our first environmental, social and governance, or ESG, report, which included new disclosure on our DEI progress and initiatives;
â€¢forming our first formal ERGs, focused on underrepresented groups: Black Q2, Women at Q2, and Q2 Pride (LGBTQIA+); and
â€¢enhancing communications to internal and external stakeholders of our DEI commitment, efforts and progress.
We continue to evolve our practices and operating procedures, looking for new ways to identify and eliminate bias and inequities within our organization, including enhanced employee feedback and data collection to supplement our understanding and support of our teams. More than 25% of Q2's team members participated in our inaugural ERG sessions in 2021 and, based on this success, we plan to add additional ERG focus areas in 2022 to create additional connection points for the wide variety of communities within the global Q2 team.
We are also focusing our charitable efforts on new causes with DEI-focused philanthropies, providing opportunities for our team members to learn as well as give back. During 2021, we were fortunate to bring awareness to a variety of important community programs supporting a range of needs, including The Trevor Project which operates the world's largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth, and Homes for our Troops, which builds homes for U.S. veterans in need. Our charitable efforts also focus on causes outside of the U.S., including India-based Srishti Special Academy, which provides special education and training to improve invaluable life skills for those challenged with developmental disabilities. 
Employee Engagement and Culture
Since our inception, our culture has been rooted in our mission to build stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening the financial institutions that serve them. We believe our passion, dedication and commitment towards this mission is a significant differentiator for us with our customers and employees. Our culture is demonstrated and shared through our employee traditions and customs and daily engagements among our employees and with our customers. We continue to refine our employee engagement programs to meet the continued and changing needs of our Q2 team members, including to accommodate a far greater number of remote employees and new hybrid working styles. We offer a range of learning and social opportunities from hosted cooking lessons, exercise programs, book clubs, games and music concerts for frequent, varied ways to engage with our employees.
We live our essential mission of supporting communities through active community support with volunteerism and financial support. We partner with local non-profits that align to our employees' passions with hands-on and virtual volunteering, providing care and impact to communities across the globe. Additionally, we use technology and online tools, such as YourCause, to help promote volunteer opportunities for individual employees and teams. We reward our employees for their service with donation dollars to share back with non-profits of their choice. As an example, in 2021 we launched "Spark: Igniting a Community of Philanthropists" to focus our team members' passion to support non-profits, increase awareness of volunteerism and generate financial support for employee causes. In 2021, despite limitations on our ability to sponsor in-person involvement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team members reported more than 4,000 hours of community service to nearly 150 different causes, and our team members gave more than $275,000 in donations to causes of their choice, which 
Q2 was able to amplify by giving more than $965,000 in corporate donations and sponsorships, including in part through matching employee contributions.
Understanding how our team members are doing is more critical than ever. We are committed to our annual company-wide engagement surveys and thoroughly analyze the results from those, including through the use of third-party analytics, to ensure we hear our employees and understand their input and feedback. Additionally, we conduct pulse surveys at least quarterly to supplement our annual engagement surveys and obtain the latest information and feedback from employees, which helps us more promptly enhance employee programs and benefits. Our leadership team routinely considers the feedback from our employee engagement surveys, both positive and constructive, and focuses on making employee-suggested changes to become an even better place to work. 
Q2 has been an honoree of Austin American-Statesman's "Top Places to Work" for 11 consecutive years and has also been similarly recognized with "Best Places to Work" accolades in our other locations, including Lincoln, Nebraska, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Charlotte, North Carolina, based upon our employees satisfaction ratings. In 2021, Q2 was also awarded a place on the "Top Places to Work USA," based on our employee survey responses across the country.
Our culture is visible across our organization and highlighted through a host of initiatives, programs and committees including the following:
â€¢our portfolio of company-wide events and forums that foster connections to the organization and one another;
â€¢our employee volunteer committees focused on culture, wellness, and charitable causes that help create opportunities for employees to support causes to make a difference in the workplace and local communities; 
â€¢our workspaces and virtual workspace resources that reinforce our mission and guiding principles and promote a collaborative, high-energy work environment that helps facilitate team-based problem solving and cross-departmental learning; and 
â€¢our evolving new-hire employee orientations that help new employees learn about our business, culture, mission and values and be positioned for successful performance in their new roles.
To create a culture of teamwork and rewards, we support a range of recognition programs. One of our most utilized programs is a points-based rewards system that allows our employees to highlight successes and give thanks to individuals and teams across the organization. We encourage the engagement of peer-to-peer recognition and showcase our wins, while we utilize Q2's guiding principles as a framework to recognize the behaviors we expect our employees to model. We provide other meaningful opportunities for recognition that emphasize our commitments to each other and our customers, including our Circle of Awesomeness recognition program which awards our outstanding sales and non-sales employees based on employee and customer nominations with sizable awards, which have included company-paid group vacations and team events among other items. 
Through our sponsorship of Q2 Stadium and our partnership with Austin FC, Austin's major league soccer team, we are also able to extend Q2's philanthropic footprint, through volunteering and fundraising events, and offer meaningful team-building experiences, including:
â€¢support of three central Texas nonprofits targeting underserved communities;
â€¢entrepreneurial sponsorships providing funding to minority-owned startups;
â€¢our 2021 Dodgeball tournament for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, held at Q2 Stadium, that raised $81,000;
â€¢sponsoring and volunteering for Austin's largest blood drive on record, hosted at Q2 Stadium; and
â€¢providing Austin FC game day experiences for over 400 of our employees and a variety of customers and non-profit partners. 
Learning and Development
We recognize the importance of employees developing and progressing in their careers, starting on their first day with our robust new-hire employee orientation and thoughtful onboarding plans, which are designed to give employees a successful beginning of their Q2 careers. Once employees are onboarded, we then look at the ways in which their skills and careers can further develop at Q2. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including a wide variety of development resources and courses through on-demand as well as facilitated learning opportunities. We emphasize individual and team development planning as part of our annual goal-setting process. We believe leading our 
employees is one of the greatest acts of trust we can show to our managers, and accordingly all managers go through training to enable them to effectively perform as leaders. We offer leadership development resources and programs for all leaders at all experience levels, have created leadership competencies based on our guiding principles to help frame our leadership development programs and continue to build tools to continually advance leaders' capabilities to develop and scale their teams. Globally, we are invested in higher education through internship programs that target colleges and universities. In 2021, our 10-week U.S. summer college intern program hosted its largest class yet with 39 students working both remotely and on Q2 campuses across nearly every function for on-the-job learning opportunities alongside targeted curriculum to create an immersive learning experience. 
We offer learning experiences in a variety of formats. We offer role-specific training, ongoing professional skills development and we collaborate with other learning partners to create a wide portfolio of learning resources. Q2 continues to be a presenting sponsor of the annual Texas Conference for Women that allows more than 50 of our leadership nominated employees to participate in the virtual conference. We were also a founding sponsor of the Austin-based African American Leadership Institute and are proud to continue our sponsorship into 2022. 
Talent Acquisition
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with world-class universities, including historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent. We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique mission-driven culture, collaborative working environment, competitive pay structures and exciting growth opportunities to attract talent. We are proud that for fiscal 2021 over 20% of our requisitions were filled internally, utilizing our strong internal talent pipeline as well as building the external talent pipeline needed to support our growth. We leverage multiple resources specifically targeting diverse candidates in our recruiting pipeline, and we are making investments to help us reduce or mitigate any unconscious bias that exists in the recruiting process. We continue to focus on talent development to broaden and enable our recruiting and leadership teams to advise and deploy even more inclusive recruitment practices. 
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward superior employees who must operate in a fast paced, highly-competitive, and technologically-challenging environment, commensurate with their roles and contributions. For our Director-level and above employees, as well as all of our sales and implementations personnel, we seek to do this by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, and where applicable, each individual's contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align such employees' financial interests with the interests of our stockholders, particularly as it relates to our long-term incentive plans. Commencing with our 2022 compensation year, for non-commission employees below the Director level whose roles and contributions are less able to influence the corporate performance measures we typically use to incentivize our more senior employees, we instead allocate what would be their at-market, target bonus percentage to guaranteed amounts, payable ratably over the year, while still factoring company and individual performance into their future advancement and other aspects of their compensation. We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options, and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide-ranging global benefits offered are: 401(k) retirement plan and pension plans, including employer contributions; medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance and pet insurance. 
Employee Well-Being
We are committed to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. In addition to traditional employee benefits, we offer a number of innovative benefits to support the physical, mental and financial health of our employees. These include, among many other things: virtual wellness clinics and classes; online tools that assist employees with their physical and mental health; and special events with outside vendors and participants focusing on employee well-being. We also provide global access to an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) providing our employees and anyone living in their household with access to a variety of resources, including mental health and counseling, work life balance and online legal resources.
