 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, “the Company” or “Southwestern”) is an independent energy company engaged in exploration, development and production activities, including related natural gas gathering and marketing.  Southwestern is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries.  Currently we operate exclusively in the United States.  Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SWN.”
 ﻿
 Southwestern, which was incorporated in Arkansas in 1929 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2006, has its executive offices located at 10000 Energy Drive, Spring, Texas 77389, and can be reached by phone at 832-796-1000.  The Company also maintains offices in Conway and Damascus, Arkansas; Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania; and Jane Lew, West Virginia.  
 ﻿
 Our Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We aim to deliver sustainable and assured industry-leading returns through excellence in exploration and production and midstream performance from our extensive resource base and targeted expansion of our activities and assets along the hydrocarbon value chain.  Our Company’s formula embodies our corporate philosophy and guides how we operate our business:

 Our formula, “The Right People doing the Right Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create Value+,” also guides our business strategy.  We always strive to attract and retain strong talent, to work safely and act ethically with unwavering vigilance for the environment and the communities in which we operate, and to creatively apply technical skills, which we believe will grow long-term value for our shareholders.  The arrow in our formula is not a straight line: we acknowledge that factors may adversely affect quarter-by-quarter results, but the path over time points to value creation.
 In applying these core principles, we concentrate on:

· | Financial Strength. We are committed to rigorously managing our balance sheet and financial risks. We budget to invest only from our net cash flow (supplemented in 2017 by a portion of proceeds from our equity issuance in 2016 that we previously earmarked for capital investment), protect our projected cash flows through hedging and continue to ensure strong liquidity while de-levering the Company. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing Margins. We apply strong technical, operational, commercial and marketing skills to reduce cost, improve the productivity of our wells and pursue commercial arrangements that extract greater value from them. We believe our demonstrated ability to improve margins, especially by levering the scale of our large assets, gives us a competitive advantage as we move into the future. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exercising Capital Discipline. We prepare an economic analysis for our drilling programs and other investments based upon the expected net present value added for each dollar to be invested, which we refer to as Present Value Index, or PVI. We target creating an average of at least a 1.3 PVI in our projects using a 10% discount rate. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments and are reflected in our management compensation. This disciplined investment approach governs our investment decisions at all times, including the current lower-price commodity market. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Dynamic Management of Assets Throughout Life Cycle. We own large-scale, long-life assets in various phases of development. In early stages, we ramp up development through technical, operational and commercial skills, and as they grow we look for ways to maximize their value, through efficient operating practices along with commercial and marketing expertise. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deepening Our Inventory. We continue to expand the inventory of properties that we can develop profitably by converting our extensive resources into proved reserves, targeting additions whose productivity largely has been demonstrated and improving efficiencies in production. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | The Hydrocarbon Value Chain. We often expand our activities vertically when we believe this will enhance our margins or otherwise provide us competitive advantages. For example, we developed and operate the largest gathering system in the Fayetteville Shale area and currently are investing in a water transportation project in West Virginia. We operate drilling rigs and own a sand mine capable of providing a low cost proppant in hydraulic fracturing. These activities help protect our margin, minimize the risk of unavailability of these resources from third parties, diversify our cash flows and capture additional value. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Next Chapter of Unconventionals. Our company grew dramatically in the 2000s by harnessing and enhancing the newfound combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies. Our people constantly search for the next revolutionary technology and other operational advancements to capture greater value in unconventional hydrocarbon resource development. These developments – whether single, step-changing technologies or a combination of several incremental ones – can reduce finding and development costs and thus increase our margins. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovative Environmental Solutions and Policy Formation. We are a leader in identifying and implementing innovative solutions to unconventional hydrocarbon development to minimize the environmental and community impacts of our activities. We work extensively with governmental, non-governmental and industry stakeholders to develop responsible and cost-effective programs. We demonstrate that a company can operate responsibly and profitably, putting us in a better position to comply with new regulations as they evolve. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In early 2016, we faced significant challenges due to a rapid and dramatic fall in natural gas prices, which reduced our revenues and margins.  We implemented the first phase of strategic initiatives, which were designed to stabilize the Company financially.  We suspended drilling and completion activities, reduced our workforce and revised and extended the maturity of our debt while assuring liquidity to pursue our activities.
 When the first phase of these activities was complete, we resumed development activities and entered the next phase, focusing on improving the performance of our large asset portfolio, applying the principles described above.  During 2017, we executed on this part of our business strategy by:

· | Demonstrating financial discipline by investing within our announced plan of cash flow plus the remaining portion of the proceeds from our 2016 equity offering earmarked for this purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Investing only in those projects that meet our rigorous economic hurdles at strip pricing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhancing margins through renegotiation of transportation and processing contracts and expansion of firm pipeline capacity portfolio to maximize realized prices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improving debt maturity schedule through successful $1.15 billion debt issuance, leaving only $92 million in bonds maturing prior to 2022 and no significant other debt maturities expected before December 2020;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delivering operational excellence with improved well productivity and economics from enhanced completion techniques, initiation of water infrastructure projects, optimization of surface equipment and managing reservoir drawdown; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Significantly expanding our proved reserve quantities across our portfolio through our successful drilling program and improved operational performance as well as improved commodity prices.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In February 2018, we announced the next phase of strategic steps, designed to reposition our portfolio, sharpen our focus on our highest return assets, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial performance.  These initiatives include:

· | Actively pursuing strategic alternatives for the Fayetteville Shale E&P and related Midstream gathering assets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identifying and implementing structural, process and organizational changes to further reduce costs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilizing funds realized from the foregoing to reduce debt, supplement Appalachian Basin development capital, potentially return capital to shareholders, and for general corporate purposes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our predominant operations, which we refer to as Exploration and Production (“E&P”), are focused on the finding and development of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquid (“NGL”) reserves.  We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing segment, which we refer to as Midstream.

 Exploration and Production
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs, with our current operations solely within the United States and focused on development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas.  Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania (herein referred to as “Northeast Appalachia”) are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, our operations in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania (herein referred to as “Southwest Appalachia”) are also focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas, oil and NGL reservoirs, and our operations in Arkansas are primarily focused on an unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Fayetteville Shale.  Collectively, our properties located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are herein referred to as the “Appalachian Basin.”  We have smaller holdings in Colorado and Louisiana along with other areas in which we are testing potential new resources.  We also have drilling rigs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas and provide certain oilfield products and services, principally serving our production operations.
 ﻿

· | Our E&P segment recorded operating income of $549 million in 2017, compared to an operating loss of $2.4 billion in 2016. The operating loss in 2016 was primarily the result of $2.3 billion of non-cash impairments of natural gas and oil properties due to decreased commodity prices. Excluding the 2016 impairments, our E&P segment operating income increased $632 million in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to a $673 million increase in revenues, partially offset by a $41 million increase in operating expenses due primarily to increased gathering and transportation fees resulting from a shift in our production growth to the Appalachian Basin. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Cash flow from operations from our E&P segment was $985 million in 2017, compared to $297 million in 2016. Our cash flow from operations increased in 2017 as the effects of higher realized prices and increased production volumes more than offset increased operating expenses. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Oilfield Services Vertical Integration
 ﻿
 We provide certain oilfield services that are strategic and economically beneficial for our E&P operations when our E&P activity levels and market pricing support these activities and we can do so more efficiently or cost-effectively.  This vertical integration lowers our net well costs, allows us to operate efficiently and helps us to mitigate certain operational environmental risks.  Among others, these services have included drilling, hydraulic fracturing, water management and movement, and the mining of sand used as proppant for certain of our well completions.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of seven re-entry rigs and two leased pressure pumping spreads with a total capacity of approximately 72,000 horsepower.  These services provide us greater flexibility to align our operational activities with commodity prices.  In 2017, we provided drilling services for all of our 134 drilled wells and were able to reduce our drilling costs on average by approximately 11%, as compared to recent years. In late 2017, we reinitiated our hydraulic fracturing services and are currently utilizing one pressure pumping spread in Southwest Appalachia.  The majority of our wells in 2017 were completed utilizing third-party hydraulic fracturing services who were offering lower costs.

﻿
 Because our proved reserves are primarily natural gas, our reserve estimates and the after-tax PV-10 measure, or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserve quantities, are highly dependent upon the natural gas price used in our reserve and after-tax PV-10 calculations.
 ﻿

· | Our reserves increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily through extensions, discoveries and other additions in the Appalachian Basin along with increases in both price and performance revisions across our portfolio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | The decrease in our reserves in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to downward price revisions, associated with decreased commodity prices, and our production in 2016, partially offset by upward performance revisions in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | The increase in our after-tax PV-10 value in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher reserve levels, including a significantly larger percentage of oil and NGL reserves. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | The decrease in our after-tax PV-10 value in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower reserve levels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | We operate approximately 99% of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index was approximately 16.5 years at year-end 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The difference in after-tax PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2017 Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.  Our year-end 2016 and 2015 after-tax PV-10 computations did not have future income taxes because our tax basis in the associated natural gas and oil properties exceeded expected pre-tax cash inflows, and thus do not differ from the pre-tax values.  
 ﻿
 We believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value.  Pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, while the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.  We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company’s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes.  We refer you to “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, to the risk factor “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates.  Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and estimated reserve data.

· | As of December 31, 2017, we had 6,855 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, all of which we expect will be developed within five years of the initial disclosure as the starting reference date. During 2017, we invested $23 million in connection with converting 46 Bcfe, or 60%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 into proved developed reserves and added 6,829 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions, primarily in the Appalachian Basin. The significant increase in our proved undeveloped reserve additions in 2017 was the result of adding new undeveloped locations throughout the year through our successful drilling program, improved operational performance and increased commodity pricing across our portfolio.

During 2015, we invested $869 million in connection with converting 1,044 Bcfe, or 22%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014 into proved developed reserves and added 176 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale. As a result of the depressed commodity price environment in 2015, we had downward price revisions of 4,217 Bcfe which were slightly offset by a 733 Bcfe increase due to performance revisions.

  ﻿
 Our December 31, 2017 proved reserves included 1,375 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 330 locations that have a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements but do not have a positive present value when discounted at 10%. These properties have a negative present value of $124 million when discounted at 10%. We have made a final investment decision and are committed to developing these reserves within five years from the date of initial booking.
 ﻿
 We expect that the development costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 6,855 Bcfe as of December 31, 2017 will require us to invest an additional $4.2 billion for those reserves to be brought to production.  Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control.  The current commodity price environment has resulted, and could continue to result, in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce, leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flows.  We refer you to the risk factors “Natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices greatly affect our business, including our revenues, profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets” and “Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.
 ﻿
 Our Reserve Replacement
 ﻿
 In recent years, the Appalachian Basin has provided the majority of our reserve additions.  In 2017, our proved undeveloped reserves in the Appalachian Basin increased by approximately 6.3 Tcfe, as compared to 2016, primarily due to improved commodity pricing.  Our proved developed reserves in the Appalachian Basin increased by approximately 1.2 Tcfe in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to our successful drilling program.  Over the past three years, Northeast Appalachia has contributed 790 Bcf, 81 Bcf and 202 Bcf in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of our reserve additions as a result of successful development activity. Additionally, we added 419 Bcfe, 157 Bcfe and 84 Bcfe of reserves in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of our drilling program in Southwest Appalachia.  We expect our drilling programs in the Appalachian Basin to continue to be the primary source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability to add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control.  We refer you to the risk factors “Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business” and “If we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to grow or sustain production.” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

 Of the acreage we hold in the Fayetteville Shale, the Ozark Highlands Unit accounts for 158,231 acres and lies entirely within the Ozark National Forest.  Following the commencement of two court actions, which were subsequently consolidated, alleging deficiencies in the Environmental Impact Statement issued in connection with the grant of the leases by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Ozark National Forest, the BLM discontinued approval of operational permits in the forest, including permits to drill, pending resolution of the litigation.  Although the case was dismissed in May 2017, the BLM is not issuing drilling permits.  If and when permit issuance resumes, the leases will expire unless, within nine months, we commence drilling or resume rental payments. At year-end 2017, after excluding our acreage in the conventional Arkoma Basin and the federal acreage we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit, approximately 99% of our 533,299 total net leasehold acres remaining in the Fayetteville Shale was held by production.  For more information about our acreage and well count, we refer you to “Properties” in Item 2 of Part I of this Annual Report.  We also refer you to the risk factor “Certain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.
 ﻿
 In February 2018, we announced an initiative to actively pursue strategic alternatives for the Fayetteville Shale E&P and related Midstream gathering assets.
 ﻿
 Other
 ﻿
 Excluding 2,518,519 acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a moratorium since 2015, we held 369,236 net undeveloped acres for the potential development of new resources as of December 31, 2017.  This compares to 492,389 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2016 and 1,142,856 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2015, excluding the New Brunswick acreage.
 ﻿
 We limited our activities in areas beyond our assets in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale during 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of the commodity price environment as we focused on these more proven development plays. There can be no assurance that any prospects outside of our development plays will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments.  
 ﻿
 New Brunswick, Canada.  In March 2010, we successfully bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of New Brunswick to search and conduct an exploration program covering 2,518,519 net acres in the province in order to test new hydrocarbon basins.  In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until it is satisfied with a list of conditions.  In response to this moratorium, the Company requested and was granted an extension of its licenses to March 2021.  In May 2016, the provincial government announced that the moratorium would continue indefinitely.  Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to develop these assets.  Given this development, we recognized an impairment of $39 million, net of tax, associated with our investment in New Brunswick in the second quarter of 2016.
 ﻿
 Acquisitions and Divestitures
 ﻿
 In September 2016, we sold approximately 55,000 net acres in West Virginia for approximately $401 million.  As of December 2015, these assets included approximately 11 Bcfe of proved reserves.
 ﻿
 In May 2015, we sold conventional oil and gas assets located in East Texas and the Arkoma Basin for approximately $211 million.  As of December 2014, these assets included approximately 184 Bcf of proved reserves.
 ﻿
 In April 2015, we sold our gathering assets located in Bradford and Lycoming counties in northeast Pennsylvania for approximately $489 million.  The assets included approximately 100 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines with nearly 600 million cubic feet per day of capacity.
 ﻿
 In January 2015, we acquired approximately 46,700 net acres in northeast Pennsylvania for $270 million. As part of this transaction, we also received firm transportation capacity of 260 million cubic feet per day predominately on the Millennium pipeline.
 ﻿
 In December 2014, we acquired approximately 413,000 net acres in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania with plans to target the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales for approximately $5.0 billion.  Additionally, in January 2015, we acquired an additional approximate 30,000 net acres in this area for $357 million.

  ﻿
 Sales of natural gas, oil and NGL production are conducted under contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings.  We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our production.  We regularly enter into various derivative and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected production to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. 
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, we had the following commodity price derivatives in place on our targeted future production:

  ﻿
 We intend to financially protect pricing on a large portion of expected future production volumes designed to assure certain desired levels of cash flow.  We refer you to Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,” for further information regarding our derivatives and risk management as of December 31, 2017.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 During 2017, the average price we received for our natural gas production, excluding the impact of derivatives, was approximately $0.88 per Mcf lower than average New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, prices.  Differences between NYMEX and price realized are due primarily to locational differences and transportation cost.     ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, we have partially mitigated the volatility of basis differentials by protecting basis on approximately 182 Bcf and 70 Bcf of our 2018 and 2019 expected natural gas production, respectively, through physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas price of approximately ($0.25) per MMBtu and ($0.31) per MMBtu for 2018 and 2019, respectively. 
 ﻿
 We have also financially protected basis on approximately 44 Bcf and less than 1 Bcf of our 2018 and 2019 expected natural gas production, respectively, at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas price of approximately ($0.48) per MMBtu and ($0.59) per MMBtu for 2018 and 2019, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.
 ﻿
 We refer you to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities.
 ﻿
 Delivery Commitments. As of December 31, 2017, we had natural gas delivery commitments of 408 Bcf in 2018 and 100 Bcf in 2019 under existing agreements. These amounts are well below our expected 2018 natural gas production from Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale and expected 2019 production from our available reserves, which are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our

 control that may affect our ability to meet our contractual obligations other than those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part I of this Annual Report.  We expect to be able to fulfill all of our short-term and long-term contractual obligations to provide natural gas from our own production of available reserves; however, if we are unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our obligations.
 ﻿
 Customers. Our E&P production is marketed primarily by our Midstream segment.  Our customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, two subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell Plc in aggregate accounted for approximately 10.3% of total natural gas, oil and NGL sales.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no single third-party purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas, oil and NGL production.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 All phases of the natural gas and oil industry are highly competitive.  We compete in the acquisition and disposition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production and sale of natural gas and oil, its gathering and transportation (whether we are shipping or operate the transmission facilities) and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct our operations. Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies, individual producers and operators and developers of gathering and transportation systems.  Many of these competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those available to us.  Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer.  We also face competition in accessing pipeline and other services to transport our product to market, particularly in the northeastern United States, where potential production levels exceed currently available capacity. Likewise, there are substitutes for the commodities we produce, such as other fuels for power generation, heating and transportation, and those markets in effect compete with us.
 ﻿
 We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms initiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, or any new energy legislation or regulations will achieve the goal of increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing transparency in markets in which our natural gas production is sold.  Similarly, we cannot predict whether legal constraints that have hindered the development of new transportation infrastructure, particularly in the northeastern United States, will continue.  However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other natural gas and oil producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other legislative or regulatory body or the status of the development of transportation facilities.
 ﻿
 Regulation
 ﻿
 Producing natural gas and oil resources and transporting and selling production historically have been heavily regulated.  For example, state governments regulate the location of wells and establish the minimum size for spacing units.  Permits typically are required before drilling.  State and local government zoning and land use regulations may also limit the locations for drilling and production.  Similar regulations can also affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market.  In addition, various suppliers of goods and services may require licensing.
 ﻿
 Currently in the United States, the price at which natural gas, oil or NGLs may be sold is not regulated.  Congress has imposed price regulation from time to time, and there can be no assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach will continue.  In December 2015, the federal government repealed a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil.  The export of natural gas continues to require federal permits.  Broader freedom to export could lead to higher prices.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the rules that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, the SEC, and certain other regulators have issued thereunder regulate certain swaps, futures and options contracts in the major energy markets, including for natural gas, oil and NGLs.
     Producing and transporting natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation.  We refer you to “Other — Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

 Midstream
 ﻿
 Through our affiliated midstream subsidiaries, we engage in marketing and natural gas gathering activities which primarily support our E&P operations. We generate revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs.  Our Midstream segment complements our E&P initiatives and, in some areas, competes with other midstream providers for unaffiliated business.

 Gas Gathering
 ﻿
 Since the sale of our gathering assets in northeast Pennsylvania and Texas in 2015, our gathering assets are concentrated in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas. At the end of 2017, we had approximately 2,045 miles of pipe from the individual wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment representing in aggregate approximately 377,070 horsepower that had been installed at 58 central point gathering facilities in the Fayetteville Shale.  In February 2018, we announced an initiative to actively pursue strategic alternatives for the Fayetteville Shale E&P and related Midstream gathering assets.

 Marketing
 ﻿
 We attempt to capture opportunities related to the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs primarily involving the marketing of our own equity production and that of royalty owners in our wells.  Additionally, we manage portfolio and basis risk, acquire transportation rights on third-party pipelines and in limited circumstances, purchase third-party natural gas to fulfill commitments specific to a geographic location.
 ﻿
 Northeast Appalachia. Our transportation portfolio in Northeast Appalachia is highly-diversified and structured to capture improving northeast basis differentials, which we expect to enhance our margins in 2018, and allows us to access premium city-gate markets as well as deliveries across the greater Appalachia area down to the southeast United States.  The capacity agreements contain multiple extension and reduction options that allow us to right-size our transportation portfolio as needed for our production or to capture future market opportunities.  The table below details our firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 27, 2018:

Total firm takeaway – Northeast Appalachia | 1,450,000 | 1,449,000 | 1,398,000

  ﻿
 Southwest Appalachia. Our transportation portfolio for all products in Southwest Appalachia allows us to capitalize on strengthening markets and provides a path for production growth.  Over the next four years, agreements with ET Rover Pipeline LLC and Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.’s Mountaineer Xpress and Gulf Xpress pipelines will allow us to access high-demand markets along the Gulf Coast while also capturing materially improving in-basin pricing.  In addition to our natural gas transportation, we have ethane take-away capacity that provides direct exposure to Mont Belvieu pricing.  New ethane cracker demand and export capacity is expected to further strengthen ethane pricing.  The table below details our firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 27, 2018:

  ﻿
 Fayetteville Shale. Our transportation portfolio in the Fayetteville Shale allows our production to be sold in markets located from central Arkansas to highly sought after Gulf Coast markets.  In 2017, we took steps to right-size this capacity by restructuring our transportation agreements with Texas Gas Transmission, LLC.  The new agreements were approved by the FERC and, effective November 1, 2017, reduced our Fayetteville Lateral volume commitment from 800,000 MMBtu per day to 100,000 MMBtu per day from November 2017 to October 2020 at existing rates, restructured firm transportation agreements and demand fees beginning in 2021 on 550,000 MMBtu per day of contracted volumes, reducing annually through 2030, at a rate of approximately $0.10 per MMBtu.  Additionally the agreements provided for firm transportation of all volumes between the contracted firm amount up to 800,000 MMBtu per day each year starting in 2021.  This amendment of our agreements provides fixed rate, guaranteed long-term takeaway capacity for our Fayetteville production.  A competitor of Texas Gas Transmission has sought review of the FERC’s order, and although we cannot predict with certainty the outcome, we do not expect the order to be overturned.  The table below details our firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 27, 2018:

 Demand Charges
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, our obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $3.0 billion of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts. We also have guarantee obligations of up to $832 million of that amount.

 We refer you to Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies” in the consolidated financial statements for further details on our demand charges and the risk factor “We have made significant investments in pipelines and gathering systems and contracts and in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and sand mine operations, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our exploration and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 Our marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities.  We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users.
 ﻿
 Customers
 ﻿
 Our marketing customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, two subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell Plc in aggregate accounted for approximately 10.3% of total natural gas, oil and NGL sales.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no single third-party purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas, oil and NGL production.
 ﻿
 Regulation
 ﻿
 The transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs is heavily regulated.  Interstate pipelines must obtain authorization from the FERC to operate in interstate commerce, and state governments typically must authorize the construction of pipelines for intrastate service.  The FERC currently allows interstate pipelines to adopt market-based rates; however, in the past the FERC has regulated pipeline tariffs and could do so again in the future.  State tariff regulations vary.  Currently, all pipelines we own are intrastate.
 ﻿
 State and local permitting, zoning and land use regulations can affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market, and the lack of new pipeline capacity can limit our ability to reach relevant markets for the sale of the commodities we produce.  In addition, various suppliers of goods and services to our midstream business may require licensing.
 ﻿
 The transportation of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation.  We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.
 ﻿
 Other
 ﻿
 Our other operations have historically consisted of limited real estate development activities and a natural gas vehicles (“NGV”) fueling station in Damascus, Arkansas, which was sold in May 2016.  We currently have no significant business activity outside of our E&P and Midstream segments. 
 ﻿
 Environmental Regulation
 ﻿
 General.  Our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  These laws and regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters.  We maintain insurance for costs of clean-up operations in limited instances arising out of sudden and accidental events, but otherwise we are not fully insured against all such risks.  Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance 

 
19


  Table of Contents

 Index to Financial Statements

 that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs.
 ﻿
 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief.  Certain laws and legal principles can make us liable for environmental damage to property we have sold, and although we generally require purchasers to assume that liability, there is no assurance that they will have sufficient funds should a liability arise.  Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes may result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements.  We do not expect continued compliance with existing requirements to have a material adverse impact on us, but there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future.  
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject.
 ﻿
 Certain U.S. Statutes.  CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  
 ﻿
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.”  However, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been considered from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements.  If such measures were to be enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs.  Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. 
 ﻿
 The Clean Water Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into regulated waters.  Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances.  The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges.  Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. 
 ﻿
 The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or OPA, and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in regulated waters.  A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located.  OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages.  Although liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation.  If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply.  Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA.  OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.  In 2017 oil accounted for 2% of our total production, compared to 2% of our total production for 2016 and less than 1% of our total production for 2015, although we expect this percentage to increase as we continue to develop our Southwest Appalachia assets.
 ﻿
 We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil.  Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control.  These properties and the wastes disposed on them may be subject to CERCLA, the Clean 

 
20


  Table of Contents

 Index to Financial Statements

 Water Act, RCRA and analogous state laws.  Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination. 
 ﻿
 The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts emissions into the atmosphere.  Various activities in our operations, such as drilling, pumping and the use of vehicles, can release matter subject to regulation.  We must obtain permits, typically from local authorities, to conduct various activities.  Federal and state governmental agencies are looking into the issues associated with methane and other emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce.  Although methane emissions are not currently regulated at the federal level, we are required to report emissions of various greenhouse gases, including methane. 
 ﻿
 The Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction.  Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining drilling and other permits and may include restrictions on road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats.  Based on the species that have been identified to date, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our operations at this time.
 ﻿
 Hydraulic Fracturing.  We utilize hydraulic fracturing in drilling wells as a means of maximizing their productivity.  It is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids from dense and deep rock formations.  Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
 ﻿
 In the past few years, there has been an increased focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practice, both in the United States and abroad.  In the United States, hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, issued final rules effective as of October 15, 2012 that subject oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAPS programs.  In May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations.  The EPA also finalized pretreatment standards that would prohibit the indirect discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works.  Based on our current operations and practices, management believes such newly promulgated rules will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view may change in the future.
 In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices.  A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.  For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.  The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations.
 Although the current federal administration has relaxed many regulations adopted in the latter part of the prior administration, some states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.  In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of wells.

 Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process has led to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.  Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.  The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We refer you to the risk factor “We are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.
 ﻿
 In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities.  We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations, subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others.
 ﻿
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions.  In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources.  Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established on a case-by case basis.  One of our subsidiaries operates compressor stations, which are facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements.  EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.
 The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations.  Although Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years.  In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs.  Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved.  These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.
 The adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations.  In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  At the same time, new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which is increasing demand.
 Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the “Paris Agreement”).  The Paris Agreement entered into effect in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement.  In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or a separate agreement.  In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.  The Paris Agreement provides for a four year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020.  The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.  To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.
 ﻿
 Employee health and safety. Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes
