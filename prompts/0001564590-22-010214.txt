Item 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company seeking to redefine the power of small molecules to control the expression of genes. Based on our unique ability to elucidate regulatory regions of the genome, we aim to develop medicines that provide a profound benefit for patients with diseases that have eluded other genomics-based approaches. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from mutations of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and building a clinical stage pipeline of gene control medicines.
 Our lead product candidates are:
  
• | Tamibarotene, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RARα, agonist for which we are conducting SELECT-MDS-1, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or HR-MDS, and for which we are conducting SELECT-AML-1, a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy;

• | SY-2101, a novel oral form of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, which we are evaluating in a dose confirmation study, and which we plan to follow with a Phase 3 clinical trial, in patients with newly diagnosed low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SY-5609, a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, that we are evaluating in combination with chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer patients in an expansion cohort of our existing Phase 1 clinical trial, and which we plan to evaluate as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies, and in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial sponsored by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, or Roche.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also have multiple preclinical and discovery programs in oncology, including programs targeting the inhibition of CDK12, CDK11, and WRN. We expect that our next development candidate will be nominated from our CDK12 program in the second half of 2022. In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., or GBT, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We also use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018, under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.
 Tamibarotene
 At the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2020, or ASH 2020, we presented data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy, as well as in relapsed or refractory, or R/R, AML patients who have been prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA, the gene that codes for RARα, biomarker. As of an October 1, 2020 data cut-off, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including both RARA-positive and RARA-negative patients, were eligible for a safety analysis. Among these patients, tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single-agent azacitidine. As of the data cut-off, of the 18 RARA-positive patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 67%, with a composite complete response rate of 61%, with 50% of patients achieving complete response, or CR, and 11% achieving a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi. The median time to initial response was 1.2 months, the median duration of response was 10.8 months, and the median overall survival, or OS, among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18 months. As of the data cut-off, of the 28 RARA-negative patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the ORR was 43%, with a composite complete response rate of 32%, with 25% of patients achieving CR and 7% achieving CRi. The median time to initial response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of response was 10.3 months. We also presented translational data demonstrating that most RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients enrolled in our Phase 2 study had a monocytic disease phenotype that is associated with resistance to venetoclax. These data suggest that the RARA biomarker not only selects for patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with tamibarotene but also for patients who may be less likely to benefit from treatment with venetoclax. Approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with unfit AML in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the overall total addressable market opportunity for all AML patients to grow to approximately $6.6 billion by 2025.

Based on these data and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we advanced tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine into a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients, which we refer to as SELECT-MDS-1. HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy that is closely related to AML, and as in AML, about 30% of HR-MDS patients are RARA-positive. We believe that approximately 21,000 patients are diagnosed with HR-MDS in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the total addressable market opportunity for MDS patients of all risk groups to grow to approximately $3.3 billion by 2026. We plan to enroll approximately 190 RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial, randomized 2:1 to receive tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine or placebo with azacitidine, respectively. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the CR rate. The trial is designed with 90% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.025 to detect a difference in CR rates between the experimental and control arms. We are currently dosing patients in SELECT-MDS-1, and we expect to report data from the SELECT-MDS-1 trial in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024, with a potential submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of a new drug application, or NDA, expected in 2024. In addition, we are advancing tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. The trial, which we refer to as SELECT-AML-1, is designed with a single-arm safety lead-in of approximately 15 patients to confirm the dosing regimen of the triplet to be used in the randomized portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients randomized 1:1. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the composite CR rate. The trial will also evaluate the triplet as a salvage strategy for patients in the control arm who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine. We have begun dosing patients in the SELECT-AML-1 trial, and we expect to report clinical activity data from the safety lead-in portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
 SY-2101
 In December 2020, we acquired from Orsenix, LLC, or Orsenix, a novel oral form of ATO, which we refer to as SY-2101. SY-2101 is in development for the treatment of APL, a subtype of AML defined by a fusion of the RARA and promyelocytic leukemia, or PML, genes. APL represents approximately 10% of all AML cases, and approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with APL in the United States and Europe annually. An intravenously administered, or IV, formulation of ATO is approved for use in combination with All-Trans-Retinoic-Acid, or ATRA, in patients with newly diagnosed low-risk APL and, while curative in more than 80% of patients, its administration requires up to 140 two- to four-hour infusions over the typical course of induction and consolidation treatment. If SY-2101 demonstrates comparable efficacy to IV ATO in our clinical studies, we believe it has the potential to become the standard-of-care frontline therapy for APL by providing a substantially more convenient option that reduces the treatment burden on patients, improving access, and lowering costs to the healthcare system. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, SY-2101 demonstrated bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, exposures similar to IV ATO, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We have begun dosing patients in a dose confirmation study of SY-2101. The ongoing dose confirmation study is evaluating the PK, food effect, safety and tolerability of SY-2101 and is expected to enroll between six and 24 adult APL patients undergoing consolidation with IV ATO plus ATRA. Participants receive a single dose of 15 mg of SY-2101 in both the fasted and in the fed state, and a single dose of IV ATO for PK assessments, with flexibility to allow for other SY-2101 doses to be evaluated. Daily administration of SY-2101 is also being evaluated in a multiple-dose treatment module substituting for IV ATO during consolidation to assess steady state SY-2101 PK and safety.​ We anticipate reporting PK and safety data in mid-2022. The feedback from a Type C meeting to review our Phase 3 study design with the FDA in November 2021 continues to support molecular complete response rate as the primary endpoint for accelerated approval and event free survival as the primary endpoint for full approval, in each case compared to historic IV ATO data. In addition, FDA feedback supports the inclusion of patients randomized to IV ATO for comparative safety assessments.  Based on this feedback and following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates comparable PK exposures to IV ATO, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in approximately 215 patients with newly diagnosed low-risk APL, randomized 2:1 to receive SY-2101 or IV ATO, in the first quarter of 2023, and to announce data from the Phase 3 clinical trial in 2025. 
 SY-5609
 At the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress held in September 2021, or ESMO 2021, we presented data from the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 multi-center, open-label study of SY-5609 evaluating patients with advanced breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, as well as patients with solid tumors of any histology harboring Rb pathway alterations. Patients were treated in cohorts exploring continuous daily dosing as well as intermittent dosing regimens, including seven days on treatment and seven days off, or 7d on/7d off, and five days on treatment and two days off, or 5d on/2d off. As of a July 6, 2021 data cut-off, 54 patients treated with single-agent SY-5609 in the study were eligible for a safety analysis and 45 patients were evaluable for clinical response. The median age of patients enrolled in the study was 65.5. Patients had been heavily pre-treated with as many as eight prior therapies and a median of four prior therapies. Across all doses and schedules, the majority of adverse events, or AEs, were low-grade and reversible, and there was a low rate of discontinuations due to AEs. The most common treatment-emergent AEs were gastrointestinal (nausea, 
 5
 

diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting), fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Tolerability was optimized with the 7d on/7d off schedule, which had the lowest rates of treatment-emergent AEs relative to other regimens, while demonstrating comparable rates of stable disease, or SD, as seen with more dose-intense regimens, supporting the selection of this schedule for further development of SY-5609. The maximum tolerated dose of the 7d on/7d off schedule has not yet been reached as of the data cut-off date. Changes in POLR2A mRNA expression, a pharmacodynamic marker for CDK7 inhibition, were associated with anti-tumor activity and were sustained for at least three days following drug cessation, supporting intermittent dosing. As of the data cut-off date, thirteen response-evaluable patients (29%) had achieved SD, with tumor regressions of up to 20% in six of those patients, across multiple tumor types. The most substantial clinical activity was observed in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, for which five of 13 (39%) evaluable patients achieved SD, with tumor reductions in two of those SD patients. Further, reductions in the CA 19-9 tumor marker, which is used in clinical practice to monitor tumor progression, were observed in three of four pancreatic cancer patients with serial CA 19-9 data, with these reductions ranging from 32% to 72%. Notably, one metastatic pancreatic cancer patient who had failed two prior lines of therapy and relapsed after a third line of treatment experienced prolonged SD of up to ten months. The analysis of clinical activity by tumor type and mutational status supported the mechanistic rationale for SY-5609 in Rb-altered and KRAS-mutant cancers.
 
We also presented preclinical data at ESMO 2021 evaluating the anti-tumor and PD activity of intermittent dosing regimens for SY-5609, as well as preclinical data evaluating SY-5609 as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer models. Taken together, these data further support our dose expansion strategy, including the decision to use a 7d on/7d off dosing schedule and combine with chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.
 
Based on these data, we intend to further develop SY-5609 by exploring indications with compelling clinical and/or preclinical activity, as well as a strong mechanistic rationale and high unmet need. We have initiated an expansion cohort that includes two arms evaluating SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The cohort is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in first or second relapse who have progressed following first-line treatment with the chemotherapy regimen known as FOLFIRINOX, with one arm exploring a doublet regimen of SY-5609 in combination with gemcitabine and the other arm exploring a triplet regimen of SY-5609 with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. SY-5609 will be administered 7d on/7d off at a starting dose of 4 mg, and the combination agents will be administered at the approved doses. The study will evaluate safety and tolerability, as well as efficacy measures such as disease control rate and progression free survival. We expect to report clinical activity data of SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy from the safety lead-in portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
 
We also plan to evaluate the potential of SY-5609 in hematologic malignancies. Based on mechanistic rationale and preclinical data, which support the potential of CDK7 inhibition in a broad range of blood cancers, we plan to initially evaluate SY-5609 as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies. The Phase 1 trial is expected to begin in the second half of 2022, with initial data expected mid-2023, which will inform further development in specific hematologic cancers. The endpoints for this study will include safety, tolerability, and clinical activity measures.
 In addition, in August 2021, we announced entry into a clinical supply agreement with Roche, pursuant to which we agreed to supply SY-5609 for a combination dosing cohort with atezolizumab in Roche’s ongoing Phase 1/1b INTRINSIC trial, which is evaluating multiple targeted therapies or immunotherapy, including atezolizumab, as single agents or in rational specified combinations in molecularly defined subsets of colorectal cancer patients. SY-5609 will be evaluated in combination with atezolizumab in patients with BRAF-mutant disease, and Roche plans for this arm of the trial to be open for enrollment in the first half of 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, Roche will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1/1b study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination of SY-5609 and atezolizumab and will assume all costs associated with the study. In exchange for providing SY-5609, we will receive access to the data on SY-5609 in combination with atezolizumab. We retain all rights to SY-5609.
 Our Strategic Priorities
 We intend to achieve our goal of becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company by focusing on three strategic priorities: building a leading portfolio of targeted therapies for hematologic disorders, which includes two clinical stage product candidates, tamibarotene and SY-2101; building on our leadership in selective CDK inhibition for difficult-to-treat cancers, which includes our clinical stage product candidate SY-5609 and our discovery programs related to selective CDK12 and CDK11 inhibition; and leveraging our gene control platform, along with our expertise in regulatory genomics, disease biology, and transcriptional chemistry, to fuel our pipeline of therapies targeting disease-causing alterations in gene expression.

Our Targeted Hematology Portfolio
 We are advancing two clinical-stage drug candidates, tamibarotene and SY-2101, across three genomically defined patient populations in HR-MDS, AML and APL. Together, we believe these programs provide us the opportunity to address high unmet medical needs of patients with targeted therapies for hematologic disorders.
Tamibarotene
 Overview
 Tamibarotene is an oral, potent and selective agonist of the transcription factor RARα. At ASH 2020, we presented data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in 22 RARA-positive newly diagnosed AML patients who are “unfit,” meaning that they are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy, who were prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA biomarker, as well as in 29 RARA-negative newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. The RARA-negative patients were enrolled to support the development of a commercial companion diagnostic test for tamibarotene. In addition, at ASH 2020, we presented data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in 28 RARA-positive relapsed or refractory, or R/R, AML patients. Based on these data and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we are advancing tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in SELECT-MDS-1, a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients. We expect to report data from the ongoing SELECT-MDS-1 trial in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024, with a potential NDA filing expected in 2024. We are also advancing tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in SELECT-AML-1, a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, and expect to report clinical activity data from the safety lead-in portion of this trial in the second half of 2022.
 Linking Tamibarotene to Novel Patient Populations
 We leveraged our gene control platform to analyze regulatory regions of the genome in primary AML, MDS, and breast cancer patient tissue samples. We discovered that RARA was associated with a super-enhancer in some patients’ tumors but not in others. A super-enhancer is a highly specialized regulatory region of non-coding DNA central to controlling the expression of genes most crucial to the function of a given cell. The function of RARα differs depending on whether it is bound to its ligand. In the absence of a ligand, RARα represses differentiation. We believe that the RARA-associated super-enhancer drives increased expression of RARα in tumors with the super-enhancer, which leads to an abundance of unliganded RARα that results in the repression of differentiation, thereby locking the cell in an immature, proliferative and undifferentiated state. Introducing a RARα agonist, such as tamibarotene, simulates the activity of a ligand, activating differentiation.
 Tamibarotene Development Plan
 Based on the clinical activity and favorable safety and tolerability profile of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine as well as an assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need within the evolving treatment landscape, we advanced tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in SELECT-MDS-1, a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients. HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy that is closely related to AML, and as in AML, about 30% of HR-MDS patients are RARA-positive. In an earlier clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene as a single agent, clinical activity was observed in ten of 23 (43%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory AML and HR-MDS, including a marrow CR in a HR-MDS patient.
 Informed by feedback from the FDA, we are enrolling RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized study to receive tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine or placebo with azacitidine, respectively, with the CR rate as the primary endpoint.  The study will enroll approximately 190 patients randomized 2:1 into the experimental vs. control arms, respectively, and depending on the data outcome, the CR endpoint could support accelerated or full approval in this patient population in the United States. We expect to report data from the ongoing SELECT-MDS-1 trial in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024, with a potential NDA filing expected in 2024.
 In addition, we advanced tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. Our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, known as SELECT-AML-1, is designed with a single-arm safety lead-in of approximately 15 patients to confirm the dosing regimen of the triplet to be used in the randomized portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients randomized 1:1. The trial will also evaluate the triplet as 
 7
 

a salvage strategy for patients in the control arm who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine in the control arm. We expect to report clinical activity data from the safety lead-in portion of SELECT-AML-1 in the second half of 2022.
 We have entered into an agreement with a third-party commercial provider to provide a validated laboratory test under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment, or CLIA, guidelines using a diagnostic platform and approach that is being used to prospectively enroll RARA biomarker positive patients in our clinical trials. In March 2022, we entered into a Master Collaboration Agreement and associated project work plan with Qiagen Manchester Limited, or Qiagen, pursuant to which Qiagen will develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic for this biomarker.
 Tamibarotene in Combination with Azacitidine
 In October 2018, we published preclinical data in Haematologica, a peer-reviewed journal of the European Hematology Association, supporting the rationale for combining tamibarotene with hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine in AML with high RARA expression. These data showed that tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine resulted in synergistic anti-proliferative effects supported by evidence of DNA damage and apoptosis and, in patient-derived xenograft models of AML with high RARA expression, tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine showed both greater clearance of tumor cells in bone marrow and other tissues and greater duration of response, compared to either azacitidine or tamibarotene alone.
 We presented data at ASH 2020 from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy, as well as in RARA-positive R/R AML patients.
 As of October 1, 2020, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including both RARA-positive and RARA-negative patients, were eligible for a safety analysis. Eighteen RARA-positive were evaluable for clinical response. In those patients, the data showed that: 
  
• | The ORR was 67% (12/18), with a composite CR rate of 61% (11/18), including nine patients (50%) achieving CR and two patients (11%) achieving CRi.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 89% (8/9) of CRs were deep molecular or cytogenetic CRs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


o | Responses were seen across AML risk groups, including patients with mutations that are typically associated with poor outcomes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The median time to initial response was 1.2 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | The median duration of response was 10.8 months, and median OS among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 86% (6/7) of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline became transfusion independent, and 67% (12/18) of patients achieved or maintained transfusion independence.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of October 1, 2020, in the 28 RARA-negative patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the data showed that the ORR was 43% (12/28), with a composite complete response rate of 32% (9/28), including seven patients (25%) achieving CR and two patients (7%) achieving CRi. The median time to initial response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of response was 10.3 months.
 Tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single-agent azacitidine.
 We also presented translational data demonstrating that most RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients enrolled in our Phase 2 study had a monocytic disease phenotype that is associated with resistance to venetoclax. These data suggest that the RARA biomarker not only selects for patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with tamibarotene but also for patients who may be less likely to benefit from treatment with venetoclax.
 Tamibarotene as a Single Agent
 At the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting held in December 2017, or ASH 2017, we presented clinical data from cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene as a single agent in 29 patients with relapsed or refractory AML or relapsed HR-MDS, and in 29 patients with lower-risk transfusion-dependent MDS. In these cohorts of the 
 8
 

trial, we observed that chronic daily dosing of tamibarotene administered at 6 mg/m2 orally divided in two doses was generally well-tolerated, with a median treatment duration of 80 days and patients treated up to eight months and remaining on study. The majority of adverse events observed in the trial were low grade. At the time of the data cut-off for presenting data at ASH 2017, 48 patients were evaluable for response assessment, including 23 patients in the relapsed or refractory AML or relapsed higher-risk MDS cohort and 25 patients in the lower-risk transfusion-dependent MDS cohort. Myeloid differentiation was observed in the bone marrow, consistent with the underlying mechanism of action. Clinical activity and hematologic improvement were observed in ten of 23 (43%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory AML or HR-MDS, including three out of seven (43%) evaluable patients with HR-MDS, which included a marrow CR in a HR-MDS patient. We are no longer evaluating tamibarotene as a single agent in patients with AML or MDS, but we believe that these data support our decision to advance tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine into a registration enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients.
 Tamibarotene Market Opportunity
 We believe that tamibarotene has the potential to address significant unmet medical need across a range of RARA-positive cancer populations and, despite a significant number of new product approvals in AML since 2018, that there continues to be a significant unmet medical need in that indication.
 We believe that approximately 21,000 patients are diagnosed with HR-MDS in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the total addressable market opportunity for MDS patients of all risk groups to grow to approximately $3.3 billion by 2026. In addition, we believe that approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with unfit AML in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the overall total addressable market opportunity for all AML patients (fit and unfit for treatment with standard intensive chemotherapy) to grow to be approximately $6.6 billion by 2025. Based on data from 350 patients screened as of September 2019 in our Phase 2 clinical trial, we believe approximately 30% of AML and MDS patients are positive for the RARA biomarker. 
 There have been no new drug approvals for HR-MDS since 2006 other than HMAs, which represent the current standard of care but offer low CR rates with median overall survival in the range of 15 to 25 months. Based on current treatment guidelines, a majority of HR-MDS patients receive hypomethylating agents upon diagnosis, but those treatments are believed to have modest efficacy, with an estimated survival of less than 1.6 years for higher-risk, newly diagnosed patients and less than six months for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to front-line treatment.
 It is estimated that more than half of newly diagnosed AML patients are elderly or unfit for treatment with intensive therapies, underscoring the need for well-tolerated therapies that can be used in combination. Despite initial responses to therapy in select patients, the majority of AML patients relapse or become refractory to current treatment options. We believe that tamibarotene has the potential to provide a meaningful benefit for newly diagnosed unfit AML patients who are RARA-positive.
 SY-2101
 
Overview
 
In December 2020, we acquired from Orsenix a novel oral form of ATO, which we refer to as SY-2101. SY-2101 is in development for the treatment of APL, a subtype of AML defined by a fusion of the RARA and PML genes. An IV formulation of ATO is approved for use in combination with ATRA in patients with newly diagnosed lower-risk APL and, while curative in more than 80% of patients, its administration requires up to 140 two- to four-hour infusions over the typical course of induction and consolidation treatment. If SY-2101 demonstrates comparable efficacy to IV ATO in our clinical studies, we believe it has the potential to become the standard-of-care frontline therapy for APL by providing a substantially more convenient option that reduces the treatment burden on patients, improving access, and lowering costs to the healthcare system. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, SY-2101 demonstrated bioavailability PK exposures similar to IV ATO, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We anticipate reporting PK and safety data from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-2101 in the first half of 2022. Following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates suitable PK, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed lower-risk APL in the first quarter of 2023 and to announce data from that trial in 2025.
 SY-2101 Clinical Development Plan
 We have begun dosing patients in a dose confirmation study of SY-2101. The ongoing dose confirmation study is evaluating the PK, food effect, safety and tolerability of SY-2101 and is expected to enroll between six and 24 adult APL patients undergoing consolidation with IV ATO plus ATRA. Participants receive a single dose of 15 mg of SY-2101 in both 
 9
 

the fasted and in the fed state, and a single dose of IV ATO for PK assessments, with flexibility to allow for other SY-2101 doses to be evaluated.  Daily administration of SY-2101 is also being evaluated in a multiple-dose treatment module substituting for IV ATO during consolidation to assess steady state SY-2101 PK and safety. We anticipate reporting PK and safety data in mid-2022. The feedback from a Type C meeting to review our Phase 3 study design with the FDA in November 2021 continues to support molecular complete response rate as the primary endpoint for accelerated approval and event free survival as the primary endpoint for full approval, in each case compared to historic IV ATO data. In addition, FDA feedback supports the inclusion of patients randomized to IV ATO for comparative safety assessments. Based on this feedback and following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates comparable PK exposures to IV ATO, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in approximately 215 patients with newly diagnosed low-risk APL, randomized 2:1 to receive SY-2101 or IV ATO, in the first quarter of 2023, and to announce data from the Phase 3 clinical trial in 2025.
 SY-2101 Clinical Data
 To-date, SY-2101 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 PK study, which included three dose cohorts of 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, given once daily. The study enrolled 12 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, including six patients with R/R MDS, four patients with R/R AML, and two patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The median age of these patients was 76.5 years (with patients ranging from 45 to 81 years), and patients had a median of two prior therapies (with patients ranging from one to five prior therapies). The study showed that SY-2101 is bioavailable and achieves exposure levels in the range of the approved IV dose. It was generally well-tolerated at all doses, with the majority of adverse events being low-grade. Specifically, investigators reported preliminary responses in two MDS patients, observing one patient with marrow remission at two and five months after start of dosing, and another patient had bone marrow response and became eligible for transplant. Steady-state plasma concentration was reached on day 15. Exposure levels of SY-2101 at the 15 mg dose were comparable to the IV ATO approved dose (0.15 mg/kg) for adult patients, based on IV ATO historical data.   
SY-2101 Market Opportunity
 APL is a subtype of AML, defined by a genetic fusion of the RARA and PML genes, and represents about 10% of AML cases. In APL, promyelocytes are overproduced and accumulate in the bone marrow and blood, resulting in signs and symptoms of the disease.
 Approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with APL in the United States and Europe annually. We do not believe there are any oral formulations of ATO in development or on the market for the treatment of APL in the United States or Europe. 
 Contingent Obligations to Orsenix
 In December 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Orsenix, pursuant to which we acquired all of Orsenix’s assets related to SY-2101. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we paid Orsenix an upfront fee of $12.0 million. In addition, we are required to pay Orsenix single-digit million milestone payments related to the development of SY-2101 in indications other than APL, $6.0 million following the achievement of a regulatory milestone related to the development of SY-2101 in APL, and up to $10.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones with respect to SY-2101. Our obligation to pay the commercial milestone payments expires following the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of SY-2101. The Asset Purchase Agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize SY-2101 for APL in the United States during such period, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to dose the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial of SY-2101 on or before the third anniversary of the closing of the transaction; however, we retain sole discretion to operate the acquired assets as we determine.
Selective CDK Inhibition
 CDK is a family of kinases that have emerged as potentially important drug targets in cancer because of their roles in transcription, the process by which genes express proteins, and by interfering with cancer’s ability to progress unchecked through the cell cycle. We intend to build on our leadership in selective CDK inhibition for difficult-to-treat cancers by continuing to develop SY-5609, which is currently in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select advanced solid tumors. We also have selective CDK12 and CDK11 inhibitor programs in cancer, and we expect that our next development candidate will be nominated from our CDK12 program in the second half of 2022.

SY‑5609
 Overview
 SY-5609 is a highly potent and selective small molecule CDK7 inhibitor that can be administered orally. CDK7, a member of the CDK family, is a transcriptional kinase that plays a central role in two processes that cancer cells use to survive and thrive: increased expression of cancer-promoting genes, and uncontrolled cell cycle progression. CDK7 activity has been implicated in a range of solid tumors and blood cancers. We believe that inhibiting CDK7 preferentially lowers the expression of disease-driving transcription factors and anti-apoptotic proteins, resulting in the preferential killing of cancer cells over non-cancerous cells. We also believe that selective inhibition of CDK7 interferes with cancer-driving adaptations at multiple points in the cell cycle, promoting the induction of apoptosis, or cell death. Using our platform, we have generated several potent and selective small molecule CDK7 inhibitors, including SY‑5609.
SY‑5609 Clinical Development Plan
 At ESMO 2021, we presented data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in patients with breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian or pancreatic cancer, or with solid tumors of any histology having Rb pathway alterations. These data demonstrated proof of activity and proof of mechanism in refractory solid tumor patient populations, with a generally favorable tolerability profile. Based on these data, we intend to further develop SY-5609 in three tumor settings, focusing initially on indications with compelling clinical and/or preclinical activity, as well as a strong mechanistic rationale and high unmet need. We are currently evaluating SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer patients in an expansion cohort of our existing Phase 1 clinical trial. We also plan to evaluate SY-5609 as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies, before starting a focused expansion cohort. Finally, we plan to evaluate SY-5609 in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial sponsored by Roche.
Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of SY-5609 in Patients with Select Solid Tumors
 At ESMO 2021, we presented data from the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 multi-center, open-label study of SY-5609 evaluating patients with advanced breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, as well as patients with solid tumors of any histology harboring Rb pathway alterations.
 Patients were treated in cohorts exploring continuous daily dosing as well as intermittent dosing regimens, including 7d on/7d off 5d on/2d off schedules. As of a July 6, 2021 data cut-off, 54 patients treated with single-agent SY-5609 in the study were eligible for a safety analysis and 45 patients were evaluable for clinical response. The median age of patients enrolled in the study was 65.5. Patients had been heavily pre-treated with as many as eight prior therapies and a median of four prior therapies.
 Across all doses and schedules, the majority of AEs were low-grade and reversible, and there was a low rate of discontinuations due to AEs (7%). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting), fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Tolerability was optimized with the 7d on/7d off schedule, which had the lowest rates of treatment-emergent AEs relative to other regimens, while demonstrating comparable rates of SD as seen with more dose-intense regimens, supporting the selection of this schedule for further development of SY-5609. The maximum tolerated dose of the 7d on/7d off schedule has not yet been reached as of the data cut-off date, with dosing up to 6 mg. Changes in POLR2A mRNA expression, a pharmacodynamic marker for CDK7 inhibition, in patients treated with 3 mg and above were associated with anti-tumor activity and were sustained for at least three days following drug cessation, supporting intermittent dosing. The data further showed that:
  
• | Thirteen response-evaluable patients (29%) had achieved SD, with tumor regressions of up to 20% in six of those patients, across multiple tumor types.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The most substantial clinical activity was observed in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Five of 13 (39%) evaluable patients achieved SD, with tumor reductions in two of those SD patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Reductions in the CA 19-9 tumor marker, which is used in clinical practice to monitor tumor progression, were observed in three of four pancreatic cancer patients with serial CA 19-9 data, with these reductions ranging from 32% to 72%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Notably, one metastatic pancreatic cancer patient who had failed two prior lines of therapy and relapsed after a third line of treatment experienced prolonged SD of up to ten months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11
 

 
• | The analysis of clinical activity by tumor type and mutational status supported the mechanistic rationale for SY-5609 in Rb-altered and KRAS-mutant cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these data, we intend to further develop SY-5609 by exploring three combination regimens, focusing initially on pancreatic cancer, hematologic malignancies, and BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, each of which are indications with compelling clinical and/or preclinical activity, as well as a strong mechanistic rationale and high unmet need. 
 Expansion Cohort in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
 We presented preclinical data at ESMO evaluating the anti-tumor and PD activity of intermittent dosing regimens for SY-5609, as well as preclinical data evaluating SY-5609 as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer models. Taken together, these data further support Syros’ dose expansion strategy, including the decision to use a 7d on/7d off dosing schedule and combine with chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer. The data showed that SY-5609:

• | Induced robust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in ovarian cancer models that was maintained at higher doses on intermittent schedules, including a 7d on/7d off schedule. POLR2A PD effects were sustained in tumor tissue through 72 hours post-dosing, consistent with what was observed in patients in the dose-escalation study.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Induced regressions as a single agent in half (4/8) of the pancreatic cancer models that were studied, including models derived from heavily pre-treated patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resulted in deeper responses when combined on 7d on/7d off schedule with gemcitabine in KRAS-mutant pancreatic models than either agent alone.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these preclinical data, along with the data showing clinical activity in pancreatic cancer presented at ESMO 2021, we have initiated an expansion cohort that includes two arms evaluating SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The cohort is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in first or second relapse who have progressed following first-line treatment with the chemotherapy regimen known as FOLFIRINOX, with one arm exploring a doublet regimen of SY-5609 in combination with gemcitabine and the other arm exploring a triplet regimen of SY-5609 with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. SY-5609 will be administered 7d on/7d off at a starting dose of 4 mg, and the combination agents will be administered at the approved doses. The study will evaluate safety and tolerability, as well as efficacy measures such as disease control rate and progression free survival. We expect to report clinical activity data of SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy from the safety lead-in portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
 Hematologic Malignancies
 
The genetics of hematologic malignancies point to multiple oncogenic transcriptional, epigenetic, and cell cycle control drivers. The totality of preclinical data with two of our CDK7 inhibitors, SY-5609 and SY-1365 (an IV CDK7 inhibitor that we had been developing before we made the portfolio decision to discontinue its further development and prioritize the development of SY-5609) has demonstrated that blood cancers are among the most sensitive cancer cells to CDK7 inhibition. Inhibition of CDK7 has demonstrated robust preclinical data as a single agent and in combination, supporting the potential in a broad range of blood cancers. From our preclinical data, CDK7 inhibitors have shown low nanomolar potency in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, robust single agent in vivo activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and AML models, and synergy with inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or BTK, and venetoclax. 
 Based on mechanistic rationale and this preclinical data, and leveraging our expertise in hematology, we plan to initially evaluate SY-5609 as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies before starting a focused expansion cohort. The Phase 1 trial is expected to begin in the second half of 2022, with initial data expected mid-2023, which will inform further development in specific hematologic cancers. The endpoints for this study will include safety, tolerability, and clinical activity measures.
 BRAF-Mutant Colorectal Cancer
 BRAF mutations, present in 10% of colorectal cancer patients, are powerful activators of cell signaling and transcriptional programs. At the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program, or ASCO 2020, we reported the results of a series of preclinical studies of SY-5609 in colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as in 30 independent 
 12
 

patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models of colorectal cancer, including BRAF-mutant, KRAS-mutant and wild-type models. The data showed that SY-5609:
  
• | Potently inhibited proliferation and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in KRAS- and BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Induced dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, including complete regressions that were sustained after treatment discontinuation, with repeated daily dosing at well-tolerated doses that were associated with dose-dependent expression changes in cell cycle markers E2F1 and CCNB1 and the transcriptional marker POLR2A in a BRAF-mutant PDX model.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resulted in at least 50% tumor growth inhibition in 67% (20/30) of PDX models, and at least 90% tumor growth inhibition in 23% (7/30) of PDX models, including in models derived from heavily pre-treated patients, at well-tolerated doses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Deeper responses, defined as at least 90% tumor growth inhibition, were observed more frequently in models with BRAF mutations (50%, or 5/10) relative to KRAS-mutant or wild-type models (10%, or 1/10 each).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Regressions were seen in two BRAF-mutant models and one KRAS-mutant model.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that CDK7 inhibition enhances anti-tumor activity of PD1 inhibition, inducing DNA replication stress and genome instability in cancer cells and triggering immune-response signaling. In animal models, CDK7 inhibitors have been shown to enhance tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, prolonging overall survival and increasing immune cell infiltrates.
 We believe that these preclinical data support the exploration of SY-5609 in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer in combination with a PDL1 inhibitor as part of Roche’s Phase 1/1b INTRINSIC trial. We have entered into a clinical supply agreement with Roche, pursuant to which we agreed to supply SY-5609 for a combination dosing cohort with atezolizumab in Roche’s ongoing Phase 1/1b INTRINSIC trial, which is evaluating multiple targeted therapies or immunotherapy, including atezolizumab, as single agents or in rational specified combinations in molecularly defined subsets of colorectal cancer patients. SY-5609 will be evaluated in combination with atezolizumab in patients with BRAF-mutant disease, and Roche plans for this arm of the trial to be open for enrollment in the first half of 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, Roche will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1/1b study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination of SY-5609 and atezolizumab and will assume all costs associated with the study. In exchange for providing SY-5609, we will receive access to the data on SY-5609 in combination with atezolizumab. We retain all rights to SY-5609.
 SY‑5609 Market Opportunity
 With SY‑5609, we believe that we have the opportunity to address significant unmet medical needs across a range of cancers. Our clinical development program for SY‑5609 is currently focused on patients with pancreatic cancer, hematologic malignancies, and BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. 
 Pancreatic cancer is a particularly aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of cancer. This is in part because most patients do not exhibit symptoms until the cancer has reached an advanced stage. In 2022, there are predicted to be over 62,000 newly diagnosed cases in the United States and over 49,000 deaths from the disease. We believe that there are approximately 27,500 patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer in the United States. Currently, pancreatic cancer is treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and, more recently, targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The only approved second-line therapy in the United States and Europe (Onivyde® in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin) has demonstrated a progression free survival of only 3.1 months. There continues to be a need for better treatment options to improve the prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer, with a focus on new therapies that target specific genetic mutations and pathway alterations that contribute to the cancer-causing processes in cells.
 Hematological cancers account for approximately 186,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients, and over 57,000 deaths, in the United States each year. We plan to initially evaluate SY-5609 as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies, before starting a focused expansion cohort. The Phase 1 trial is expected to begin in the second half of 2022, with initial data expected mid-2023, which will inform further development in specific hematologic cancers. 
 Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and women but is the second leading cause of death in the United States. The number of colorectal cancer cases in 2021 is estimated to be 500,000 across the developed 
 13
 

pharmaceutical markets. In the United States, it is estimated that there will be 160,000 new cases, and approximately 55,000 metastatic stage patients, diagnosed this year. Chemotherapeutic regimens are the standard of care for initial treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Mutations in the BRAF gene, which are found in about 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, are associated with a poor prognosis, underscoring the need for better treatment options for these patients. Therapies targeted towards specific mutations such as BRAF are currently being investigated in clinical trials.
 Our Gene Control Platform and Discovery Programs
 There are approximately 200 different cell types in the human body. Despite having identical genomes, each of these cell types has a different function. For example, a skin cell functions differently than a muscle cell despite sharing the exact same DNA. What determines cell type and function is the specific set of genes that is expressed, or turned “on” or “off,” in that given cell. Transcription factors, transcriptional kinases, other transcriptional and regulatory proteins, and RNA play a critical role in this coordinated activation and repression of genes, and therefore, represent important points for therapeutic intervention. Because this biology is fundamental to the function of all cells, it applies across diseases.
 Although researchers have long believed that alterations in non‑coding regions of DNA, which account for 98% of the genome, play a key role in driving disease, the scientific community has lacked the tools to study these regions of the genome, rendering them poorly understood. As a result, the discovery and development of targeted therapies to date has focused almost exclusively on abnormal proteins resulting from genetic alterations found in regions of DNA that encode for proteins, which represent less than 2% of the entire genome. 
 Our Gene Control Platform
 Our proprietary gene control platform consists of two fundamental pillars: 
  
• | identifying gene control targets that, when modulated with a drug, may provide a therapeutic benefit to defined patient populations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drugging gene control targets.
--+-------------------------------

 We develop product candidates to modulate gene control targets through internal drug discovery efforts focused on creating small molecule drugs targeting transcription factors, transcriptional kinases and other transcriptional and regulatory proteins. We have also used our platform to link existing drugs to novel genomically defined patient populations, and seek to in‑license, acquire or use those drugs as starting points for our own drug discovery programs to accelerate our development path, as we did with tamibarotene.
 We have developed significant core internal capabilities in small molecule chemistry, biochemistry and structural biology to characterize the structure and function of transcription factors such as transcriptional kinases, chromatin regulators, and other transcriptional and regulatory proteins in order to generate novel chemical matter, including SY-5609, and multiple molecules across other programs in our pipeline. We have also developed a sophisticated suite of proprietary assays, which are internally developed tests to measure the biochemical, biophysical, cellular and genomic activity of known and novel compounds against gene control targets.
 Oncology Programs
 We currently have several oncology programs in our preclinical and discovery pipeline targeting the inhibition of CDK12, CDK11, and WRN.
 Our CDK12 inhibitor program builds on our capabilities to discover potent and selective small molecule inhibitors to specific members of the CDK family. In preclinical studies, we have observed that inhibiting CDK7 results in different transcriptional effects than inhibiting CDK12, pointing to distinct therapeutic opportunities to benefit patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. Specifically, we believe that a selective CDK12 inhibitor presents a therapeutic opportunity in cancers that have a dependency on DNA repair. We expect that our next development candidate will be nominated from our CDK12 program in the second half of 2022.
 CDK11 is a transcriptional kinase like CDK7 and CDK12. Utilizing our expertise in designing selective CDK inhibitors, we believe we can identify a potent and selective CDK11 inhibitor. Our work in understanding the role of CDK11 in specific tumor types and identification of synthetic lethal relationships supports the thesis that we will identify specific tumors that have a dependency on CDK11.
 14
 

WRN is a recently identified helicase of the recQ family that has been shown to be important for the survival of microsatellite instability, or MSI, colon cancer cells. We are leveraging our small molecule drug discovery capabilities to identify small molecule WRN inhibitors.  We are also using our platform to analyze regulatory regions of the genome across various cancers and monogenic diseases to identify points of therapeutic intervention in specific subsets of patients and to create a pipeline of novel product candidates targeting transcriptional and regulatory proteins. We are also using our platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte in January 2018, under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms. See “—License and Collaboration Agreements–Incyte Corporation” below.
Sickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia
 Our objective is to provide a functional cure for sickle cell disease patients by switching on the gamma-globin gene with an oral medicine. Using our gene control platform to elucidate mechanisms controlling gamma-globin gene expression, we have focused our efforts to date on LRF (leukemia/lymphoma-related factor) and the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation) complex as potential targets to switch on the gamma-globin gene, which is normally silenced a few months after birth. By turning on gamma-globin expression, we aim to induce the production of fetal hemoglobin, which is known to exert protective effects on the red blood cells of patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia and to mitigate the clinical manifestations of those diseases.
 At the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting held in December 2019, or ASH 2019, we highlighted a portion of our sickle cell disease work by reporting that we had discovered and validated a novel fetal hemoglobin repressor, Nuclear Factor I X, or NFIX, that could serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. The preclinical data presented at ASH 2019 showed that knockdown of NFIX:
  
• | increased expression of gamma-globin mRNA comparable to increases observed by decreasing the level of previously identified gamma-globin repressors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | resulted in detectable levels of fetal hemoglobin in nearly 100% of cells, compared to 16% of cells when the NFIX gene was not knocked down; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased total fetal hemoglobin levels to 40%, exceeding levels that are associated in the published literature with a functional cure in a subset of sickle cell patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration with GBT to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. See “—License and Collaboration Agreements–Global Blood Therapeutics” below.
 Intellectual Property
 We file patent applications directed to various compositions of matter, formulations and methods related to our product candidates and compounds in earlier stages of development, methods related to our gene control platform, and other commercially relevant inventions. As of December 31, 2021, we own 19 issued U.S. patents and 15 pending U.S. utility patent applications. We are pursuing or maintaining 97 corresponding patent applications that are pending or granted in various jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China, and we own five applications that are pending in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we have field-limited exclusive licenses to six issued U.S. patents and 11 corresponding applications that are pending or granted in various jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe, Japan and Canada. A significant portion of the patents and applications we own or license pertain to our product candidates that are in clinical or pre-clinical development, to methods of using them in the treatment of disease, and to methods of selecting patients for treatment based on biomarker expression.
 Our intellectual property portfolio as of December 31, 2021 is further described below. For some of our pending patent applications, prosecution has yet to commence. Prosecuting patent applications to allowance is often a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by various patent offices is often significantly narrowed, and some claims may never be granted. It is possible that we will amend the claims of our pending patent applications to limit their scope. We may also elect to abandon some of our pending patent applications, particularly those pending outside of the United States, if we determine these applications do not have strategic significance to our programs or platform.
 15
 

Tamibarotene
 The patent portfolio we own for tamibarotene contains six issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. utility patent applications, 26 applications pending or granted in countries other than the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, Russia, Israel and Mexico, and two pending PCT applications. Generally, these patents and applications disclose methods of identifying and treating patients who are sensitive to RARα agonists, including tamibarotene, based on the expression of certain biomarkers, including RARA. The applications disclose methods of treating selected patients with tamibarotene alone or with a combination of tamibarotene and a second agent, such as azacitidine. One of our issued patents, U.S. Patent No. 9,845,508, covers methods of diagnosing and treating human patients suffering from non-APL AML by administering tamibarotene; the patients are diagnosed based on the level of RARA messenger RNA, or mRNA, previously determined to be present in a sample of diseased cells from the subject. The granted claims of a second patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,167,518, cover methods of treating human subjects suffering from MDS. Selection of subjects for treatment is again based on the level of RARA mRNA expression, and RARA-positive subjects are treated with tamibarotene. A third patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,868,994, covers methods of treating non-APL AML or MDS by administering tamibarotene to a patient when a defined sample obtained from the patient is determined to have an elevated level of IRF8 mRNA or elevated levels of both IRF8 and RARA mRNA. A fourth patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,240,210, covers methods of treating non-APL AML or MDS with a combination of tamibarotene and azacitidine when a defined sample from the subject has been determined to have an elevated RARA mRNA level or an elevated IRF8 mRNA level. A fifth patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,697,025, covers methods of treating subjects who have non-APL AML with tamibarotene; treatment proceeds when a sample of diseased cells from the subject was determined to have a super enhancer associated with a RARA gene or a level of primary RNA transcripts form the RARA gene that is equal to or above a pre-determined threshold. A sixth patent, U.S. Patent No. 11,053,552, covers methods of treating non-APL AML or MDS by administering a combination of tamibarotene and a second therapeutic agent, with further specification of the analysis of an IRF8 biomarker and/or a RARA biomarker.  We believe these six U.S. patents are eligible for listing in the FDA’s “Orange Book.” These patents, as well as any additional patents that may grant from applications claiming the benefit of the same filing date as the currently granted patents, have statutory expiration dates no earlier than March 2036. Patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 In addition, we have an exclusive license from TMRC to practice the inventions claimed in two U.S. patents and five corresponding patents granted in Canada and Europe. The claims of the U.S. patents are directed to a tamibarotene capsule preparation, to a crystal form of tamibarotene, medicaments comprising that form, and methods of making it. The U.S. patent covering capsule preparations has a statutory expiration date in April 2028, and the U.S. patent related to the crystalline form has a statutory expiration date in August 2021. We do not have composition of matter patent protection with respect to tamibarotene.
SY-2101
 The patent portfolio we own for SY‑2101 contains five issued patents, three of which were obtained in the U.S., one of which was granted in Europe, and one of which was granted in Japan. In addition, applications remain pending in the U.S. and ten other jurisdictions, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China. Generally, these patents and applications disclose methods of making lyophilized compositions comprising arsenic and formulations containing the lyophilized arsenic that can be orally administered to patients having acute promyelocytic leukemia and other hematological malignancies.  One of our issued patents, U.S. Patent No. 10,111,836, covers methods of preparing an oral pharmaceutical formulation comprising a lyophilized composition comprising arsenic or lyophilized arsenic trioxide. A second patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,272,045, covers distinct methods of preparing a lyophilized composition comprising arsenic. A third patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,653,628, covers a solution for use in the lyophilization of a pharmaceutical compound comprising arsenic trioxide. These patents, as well as any additional patents that may grant from applications claiming the benefit of the same filing date as the currently granted patents, have statutory expiration dates no earlier than February 2036. Patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 SY-5609 and Other CDK7 Inhibitors
 The patent portfolio we own for SY-5609 and our other CDK7 inhibitors, including SY-1365, contains patents and patent applications generally directed to the inhibitors, pharmaceutical formulations containing them, and methods of making and using them, including their use in treating various biomarker-selected patient populations. As of December 31, 2021, we own seven issued U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, 55 corresponding applications pending or granted in countries outside the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China, and three pending applications filed in accordance with the PCT. Any patent that has issued or will issue and that claims the benefit of the priority date of one or more of these patents or patent applications will have a statutory expiration date ranging from October 2034 to October 2041. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 16
 

Of the seven issued U.S. patents we own, U.S. Patent No. 10,106,526 covers compounds and pharmaceutical compositions generically describing SY-1365; U.S. Patent No. 10,059,690 specifically claims SY-1365 and pharmaceutical compositions containing SY-1365; U.S. Patent No. 10,519,135 covers pharmaceutical compositions containing stereoisomers of SY-1365; U.S. Patent No. 10,336,760 covers CDK7 inhibitors conforming to the structural formula provided; U.S. Patent No. 10,308,648 covers CDK7 inhibitors conforming to the structural formula provided as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, hydrates, tautomers, and stereoisomers thereof; U.S. Patent No. 10,865,206 covers pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and a therapeutically effective amount of a CDK7 inhibitor conforming to the structural formula provided or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, isotopically labeled derivative, or stereoisomer thereof; and U.S. Patent No. 10,738,067 covers SY-5609 and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount thereof. The first six of these patents have statutory expiration dates in 2035, not including available patent term extensions. The seventh patent, covering SY-5609 and pharmaceutical compositions containing SY-5609, has a statutory expiration date in November 2039, not including available patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 Sickle Cell Disease
 As of December 31, 2021, we own one PCT application directed to methods of treating hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease.
 Other Programs
 The intellectual property portfolio we own that relates to programs other than those described above contains patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter for inhibiting transcription factors and immuno-oncology targets in multiple compound families, and methods of treating various diseases, including cancer and immunological diseases, through inhibition of specific transcription factor(s) or gene products. As of December 31, 2021, we own three U.S. patents and four U.S. patent applications. Our issued patents numbered 10,787,444 and 11,124,527 cover compounds conforming to the structures provided as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are intended for use as inhibitors of Myc. These patents have statutory expiration dates in June 2036. Our issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 11,040,981, covers compounds conforming to the structures provided as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that are intended for use as inhibitors of TAM kinases. This patent has a statutory expiration date in October 2038.
Platform
 Our platform technology relates to super‑enhancers, their detection, and uses thereof to identify novel disease targets. As of December 31, 2021, we have a field-limited exclusive license to three issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,155,724; 9,181,580; and 10,160,977) and one granted patent in Europe directed to these technologies. These patents have a statutory expiration date in October 2033. 
 In most countries, including the United States, a patent expires 20 years from its earliest effective filing date. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened to compensate for delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. A patent that covers a therapeutic agent may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. See “—Government Regulation and Product Approvals—Marketing Authorization” below for additional information on such exclusivity. If and when our products receive approval by the FDA or regulatory agencies in other countries, we expect to apply for a patent term extension on an issued patent covering a given product, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the terms of any of our patents.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to exclude others from making, using, or selling our product candidates and other inventions will depend on our success in obtaining valid patent claims and enforcing those claims. One or more of our pending patent applications, and any that we may file or license from third parties in the future may not, however, proceed to grant as an issued patent. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any patent may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third‑party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a 
 17
 

short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
 In addition to patents and pending patent applications, we rely upon unpatentable know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing non‑competition, non‑solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees, collaborators, scientific advisors and consultants as appropriate. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights.
 License and Collaboration Agreements
 We are a party to collaborations in which we aim to use our platform to benefit patients with diseases beyond our current areas of focus, or that we believe will contribute to our ability to advance development and ultimately commercialize our product candidates. We expect to enter into additional collaborations in the future. For instance, we intend to seek to enter into collaborations where we believe that realizing the full commercial value of our development programs will require access to broader geographic markets or the pursuit of broader patient populations or indications. Our existing collaborations impose, and any collaborations we may enter into in the future are likely to impose, certain performance obligations on us. 
 In addition, we are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. This licensed intellectual property covers some of the compounds that we are researching and developing and some of the scientific processes that we use. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future.
 Global Blood Therapeutics
 In December 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with GBT with respect to a research collaboration to discover novel targets that induce fetal hemoglobin, in order to develop new small molecule treatments for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify at least one compound for the commencement of studies that are reasonably required to meet the requirements for filing an IND. Each party will be solely responsible for its own costs incurred to conduct its activities under the research plan, except that GBT will reimburse us for full-time employee and out-of-pocket costs and expenses that we incur in accordance with the agreed upon research budget. Unless earlier terminated or extended, the research program will end in December 2022. The term of the research program may be extended by one or two one-year extensions as mutually agreed upon.
 Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we granted to GBT an option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under relevant intellectual property rights and know-how of our company arising from the collaboration to develop, manufacture and commercialize any compounds or products resulting from the collaboration. GBT may exercise this option at any time during the period (i) commencing on the earlier of (a) the date of GBT’s designation of the first IND candidate, or (b) if no IND candidate is so designated as of the expiration of the research term, the date of expiration of the research term, and (ii) ending on the 180th day after the date of expiration or earlier termination of the research term. GBT’s exercise of the option will be subject to any required filings with the applicable antitrust authority as required by the antitrust laws and satisfaction of any applicable antitrust conditions.
 After any exercise of the option, GBT will be solely responsible, at its own expense, for all development, manufacturing, regulatory activities and commercialization of licensed compounds and products worldwide. Under the collaboration agreement, GBT is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop (including to seek and obtain regulatory approval of) and, if regulatory approval is obtained, commercialize at least one product in any and all uses in the United States and any of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland. In addition, we have an option to co-promote the first product in the United States.
 GBT made an upfront payment of $20.0 million to us in January 2020. Should GBT exercise its license option, we could receive up to $315 million in option exercise, development, regulatory, commercialization and sales-based milestones per product candidate and product resulting from the collaboration. We are also entitled to receive, subject to certain reductions, tiered mid-to-high single digit royalties as percentages of calendar year net sales on any licensed product. GBT’s obligation to pay royalties, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, will commence on the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country and end on the later of (a) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim in our patent rights, 
 18
 

the jointly-owned patent rights or certain other specified patent rights that cover such licensed product in such country, and (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such country.
 Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency, and in certain other specified circumstances, subject to specified notice and cure periods. GBT may unilaterally terminate the collaboration agreement in its entirety, for any or no reason, upon nine-months’ prior written notice to us if such notice is delivered during the research term, or 90 days’ prior written notice to us if such notice is delivered after the expiration or termination of the research term. Upon the termination of the collaboration agreement in certain specified cases (including any unilateral termination by GBT), GBT has agreed to grant us, effective as of the effective date of such termination, a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under specified intellectual property necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or commercialization of licensed compounds and products for any and all uses, as well as engage in other customary technology transfer activities.
 Incyte Corporation
 In January 2018, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte. Under this agreement, we will use our gene control platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms, and Incyte has received options to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property resulting from the collaboration for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products directed to up to seven validated targets. For each option exercised by Incyte, Incyte will have the exclusive worldwide right to use the licensed intellectual property to develop and commercialize therapeutic products that modulate the target as to which the option was exercised. 
 Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Incyte paid us $10.0 million in up-front consideration, consisting of $2.5 million in cash and $7.5 million in pre-paid research funding, or the pre-paid research amount. Our activities under this agreement are subject to a joint research plan and, subject to certain exceptions, Incyte is responsible for funding our activities under the research plan, including amounts in excess of the pre-paid research amount. Under the collaboration agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research services over a period commencing on the effective date of the collaboration agreement and ending upon the completion of specified target validation activities.
 We are eligible to receive target selection milestone payments and option exercise fees of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million if Incyte selects the maximum number of targets for validation and exercises its options to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property for therapeutic products directed to all seven validated targets. Should any therapeutic product be developed by Incyte against a target as to which Incyte has exercised its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property, we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and, if approved and commercialized, royalty payments from Incyte. For each of the seven validated targets, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte a total of up to $50.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments. If products arising from the collaboration are approved, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte, for each validated target, a total of up to $65.0 million in commercial milestone payments. Upon approval and commercialization of any therapeutic product resulting from the collaboration, we would become eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on net sales of such product.
 The term of the collaboration agreement with Incyte will, unless terminated by a party early, expire when all royalty obligations for products arising from the collaboration expire. The agreement may be terminated by Incyte for convenience on sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to us, or by us on thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event Incyte or one of its affiliates or sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by us. The agreement may also be terminated by either of the parties on thirty (30) days’ prior written notice in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or immediately in the case of certain bankruptcy events. If the collaboration agreement is terminated by Incyte for material breach, then we must refund any unexpended pre-paid research amount. Incyte’s right to terminate for convenience and each party’s right to terminate for uncured material breach may be exercised either with respect to the agreement in its entirety or, as applicable, in relation to the relevant validated target and associated therapeutic products.
 In connection with the collaboration agreement, we sold 793,021 shares of our common stock to Incyte for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million in cash, or $12.61 per share, in a private placement. In addition, from the closing of this sale until the earlier of the second anniversary of such closing or the expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement, we have granted to Incyte the right to purchase up to its pro rata share of the securities offered in certain subsequent offerings of our common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. In February 2018, we sold 144,505 additional shares of our common stock to Incyte at a price of $9.55 per share, resulting in proceeds to us of $1.4 million.
 TMRC
 19
 

In September 2015 we entered into, and in April 2016 we amended and restated, a license agreement with TMRC, which we refer to as the TMRC license agreement, pursuant to which TMRC granted us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under TMRC patent rights, data, regulatory filings and other intellectual property for the North American and European development and commercialization of tamibarotene products for the treatment of human cancer indications. In January 2021, we further amended the TMRC license agreement to expand the territory under which we are licensed to include Central and South America, Australia, Israel, and Russia. Under the TMRC license agreement, we have agreed to pay TMRC single‑digit royalties based on net sales if TMRC’s patents cover our product and low single‑digit royalties based on net sales with respect to know‑how licensed by TMRC during a predefined royalty term, and to make payments to TMRC upon meeting specified clinical and regulatory milestones in an aggregate amount of approximately $13.0 million per indication, of which $1.0 million was paid in the third quarter of 2016 upon successful dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial of tamibarotene. Under the TMRC license agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to, among other things, commence development activities within one year, to develop tamibarotene in at least one cancer indication, and, following marketing approval, to market the product. The license agreement expires on the expiration of the subject patent rights or 15 years after the date of first commercial sale of product, whichever is later. The TMRC license agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party is in breach and the breach is not cured within a required amount of time or if the other party is in bankruptcy. If we have reason to do so, we may also terminate the agreement after one year from the original effective date at our sole discretion.
 In connection with the TMRC license agreement, in April 2016 we entered into a supply management agreement with TMRC. Pursuant to the supply management agreement, we and TMRC have agreed to establish a joint manufacturing committee to discuss strategy for supply of tamibarotene. In addition, we have agreed to pay TMRC a fee for each kilogram of tamibarotene we procure for clinical trial or commercial use. The supply management agreement terminates on the expiration or termination of the TMRC license agreement, and our obligation to pay these fees survives the termination of the supply management agreement. In April 2016, we also entered into a standby license with TMRC and Toko Pharmaceuticals Ind. Co. Ltd., or Toko, the owner of the patent rights licensed to TMRC from which our license agreement with TMRC derives its rights, pursuant to which we obtain a standby license from Toko if Toko’s license with TMRC is terminated.
 We have developed our own patent portfolio related to tamibarotene, which generally discloses methods of identifying and treating patients who are sensitive to RARα agonists, including tamibarotene, based on the expression of certain biomarkers, including RARA. In January 2021, we entered into a license agreement with TMRC, which we refer to as the biomarker license agreement, under which we granted TMRC an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under these patent rights and certain know-how that it controls related to the RARA biomarker for the development and commercialization of tamibarotene for human cancer indications in Japan, China, South Korea, India and Taiwan. Under the biomarker license agreement, TMRC will be obligated to pay us a low single-digit royalty on net sales of tamibarotene in these territories during a pre-specified royalty term to the extent the manufacture, use or sale of tamibarotene infringes a valid claim of the patent rights or is developed using know-how licensed to TMRC under the biomarker license agreement.Qiagen
 In March 2022, we entered into a master collaboration agreement and a project schedule with Qiagen.  Pursuant to his agreement, Qiagen has agreed to develop and commercialize an assay as a companion diagnostic test to determine the expression level of our proprietary RARA biomarker for use with tamibarotene in newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS patients.
 Under the agreement, Qiagen is responsible for developing, and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for the companion diagnostic test in the United States and, at our request and subject to the negotiation of mutually agreed payments, in the following additional markets: Canada, the United Kingdom, the member states of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Mexico, Australia, Russia, Israel and Brazil.  In addition, Qiagen has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture the companion diagnostic test and, upon negotiation of mutually agreed terms, to make the companion diagnostic test commercially available in the United States, the additional markets described above, and such other countries as the parties may mutually agree.  Qiagen has agreed to undertake specified actions to minimize the risk of an inability of supply occurring for the manufacture of the companion diagnostic test.
 Subject to the terms of the agreement and upon achievement of specified technical and development milestones, we are obligated to pay Qiagen up to a high single-digit million dollar payment in the agreement over the term of the initial project schedule in connection with developing and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the companion diagnostic in the United States. In addition, we must reimburse Qiagen for certain pass-through costs. These amounts are subject to adjustment if the parties determine that changes in the scope of the development program are required. In addition, Qiagen will retain all proceeds from the commercialization of the companion diagnostic test. We have no financial 
 20
 

obligations to Qiagen under the agreement on the commercialization of tamibarotene.
 The initial term of the agreement expires on the later to occur of (i) the fifth anniversary of the agreement and (ii) the expiration or termination of all project schedules executed under the agreement. Thereafter, the agreement automatically renews for additional periods of one year.  We may terminate the agreement or a project schedule executed under the agreement for convenience upon 90 day’s prior written notice to Qiagen. Either party may terminate the agreement or any project schedule executed under the agreement, as applicable, upon a material breach of the other party that is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach, immediately upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, or in certain other circumstances described in the agreement. In the event that we terminate the agreement for reasons other than Qiagen’s material breach or bankruptcy, we will be obligated to pay Qiagen wind-down and other costs and other final payments.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address gene control and cancer. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the fields of gene control and cancer. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, they may also be used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well‑established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third‑party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third‑party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many generic medicines currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional medicines are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines.
 21
 


If the product candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development.
 Tamibarotene
 We are developing tamibarotene, our RARα agonist, for patients with AML and MDS. We are selecting patients for our clinical trials based on high‑levels of RARα as measured by our proprietary RARA biomarker. We are aware of several new drugs approved by the FDA since 2018 for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML or patient subsets within newly diagnosed AML (including ivosidenib, venetoclax, and glasdegib), and one new drug approved by the FDA in 2020 for the treatment of MDS or patient subsets within MDS (decitabine/cedazuridine). Tamibarotene may also face competition from other agents currently in clinical development for AML and MDS, including those in late-stage development from Gilead Sciences, Inc., Abbvie Inc., Novartis AG, Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Pfizer Inc. We are not aware of any selective RARα agonist programs that are in active clinical development. 
 SY-2101
 We are developing SY-2101, a novel oral form of ATO, in patients with newly diagnosed APL. SY-2101 may face competition from Trisenox® or any of the generic forms of Trisenox, an intravenously administered arsenic trioxide product approved by the FDA for the treatment of APL. We are also aware of a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-based formulation of oral arsenic commercially available in China. In addition, we are aware of an oral formulation of arsenic trioxide in clinical development by Phebra Pty Ltd, or Phebra, an Australian based specialty pharmaceutical group. Phebra has entered into an agreement with Medsenic SAS, a European biopharmaceutical company, for the investigation of their oral arsenic trioxide compound for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. We are also aware of an oral formulation of arsenic trioxide being studied in an academic setting in Hong Kong.  
 SY‑5609
 We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in patients with select advanced solid tumors. We are aware of selective CDK7 inhibitors being developed in early clinical trials by Carrick Therapeutics Ltd. and Exelixis, Inc., and three other selective CDK7 inhibitor programs that we believe are in preclinical development from Qurient Co. Ltd., Yungjin Pharma Co., Ltd., and The Translational Genomics Research Institute, and a collaboration between Exscientia Ltd. and GT Apeiron Therapeutics Ltd. focused on developing novel CDK inhibitors, including selective CDK7 inhibitors. SY-5609 may face competition from these CDK7 inhibitors. There is also significant competition from products with mechanisms other than CDK7 inhibition in pancreatic cancer, BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, and hematological malignancies, the disease areas where we are currently focusing our development of SY-5609.
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions such as the European Union, or EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, drug products are approved and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. A company, institution or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor. The failure of a sponsor to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 22
 

Specifically, a sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA:
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Before a sponsor begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 23
 

Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides a recommendation as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access. Sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) must, however, make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients.
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. 
 24
 

There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage and dosage schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 In August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how sponsors can utilize an adaptive trial design in the early stages of oncology product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by the FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to product development and reduce developmental costs and time. Progress reports detailing the status and a brief description of available results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH.  In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues.
 25
 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Review and Approval of an NDA
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The NDA is a vehicle through which sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $3,117,218 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $369,413. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor by that time whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If not, the FDA will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs, but the review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 In connection with its review of an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs, as applicable to our business, are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. None of 
 26
 

these programs changes the standards for approval but each may help expedite the development or approval process governing product candidates.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
 27
 

The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for each indication. If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers.
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 28
 


 
• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug product.
 In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product. 
 The law now requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease.
 29
 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the product candidate. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Under Omnibus legislation signed by former President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drug products that received orphan drug designation before enactment of amendments to the FDCA in 2017 but have not yet been approved by the FDA.
 In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by the FDA.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies that must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the sponsor to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the sponsor for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the sponsor and for which the sponsor has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the sponsor. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve 
 30
 

the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. 
 Specifically, in order for an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. This interpretation of the FDCA by the FDA was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. The FDA’s regulations governing patient listings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee.  For federal fiscal year 2022, the standard fee is $374,858 and the small business fee is $93,714.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32
 

 
• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for 
 33
 

spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by former President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020, and on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
 The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid.  In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations.  These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.
 In addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.

At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Regulations and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.
Clinical Trial Approval
 On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public. 
 The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
 Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted.
 Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, a sponsor must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to a sponsor established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, sponsors must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless 
 35
 

the EMA has granted (i) a product-specific waiver, (ii) a class waiver or (iii) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may at the request of the sponsor also be used in certain other cases. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard.” The European Parliament's role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.” Such authorization is intended for products for which the sponsor can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the sponsor cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following:
  
• | the sponsor must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Regulatory Data Protection in the EU
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents sponsors for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. 

36
 


Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the sponsor must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated based on available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured, and the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU, and the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, which are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Member States may approve a specific price for a product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to 
 37
 

manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
 Approval of Companion Diagnostic Devices
 In the European Union, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or SPRs, detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745), or MDR which came into force on May 26, 2021 and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC).  Compliance with SPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices are prerequisites to be able to affix the CE Mark of Conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold.  To demonstrate compliance with the SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices.
 Separately, the regulatory authorities in the EU also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, or IVDR, (EU) 2017/746, which will become effective in May 2022.  The new regulation will replace the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC. Manufacturers wishing to apply to a notified body for a conformity assessment of their in vitro diagnostic medical device have until May 2022 to update their Technical Documentation to meet the requirements and comply with the new, more stringent Regulation.  Once applicable, the regulation will, among other things: strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market; improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
General Data Protection Regulation
 There are significant privacy and data security laws that apply in Europe and other countries. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, and it imposes heightened requirements on companies that process health and other sensitive data, such as requiring in many situations that a company obtain the consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive personal data relate before processing such data. Examples of obligations imposed by the GDPR on companies processing personal data that fall within the scope of the GDPR include providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, appointing a data protection officer, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 There are ongoing concerns about the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the EU to other countries. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, or Privacy Shield, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. While we were not self-certified under the Privacy Shield, this CJEU decision may lead to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EU to the U.S. generally and increase our costs 
 38
 

of compliance with data privacy legislation as well as our costs of negotiating appropriate privacy and security agreements with our vendors and business partners. 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. As with other issues related to Brexit, there are open questions about how personal data will be protected in the U.K. and whether personal information can transfer from the EU to the U.K. Following the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the U.K. and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR. While the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the U.K. that “implements” and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the U.K., it is unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the U.K. will remain lawful under the GDPR. The U.K. government has already determined that it considers all European Union 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the U.K. to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. In addition, a recent decision from the European Commission appears to deem the U.K. as being “essentially adequate” for purposes of data transfer from the EU to the U.K., although this decision may be re-evaluated in the future. 
 Beyond the GDPR, there are privacy and data security laws in a growing number of countries around the world. While many loosely follow the GDPR as a model, other laws contain different or conflicting provisions. These laws will impact our ability to conduct our business activities, including both our clinical trials and any eventual sale and distribution of commercial products.
 Sales and Marketing
 We hold North American, European, Central and South American, Australian, Israeli and Russian commercialization rights to tamibarotene for all cancer indications, and worldwide rights to SY-2101 and SY-5609 and all of our other preclinical programs, other than our sickle cell disease program in which we are collaborating with GBT, for all potential indications. With respect to our sickle cell disease program, GBT has the option to obtain exclusive commercialization rights to products containing compounds arising out of the collaboration for all uses. If GBT exercises its option, we have a co-promotion right in the United States with respect to the first such product.  
 Subject to receiving marketing approval, we intend to build a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States and potentially in Europe to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of physicians who are key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 Where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. Although we intend to rely on third‑party contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates and any products we may develop in the future, we have recruited personnel with experience to manage these third‑party contract manufacturers.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 124 full-time employees, including 57 employees with M.D., Ph.D. or Pharm.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 95 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 29 employees are engaged in general and administrative activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we hired 52 new employees, of whom 40 are engaged in research and development activities and 12 are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We conduct an employee engagement survey every year and, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we also conducted several additional surveys to assess employee well-being and productivity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of these surveys, we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We focus on employee recruiting and attrition rates and our progress against equity, diversity, and inclusion goals as key human capital measures in managing our business.
