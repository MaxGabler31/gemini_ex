Item 1. | Business.

The Company
Merit Medical Systems, Inc. is a leading manufacturer and marketer of proprietary disposable medical devices used in interventional, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, particularly in cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy. We strive to be the most customer-focused company in healthcare. Each day we are determined to make a difference by understanding our customers’ needs and innovating and delivering a diverse range of products that improve the lives of people and communities throughout the world. We believe that long-term value is created for our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities when we focus outward and are determined to deliver an exceptional customer experience.
Merit Medical Systems, Inc. was founded in 1987 by Fred P. Lampropoulos, Kent W. Stanger, Darla Gill and William Padilla. Initially we focused our operations on injection and insert molding of plastics and electronic and sensor-based technologies. Our first product was a specialized control syringe used to inject contrast solution into a patient's arteries for a diagnostic cardiac procedure called an angiogram. Since that time, our sales and product lines have expanded substantially, both through internal research and development projects and through strategic acquisitions. 
Our business strategy focuses on four target areas as follows:

• | enhancing growth and profitability through research and development, sales model optimization, cost discipline, and operational focus;


• | optimizing our operational capability through lean processes, cost effective environments and asset utilization;


• | targeting high-growth, high-return opportunities by understanding, innovating, and delivering in our core product groups; and


• | maintaining a highly disciplined, customer-focused enterprise guided by strong core values to globally address unmet or underserved healthcare needs.

We conduct our operations through a number of domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Our principal offices are located at 1600 West Merit Parkway, South Jordan, Utah, 84095, and our telephone number is (801) 253-1600. See Item 2. “Properties.” We maintain an Internet website at www.merit.com.
Products
     We design, develop, market, and manufacture, through our own operations and contract manufacturers, approximately 190 innovative medical products that offer a high level of quality, value and safety to our customers, as well as the patients they serve. Our products are used in the following clinical areas: diagnostic and interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general and thoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopaedic spine surgery; interventional oncology; pain management; outpatient access centers; intensive care; computed tomography; ultrasound; and interventional gastroenterology. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales generated by our top ten selling products accounted for approximately 37% of our total net sales. Sales of our inflation devices (including our Big60® device sold within our endoscopy segment and kits and packs which include inflation devices, but also include other products) accounted for approximately 11.4%, 12.7% and 14.0% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
The success of our products is enhanced by the extensive experience of our management team in the healthcare industry, our experienced direct sales force and distributors, our ability to provide custom procedural solutions such as kits, trays and 
 3

procedural packs at the request of our customers, and our dedication to offering facility-unique solutions in the markets we serve worldwide.
We offer products focused in five core product groups: peripheral intervention, cardiac intervention, interventional oncology and spine, cardiovascular and critical care, and endoscopy. A number of our products are marketed within multiple product groups; accordingly, we do not maintain separate measures of profitability by product group. Based on industry data and our internal market information, we estimate that the addressable market opportunities (in terms of annual net sales), that we are targeting with our current or newly released product portfolios, for each of our core product groups are as follows:

• | Peripheral Intervention: $2.3 billion (global)


• | Cardiac Intervention: $1.8 billion (global)


• | Cardiovascular and Critical Care: $3.4 billion (global)


• | Interventional Oncology and Spine: $1.4 billion (global)


• | Endoscopy: $496 million (U.S. domestic)

However, we operate in a competitive environment with many companies seeking to address the same market opportunities. Additionally, these opportunities may evolve significantly as a result of changes in customer preferences or the macroeconomic and regulatory environments in which we operate. For these and other reasons, we cannot guarantee the degree to which we will be able to realize increased net sales as a result of these, or any other, opportunities. 
We currently conduct our business through two financial reporting segments: cardiovascular (which includes our peripheral intervention, cardiac intervention, interventional oncology and spine and cardiovascular and critical care product groups) and endoscopy. For information relating to our business segments, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
Peripheral Intervention
We strive to provide our customers, the healthcare providers, with superior products designed to alleviate patient suffering from peripheral vascular and non-vascular diseases. These technologies support the minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment of diseases in peripheral vessels and organs throughout the body excluding the heart. Our peripheral intervention product line is organized into product portfolios as follows: Access, Angiography, Intervention and Drainage & Biopsy products.
Peripheral Access Portfolio
We offer a broad line of devices used to gain and maintain vascular access. These products include access systems such as the micropuncture family kits consisting of the MAK™ (mini access kit), the S-MAK™ (stiff MAK) and the PAK™ (pedal access kit). Additionally, our extensive line of Prelude® sheath introducers and related products provide clinicians with smooth, convenient, and less traumatic access to the patient's vasculature. The Prelude® Short Sheath provides vascular access to dialysis grafts, along with our extensive line of micro access devices as previously described. We also offer a wide range of guide wires, diagnostic catheters, therapeutic infusion systems and safety products that can be used during dialysis-related procedures.
We have continued our strategic partnership with Bluegrass Vascular Technologies, and have continued the global distribution rights with respect to the Surfacer® Inside-Out® Access Catheter System. The Surfacer system, which received CE mark approval, is an innovative Inside-Out approach to restore access to the right internal jugular vein and to preserve treatment options in hemodialysis patients with occluded veins. Additionally, we believe the Surfacer system aligns with our existing peripheral access portfolio. 
In 2017, we continued our focus on the HeRO® (Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow) Graft, a fully subcutaneous vascular access system, intended for use in maintaining long-term vascular access for chronic hemodialysis patients who have failing fistulas, grafts or are catheter dependent due to a central venous blockage. The Super HeRO® Adapter and its accompanying HeRO Ally™ Revision Kit are the newest addition to our growing HeRO family of dialysis devices. This technology offers surgeons the safety and efficiency of the original HeRO graft, but with more graft options to choose from, including early cannulation grafts, which can eliminate the need for a bridging catheter.
The CentrosFLO® Long-Term Hemodialysis Catheters anchor our chronic dialysis line. With its self-centering distal tip design, the CentrosFLO is designed to maintain long-term patency, as shown by retrospective and prospective studies published in 2016. We also offer the ProGuide® Chronic Dialysis Catheter, a “workhorse” catheter for chronic dialysis.
 4

We offer peritoneal dialysis catheters, accessories and implantation kits as part of our dialysis access product line, including the Flex-Neck® and ExxTended™ Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters. Additionally, we have expanded our peritoneal dialysis portfolio to include an implantation system for an over-the-wire catheter placement technique familiar to interventionists.
Peripheral Angiography Portfolio
The diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial disease ("PAD") is paramount to ensuring appropriate patient care and helping patients achieve an enduring productive lifestyle. We offer an extensive portfolio of diagnostic and interventional products for the diagnosis and treatment of PAD and work closely with the physicians to develop new products to aid in the treatment of this disease. 
We market a portfolio of hydrophilic and diagnostic guide wires for use in angiographic and interventional procedures in both the radiology and cardiology arena. Diagnostic guide wires are used to traverse the vascular anatomy and aid in placing catheters and other therapeutic devices to their target location. The Merit Laureate® Hydrophilic Guide Wire has a consistent, lubricious coating intended to promote advancement through the vasculature, provide support for crossing difficult lesions, and facilitate smooth catheter exchanges by minimizing friction. Our pre-coated InQwire® Diagnostic Guide Wires are lubricious and available in a wide range of configurations designed to assist physicians when navigating the peripheral vasculature and placement of devices. 
In 2017, we added the high performance InQwire® Amplatz guide wires to our product line, providing our customers with a more supportive guide wire portfolio that aids in stability within the vasculature for enhanced navigation and device delivery through the most difficult anatomy.
Catheters play an important role in the diagnosis of peripheral disease. They carry contrast media which allows the blood vessels and any anomalies to be visualized in the imaging process. Our Performa® and Impress® Diagnostic Catheter products are designed to provide solutions for traversing difficult peripheral vasculature during diagnostic procedures. These catheters work in tandem with our guide wires to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease and can be used to facilitate transradial access, a procedure which uses the wrist artery as the access entry point for peripheral procedures rather than the more traditional femoral artery approach.
Peripheral Intervention Portfolio
We market an extensive line of products designed to treat blood clots that obstruct the flow of blood in arteries and veins. Our therapeutic thrombolytic infusion systems include the Fountain® Infusion System and the Mistique® Infusion Catheter. These catheters are used to treat thrombus, or blood clots, in the peripheral vessels of the body, as well as native dialysis fistula and synthetic grafts. We offer standard and low-profile ASAP® Aspiration Catheters, which offer clinicians two options for the safe and efficient removal of fresh, soft emboli and thrombi from vessels.
For crossing tight, difficult lesions, we market our line of Merit SureCross® Support Catheters. Our SureCross catheters offer trackability, pushability and visibility utilized by physicians to cross partial and total chronic occlusions in the peripheral arteries.
Our vascular retrieval devices are single-use products designed for foreign body manipulation and retrieval and can be used to retrieve inferior vena cava filters, reposition indwelling venous catheters, strip fibrin sheath formation, and assist in recanalization of both arterial and venous chronic occlusions. We enhanced our EN Snare® Endovascular Snare System with a new robust delivery catheter and peel-away insertion tool, which simplifies the snare deployment process and increase reliability during use.
For more than two decades, we have offered inflation devices designed to accurately measure pressures during balloon and stent deployment. We offer the basixTOUCH™ Inflation Device for one-handed preparation and priming for faster preparation time. Many procedures today require high pressures. For these procedures, we offer the basixTOUCH40™ Inflation Device. Its 40 ATM (standard atmosphere) pressure capacity allows inflation of high pressure interventional balloons. Additionally, the BasixCompak™ Inflation Device and the Blue Diamond™ Digital Inflation Device feature an angled gauge for better viewing.
We expanded our Advocate™ Peripheral Angioplasty Balloon product line in 2017 with the launch of our 0.035” platform. The Advocate™ Peripheral Angioplasty Balloon products are intended for balloon dilation or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the iliac, femoral, popliteal, infra-popliteal and renal arteries. 
 5

Peripheral Drainage & Biopsy Portfolio
We have a broad line of drainage access products. Our One-Step™ Drainage Catheter, Safety Paracentesis Procedure Tray and Thoracentesis and Paracentesis Set are designed to provide clinicians with safe, convenient and cost-effective methods for removing unwanted fluid accumulation. Our Valved One-Step™ Centesis Catheters are designed with an integrated self-sealing valve to minimize the risk of air entering the pleural space and to prevent fluid leakage during thoracentesis and paracentesis procedures.
The ReSolve® Locking Drainage Catheter offers a convenient locking mechanism that we believe enhances patient comfort. A range of catheter fixation devices are also available including the StayFIX® Fixation Device and the Revolution™ Catheter Securement Device, which were designed to save time, enhance patient comfort and improve cost-effectiveness. We provide a wide selection of accessories that complement our drainage catheters, including tubing sets and drainage bags. For non-vascular applications, the mini access kit (MAK-NV™) is designed for easy visualization and quick access into the drainage area. For enhanced visibility, the kit features an echo-enhanced needle and radiopaque marker tip on the introducer.
In January 2017, we launched the CorVocet™ Biopsy System for soft tissue biopsy procedures. This exciting new product is designed to cut a full-core of tissue, providing large specimens for pathological examination. Its sleek lines, light weight, and ergonomic grip help facilitate one-handed priming, positioning, and deployment, which is especially beneficial during image-guided procedures. Additionally, the CorVocet is the first full-core biopsy needle with a customizable throw length for precision clinician control. 
In August 2017, we acquired proprietary bone and spine biopsy products from Laurane Medical S.A.S. ("Laurane"), headquartered in Sonchamp, France. We are selling these biopsy products exclusively to the existing customer base until we have transferred all of the manufacturing processes to our Irish manufacturing facility. We anticipate a full launch of the Laurane bone and spine biopsy products in the second quarter of 2018. 
Cardiac Intervention
We manufacture and sell a variety of products designed to aid in the treatment of various cardiac conditions specific to interventional cardiology and electrophysiology including cardiac rhythm management and lead management.
Two key program drivers in cardiac intervention during 2017 were the Think Radial™ Program and Think Interventional
CRT™, which stands for cardiac resynchronization therapy. Think Radial is a global education program that provides clinicians with the training and tools to commence or further their practice of the transradial approach. The transradial approach uses the artery in the wrist as the entry point for either cardiac catheterization or peripheral procedures, rather than the more traditional femoral artery in the groin. In 2017, we hosted several Think Radial training courses at our facilities for interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists from across the U.S., Europe and Canada.
The Think Interventional CRT therapy training program showcases a new interventional approach to implanting left ventricle leads. This approach utilizes new products and offers techniques to electrophysiologists who are relatively new to telescoping support catheters, subclavian vein venoplasty, and using snares to provide guidewire support. In 2017, our Think Interventional CRT training programs globally assisted with the training and education of electrophysiologists from across the U.S., Europe and Canada.
Our cardiac intervention product group is organized under product portfolios which include: Access, Angiography, Hemostasis, Intervention, and Electrophysiology.
Cardiac Access Portfolio
We offer a broad line of devices used to gain and maintain vascular access for cardiology procedures, including needles, scalpels, arm boards and sheath introducers. Our line of Prelude® Sheath Introducers is designed to provide clinicians with quick and convenient access to the patient's vasculature. The PreludeEASE™ Hydrophilic Sheath Introducer is our anchor product for radial access, designed to provide access to the radial artery while minimizing the potential for spasm with a hydrophilic coating that extends to the tip of the sheath.
To provide a more complete offering for radial access procedures, we offer the Rad Board® family of products. The Rad Board is designed to provide radiation protection to physicians, provide a larger work space for physicians and an area for patients to rest their arms during radial procedures.

Cardiac Angiography Portfolio
For angiography procedures, we market an array of diagnostic catheters including the Performa® line. We believe that these catheters offer physicians superior torque, high shaft strength for pushability and a large inner diameter for improved flow rates during a variety of angiographic procedures. Our MIV™ Radial Ventriculogram Pigtail Catheter addresses the difficulty in accessing the left ventricle from the radial artery, which occurs when using standard femoral approach catheters.
Cardiac Hemostasis Portfolio
Catheterization for diagnostic and interventional cardiology procedures generally takes one of two approaches, femoral or radial. We offer products to assist clinicians in obtaining and maintaining hemostasis following arterial catheterization by either approach. For hemostasis of the femoral artery, we offer the Safeguard® Pressure Assisted Device and for hemostasis of the radial artery, we now offer the PreludeSYNCTM hemostasis device, as well as our legacy Safeguard RadialTM device. These devices compete in a fast-growing segment within the interventional cardiology and radial compression markets. The PreludeSYNC was designed to address the market need for improved patient comfort and clinician use without compromising safety. To accomplish this, the device has a soft band with a secure hook and loop closure. To improve patient experience, the device comes packaged with creative, unique designs printed directly on the band, which is a first of its kind for our company. Additionally, we have recently provided the option to customize the bands for healthcare facilities. This can be with their logo or specific messaging, providing a personalized experience.
We have developed a broad line of clinically acclaimed hemostasis valves, MAP™ Merit Angioplasty Packs and angioplasty accessories. Hemostasis valves connect to catheters and allow passage of additional guide wires, balloon catheters and other devices into the vasculature, while reducing the amount of blood loss during the procedures. Our hemostasis valve line includes the Honor®, PhD™, AccessPLUS™, Access-9™, DoublePlay™, MBA™ and the Passage®.
Cardiac Intervention Portfolio
For more than two decades, we have offered an extensive line of inflation devices designed to accurately measure pressures during balloon and stent deployment. The basixTOUCH™ Inflation Syringe reduces preparation time through its single-handed preparation and priming features. The Blue Diamond™ Digital Inflation Device features an angled gauge for better viewing. Additionally, our IntelliSystem® and Monarch® Inflation Devices, as well as the BasixCOMPAK™ Inflation Syringe, offer clinicians a wide range of features and prices.
During coronary catheterization procedures, guiding catheters are used to gain access to the heart. Our line of Concierge® Guiding Catheters has an advanced braiding technology and proprietary polymer-blend shaft, which allow for an increased lumen size while maintaining exceptional support.
Pericardiocentesis is a procedure through which fluid is aspirated from the pericardial sac (the sac enveloping the heart). Our pericardiocentesis kit is designed as an organized, ready-to-use, convenient tray to assist the clinician in draining fluid quickly from the pericardial sac.
For angiography and angioplasty procedures we offer the Ostial PRO® Stent Positioning System, a medical-grade disposable guide wire system designed to provide consistent and precise stent implantation in aorto-ostial lesions during coronary or peripheral interventional procedures. Additional angiographic accessories include the Flow Control Switch™, an integrated, one-handed, single-channel switch designed with clinician and patient safety in mind.
Electrophysiology Portfolio
We offer innovative solutions to address lead implantation and therapeutic delivery in the rapidly-expanding cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology markets.
Cardiac rhythm management (“CRM”) is the field of cardiac disease therapy that relates to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias or the improper beating of the heart with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Our CRM products include the Classic Sheath™, Prelude SNAP™, and Prelude SNAP™ Hydrophilic families of splittable hemostatic sheaths designed for the insertion of cardiac leads for pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. We also offer the Worley™ Advanced LV Delivery System to aid in the insertion and implantation of left ventricular pacing leads, through the coronary sinus to the left lateral wall of the heart for heart failure patients. The Worley™ Advanced LV Delivery System has been shown to reduce lead implant failures, improve target lead location and reduce procedure times.

Electrophysiology is the study of diagnosing and treating abnormal electrical activities of the heart. Common electrophysiology procedures include diagnostic electrophysiology studies and therapeutic ablation procedures designed to treat arrhythmias. We offer the HeartSpan® Transseptal Needle, which is designed with a larger ergonomic handle, unique unibody needle design and optimal needle sharpness; the HeartSpan® Transseptal Sheath, which features an improved hemostasis valve for reduced blood loss and air embolism, smooth sheath to dilator transition for easier transseptal crossing, and reinforced stainless steel tubing for excellent torque response. In 2017 we updated this product line with new lengths and shapes to match market demands. Additionally, we launched a second generation HeartSpan® Steerable Sheath Introducer responding to user feedback with a variety of key features, most notably a neutral position indicator to help physicians with orientation. 
Cardiovascular and Critical Care 
Every year thousands of critical care patients experience Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections ("CRBSI"). CRBSI is one of the most frequent, costly, and mortal complications of central venous catheterization. In February 2017, we acquired the assets of Catheter Connections, Inc. to enhance our existing clinical safety product portfolio by providing a novel disinfectant cap, the DualCap® Disinfection and Protection System to minimize the potential of catheter associated infections. To complement the acquisition of Catheter Connections, we also acquired critical care assets from Argon Medical Devices, Inc. ("Argon") to create a broad business line of products and solutions for cardiac and critical care patients. Combined with a robust pipeline of product development projects, we believe the cardiovascular and critical care business is positioned to provide innovative solutions to meet the needs of critical care patients and clinicians for years to come. 
Infection Prevention & Safety 
Medical errors are cited as the third leading cause of death in the USA, with approximately 250,000 preventable deaths occurring annually. Color-coded Medallion® Syringes along with the Pen and Label (PAL™) Medication Labeling System comply with patient safety initiatives from the Joint Commission to reduce medication delivery errors. Contaminated fluids and needle stick injuries may spread infectious diseases to clinical workers and providers. Our ShortStop® Temporary Sharps Holders protect clinicians from accidental needlesticks while our family of BackStop® Disposable Basins meet the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines for contaminated fluids and waste. 
The recent acquisition of the DualCap augments our foundation of safety products to further prevent contamination and infection of invasive vascular lines. Unlike other cleaning alternatives in the marketplace, the DualCap prevents alcohol from entering the blood stream of male luer connections while reducing the time required to disinfect needleless connectors. 
Hemodynamic Monitoring 
Blood pressure monitoring assists in determining proper patient treatment. We have an extensive portfolio of fluid management and monitoring devices, including the Meritrans® Disposable Pressure Transducer and the TRAM® Manifolds with Integral Transducers. The acquisition of certain critical care products from Argon expanded our patient monitoring portfolio by providing the Safedraw® Closed Arterial Blood Sampling Kits, thermodilution catheters, and DTXPlus® Disposable Pressure Transducers. The acquisition further bolstered our kits, packs, and procedure tray business by adding the Careflow® Central Venous Catheters, Arterial Catheters, and Introducer Sheaths.
Interventional Oncology and Spine
In June 2017, we received 513(f)(2) (de novo) classification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") to expand indication for our Embosphere® Microspheres. The indication now includes prostatic artery embolization (“PAE”) for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. Embosphere is the first embolic agent to receive FDA clearance for prostatic artery embolization, providing a non-surgical treatment option for millions of men who suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlarged prostatic gland and can cause lower urinary tract symptoms in men. The PAE procedure is performed through an incision in the patient’s upper thigh or wrist, and may use Embosphere Microspheres to occlude the prostatic arteries, reducing their blood supply and causing the prostate to shrink and improve symptoms.
In July 2017, we acquired the assets of Osseon LLC ("Osseon"). The Osseon product line, Osseoflex®, compliments and rounds out our portfolio for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures ("VCF"). The Osseoflex products include access kits, steerable needles, steerable and straight balloons, bone cement, as well as cement mixing and delivery systems. Osseon’s steerable products fit well with our unique brand of directional devices that allow users to navigate and target specific spine anatomy.

Vertebral Compression Fractures Portfolio
VCFs occur when a vertebra cracks, fractures or collapses due to osteoporosis or cancer. VCFs can be extremely painful and have debilitating effects on a patient’s quality of life. Using our StabiliT® System, physicians treat VCFs by inserting small instruments through the skin into the fractured vertebra. Bone cement is injected through a hollow needle into the fractured bone. Our StabiliT® System is a comprehensive treatment system and includes access instruments, osteotomes, introducers, bone cement and corresponding mixing and delivery systems.
Ablation Portfolio
We offer our STAR™ Tumor Ablation System to cancer patients for the palliative treatment of painful metastatic tumors. Targeted radiofrequency ablation using the STAR System offers patients pain relief and improved quality of life in a minimally invasive treatment. This procedure requires an articulating radiofrequency, or RF, device to be placed through the skin into the vertebral body and inserted directly into the tumor to ablate the tumor. Thermocouples embedded in the RF device allow for constant monitoring of the temperature directly in the ablation zone, which is a key feature when performing ablations near vital structures like the spinal cord. The STAR system includes ablation instruments, introducers, osteotomes and our MetaSTAR® RF Generator.
Inflation Syringes
Our digital inflation devices, the IntelliSystem®, Monarch and Blue Diamond™ are used in discography, a technique used to determine whether a disc is the source of pain in patients with back or neck pain.
Oncology Portfolio
In the United States, we sell QuadraSphere® Microspheres for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors, including hepatoma, and arteriovenous malformations. Malignant hepatoma, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma, is a common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. QuadraSphere Microspheres are precisely calibrated and designed to offer controlled, targeted embolization, treating hepatocellular carcinoma by reducing or stopping the blood flow to the tumors.

In Europe, as well as Brazil, Russia, and in many other markets, excluding the U.S., we offer HepaSphere™ Microspheres for delivery of chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer.
Embolotherapy Portfolio
We offer Embosphere® Microspheres to treat hypervascularized tumors, including symptomatic uterine fibroids, embolization of the prostatic arteries for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, and arteriovenous malformations in the United States as well as Europe and other international markets. Additionally, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we offer Embosphere Microspheres for hemostatic embolization.
We also offer polyvinyl alcohol particles, Bearing nsPVA®, globally for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors, including symptomatic uterine fibroids and vascular malformations.
Delivery Systems Portfolio
We manufacture a variety of microcatheters for the controlled and selective infusion of diagnostic, embolic, or therapeutic agents into vessels. The SwiftNINJA® steerable microcatheter articulates up to 180 degrees in opposing directions. This articulating feature allows physicians to treat diseases that in the past would have been too difficult to access due to challenging patient anatomies. We continue to offer our Merit Maestro® Microcatheter, which has a swan neck design that allows physicians to "seat" the catheter in the vessel. The SwiftNINJA and Maestro can be used for the controlled and selective infusion of diagnostic, embolic, or therapeutic materials into vessels. They are compatible with many key configurations of Embosphere, Quadrasphere, HepaSphere, Bearing nsPVA, and other competitive embolic products.
In 2017, we introduced the True Form™ Reshapable Guide Wire which was designed with the ability to be shaped and reshaped multiple times for vessel cannulation. True Form’s stainless steel core provides excellent support, its hydrophilic coating increases trackability through vessels, the flexible shaft easily navigates tortuous anatomy, and its shapeable tip retains shape during procedures. In August 2017, we began offering the Merit Maestro® Microcatheter and True Form Reshapable Guide Wire packaged together to make it more convenient for customers to order their microcatheters and guide wires.

Marketing and Sales
Target Market/Industry. Our principal target markets are peripheral intervention, cardiac intervention, interventional oncology, critical care and endoscopy. Within these markets our products are used in the following clinical areas: diagnostic and interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general and thoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopaedic spine surgery; interventional oncology; pain management; outpatient access centers; intensive care; computed tomography; ultrasound; and interventional gastroenterology. 
According to U.S. government statistics, cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading cause of death and a significant health problem in the United States. Treatment options range from dietary changes to surgery, depending on the nature of the specific disease or disorder. Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty, stenting and endoluminal stent grafts, continue to represent important therapeutic options for the treatment of vascular disease. We derive a large percentage of our revenues from sales of products used during percutaneous diagnostic and interventional procedures such as angiography, angioplasty and stent placement, and we intend to pursue additional sales growth by building on our existing market position in both catheter technology and accessory products. 
In addition to products used in the treatment of coronary and peripheral vascular disease and in electrophysiology, we continue our efforts to develop and distribute other devices used in our target markets. For example, we have developed and are distributing products used for percutaneous drainage. Prior to the widespread use of computed tomography or ultrasound imaging, surgery was necessary to drain internal fluid from body cavities and organs. Currently, percutaneous drainage is frequently prescribed as the treatment of choice for many types of fluid collections. Our family of drainage catheters and associated devices are used by physicians in interventional radiology, vascular surgery and cardiology catheter lab procedures.
Marketing Strategy. As part of our product sales and marketing efforts, we attend major medical conventions throughout the world pertaining to our target markets and invest in market development including physician training, peer-to-peer education, and patient outreach. We work closely with major healthcare facilities and key opinion leader physicians involving our primary target markets in the areas of training, therapy awareness programs, clinical studies and ongoing research.
We also offer products to service the dialysis access market. These products are used in renal replacement therapies, including the treatment of acute renal failure, chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease. Our hemodialysis access products include catheters and kits for interventional radiologists and interventional nephrologists. Our family of peritoneal dialysis products is designed to support specific implantation techniques for interventional radiologists, interventional nephrologists and laparoscopic surgeons. We also offer a variety of products for dialysis access interventions for these customers.
We believe the development of Merit Endotek and the move into the areas of interventional gastroenterology, pulmonology and thoracic surgery will open new opportunities to sell our existing products, such as inflation devices, syringes, centesis catheters and procedure kits to those markets, but will also provide opportunities to market additional products incorporating our non-vascular stent, balloon dilator and guide wire technologies.
In general, our target markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. We plan to continue to develop and launch innovative products to support clinical trends and to address the increasing demands of these markets.
Product Development Strategy. Our product development is focused on identifying and introducing a regular flow of profitable products that meet customer needs. To stay abreast of customer needs, we frequently seek suggestions from health care professionals working in the fields of medicine in which we offer or are developing products. Suggestions for new products and product improvements may also come from engineers, marketing, sales people, physicians and technicians who perform clinical procedures.
When we believe that a product suggestion demonstrates a sustainable competitive advantage, meets customer needs, fits strategically and technologically with our business and has a good potential financial return, we generally assemble a “project team” comprised of individuals from our sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, legal, and quality assurance departments. This team works to identify the customer requirements, integrate the design, compile necessary documentation and testing, and prepare the product for market introduction. We believe that one of our marketing strengths is our capacity to conceive, design, develop and introduce new products.
U.S. and International Sales. Sales of our products in the U.S. accounted for approximately 58%, 61% and 61% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the U.S., we have a dedicated, direct sales 
 11

organization primarily focused on selling to end-user physicians, hospitals and clinics, major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. 
Internationally, we employ sales representatives and contract with independent dealer organizations and custom procedure tray manufacturers to distribute our products worldwide, including territories in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, South and Central America, Oceania, and Canada. In 2017, our international sales grew approximately 32% over our 2016 international sales, and accounted for approximately 42% of our net sales. China represents our most significant international sales market with net sales of approximately $73.4 million, $59.9 million, and $50.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the recent and planned additions to our product lines, we believe our international sales will continue to increase. 
Our largest non-U.S. market is China, which represented approximately 10% of our net sales in 2017. We maintain a distribution center and administrative office in Beijing. We also have small sales offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. We sell our products through more than 400 distributors in mainland China, who are responsible for reselling the products, primarily to hospitals. We employ sales personnel throughout China who work with our distributors to promote the clinical advantages of our products to clinicians and other decision makers at hospitals. Under this “modified direct” sales approach, our salespeople are involved with promoting the advantages of our products to clinicians and other customers, while the distributors handle sales transactions and address issues related to fulfillment and inventory management.
In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we have both corporate (i.e., direct) and modified corporate sales operations. Our corporate sales operations are active throughout Europe, including the largest markets of the UK, France, Germany, and Sweden. 
Our direct sales personnel are principally engaged in each of our product groups. Marketing teams responsible for each product group operate clinical education programs, often directed by leading subject matter personnel, who provide technical instruction on techniques and therapies to physicians, nurses, and technologists. We are currently conducting education programs specific to radial access, spinal intervention, surgical grafts, and electrophysiology. 
We require our international dealers to store products and sell directly to customers within defined sales territories. Each of our products must be approved for sale under the laws of the country in which it is sold. International dealers are responsible for compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as all applicable laws and regulations in their respective countries. 
In 2016, we began conversions from distributor-based sales models to direct sales models in Australia and Canada. We now supply hundreds of healthcare providers directly in Australia and Canada from Merit-operated distribution centers in those countries. In May 2017, we terminated our distribution agreement with Sheen Man Co., Ltd. and Sugan Co, Ltd., (collectively "Sugan"), a Japanese medical device distributor, and acquired the customer list Sugan used in the distribution of many of our products in Japan. In connection with our acquisition of the critical care division of Argon, we have implemented a modified direct sales approach (similar to the approach we are pursuing in China) to market and sell the majority of our products in Japan. Our goal with conversion is to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within these sales channels.
We consider training to be a critical factor in the success of our sales force. Members of our sales force are trained by our clinical marketers, our staff professionals, consulting physicians, and senior field trainers in their respective territories.
OEM Sales. Our global OEM division sells components and finished devices, including molded components, sub-assembled goods, custom kits and bulk non-sterile goods, to medical device manufacturers. These products may be combined with other components and products from other companies and sold under a Merit or third-party label. Products sold by our OEM division can be customized and enhanced to customer specifications, including packaging, labeling and a variety of physical modifications. Our OEM division serves customers with a staff of regional sales representatives based in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and a dedicated OEM Engineering and Customer Service Group.
Customers
We provide products to hospitals and clinic-based physicians, technicians and nurses. Hospitals and acute care facilities in the United States generally purchase our products through our direct sales force, distributors, OEM partners, or custom procedure tray manufacturers who assemble and combine our products in custom kits and packs. Outside the United States, hospitals and acute care facilities generally purchase our products through our direct sales force, or, in the absence of a sales force, through independent distributors or OEM partners.
 12

In 2017, our U.S. sales force made sales accounting for approximately 42% of our net sales directly to U.S. hospitals and sales accounting for approximately six percent of our net sales through other channels, such as U.S. custom procedure tray manufacturers and distributors. We also sell products to other medical device companies through our U.S. OEM sales force, which accounted for approximately 10% of our 2017 net sales. The remaining 42% of our 2017 net sales was attributable to sales made to international markets by our direct sales force, international distributors, and our OEM sales force. Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Research and Development
Our research and development operations have been central to our historical growth, and we believe they will be critical to our continued growth. In 2017, our commitment to innovation led to the introduction of several new products, improvements to our existing products and expansion of our product lines, as well as enhancements and new equipment in our research and development facilities.
Our research and development expenses were approximately $51.4 million, $45.2 million, and $40.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
We continue to develop new products and make improvements to our existing products utilizing many different sources. Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Research & Development, work closely with our sales and marketing teams to incorporate feedback from physicians and clinicians in the field, which can lead to innovative new products and improvements to our existing products.
Currently we have research and development facilities in:

• | Dallas, Texas


• | Galway, Ireland


• | Jackson Township, New Jersey


• | Malvern, Pennsylvania


• | Paris, France


• | Pearland, Texas


• | San Jose, California


• | Singapore


• | South Jordan, Utah


• | Tijuana, Mexico


• | Venlo, The Netherlands


• | West Jordan, Utah

Manufacturing
We manufacture many of our products utilizing our proprietary technology and our expertise in plastic injection and insert molding. We generally contract with third parties for the tooling of our molds, but we design and own most of our molds. We utilize our experience in injection and insert molding technologies in the manufacture of most of the custom components used in our products. We have received International Standards Organization (“ISO”) 13485:2003 certification for our facilities in Utah, Texas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, The Netherlands, Ireland, France, Singapore and Mexico. We have also received ISO 9001:2008 certification for our coatings facility in Venlo, The Netherlands and our Merit Sensor Systems, Inc. (“Merit Sensors”) facility in South Jordan, Utah. Merit Sensors develops and markets silicon pressure sensors and presently supplies a substantial portion of the sensors we utilize in our digital inflation devices and blood pressure sensors.
Given the specialization of our manufacturing personnel and processes in our Utah and Ireland facilities, we possess the capability to strategically shift the manufacture of more technologically advanced products to those facilities, and utilize the manufacturing capacity of our other facilities for more commoditized products. The actual determination of manufacturing location will be based upon multiple factors, including technological capabilities, market demand, acquisition and integration activities and economic and competitive conditions. 
We currently produce and package all of our embolic products. Manufacturing of our embolic products includes the synthesis and processing of raw materials and third-party manufactured compounds.
 13

We have packaging and manufacturing facilities located in Chester, Virginia; Galway, Ireland; Joinville, Brazil; Malvern, Pennsylvania; Melbourne, Australia; Paris, France; Pearland, Texas; Singapore; South Jordan and West Jordan, Utah; Tijuana, Mexico; and Venlo, The Netherlands. See Item 2. “Properties.”
We have distribution centers located in Auckland, New Zealand; Bangalore, India; Beijing and Hong Kong, China; Chester, Virginia; Joinville, Brazil; Maastricht, The Netherlands; Malvern, Pennsylvania; Melbourne, Australia; Toronto, Canada; Podolsk, Russia; Seoul, South Korea; South Jordan, Utah; Tijuana, Mexico; and Tokyo, Japan. 
We believe that our variety of suppliers for raw materials and components necessary for the manufacture of our products, as well as our long-term relationships with such suppliers, promote stability in our manufacturing processes. Historically, we have not been materially affected by interruptions with such suppliers; however, we are experiencing a growing trend from suppliers of polymer resins to refuse to supply resin to medical device manufacturers or require that we assume additional risks due to the potential for product liability claims. There can be no assurance that we will not experience supply disruptions in the future. We seek to develop and have relationships with potential back-up suppliers for materials and components in the event of supply interruptions.
Competition
The medical products industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are much larger than us and have access to greater resources. We also compete with smaller companies that sell single or limited numbers of products in specific product lines or geographies. We compete globally in several market areas, including diagnostic and interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general and thoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopaedic spine surgery; interventional oncology; pain management; outpatient access centers; intensive care; computed tomography; ultrasound; and interventional gastroenterology.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which our products are sold are quality, price, value, device features, customer service, breadth of line, and customer relationships. We believe our products have achieved market acceptance primarily due to the quality of materials and workmanship of our products, clinical outcomes, their innovative design, our willingness to customize our products to fit customer needs, and our prompt attention to customer requests. Our products are priced competitively, but generally not below prices for competing products. Some of our primary competitive strengths are our relative stability in the marketplace; a comprehensive, broad line of ancillary products; and our history of introducing a variety of new products and product line extensions to the market on a regular basis.
In the interventional cardiology and the radiology markets as well as the gastroenterology, endoscopy, general surgery, thoracic surgery and pulmonology markets, we compete with large international, multi-divisional medical supply companies such as Cordis Corporation (Cardinal Health); Boston Scientific Corporation; Medtronic; Abbott; Teleflex; Becton, Dickinson and Company (including the operations previously conducted by C.R. Bard) ("BD"); Cook Incorporated; Stryker Corporation ("Stryker"); 3M; ICU Medical and Terumo Corporation. Medium-size companies we compete with include B. Braun; Uresil; BTG; Olympus Medical; Edwards Lifesciences; Argon; CONMED; AngioDynamics; Medcomp and U.S. Endoscopy.
Based on available industry data, with respect to the number of procedures performed, we believe we are a leading provider of digital inflation technology in the world. In addition, we believe we are one of the market leaders in the United States for analog inflation devices. We believe we are a market leader in the United States for control syringes, waste-disposal systems, tubing and manifolds. We anticipate the recent and planned additions to our product lines will help us compete even more effectively in both the U.S. and international markets. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing competitive advantages or compete successfully in the future.
We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from sales of products used in diagnostic angiography, interventional cardiology and radiology procedures. We believe medical professionals are starting to use new interventional methods, procedures and devices, as well as drugs, for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. These new methods, procedures, devices and drugs may render some of our products obsolete or limit the markets for our products. However, with the advent of vascular stents and other procedures, we have experienced continued growth in sales of our products.
In the vertebral augmentation market, our main competitors are Medtronic and Stryker. Both Medtronic and Stryker offer products to treat vertebral compression fractures (including the CareFusion products Stryker acquired from BD, but only Medtronic offers products to treat metastatic spine tumors.
Within the field of uterine fibroid embolization ("UFE") and PAE, we believe we are a market share leader. Based on both research and clinical studies conducted on our product for UFE and PAE, we believe we offer physicians consistent and 
 14

predictable product performance, ease of use, targeted delivery, and durable vessel occlusion, and therefore satisfactory short- and long-term clinical outcomes validated by peer-reviewed publications, when compared to our competitors.
Our primary embolotherapy product has been Embosphere Microspheres. Currently, the primary products with which our microspheres and embolic particles compete are Beadblock® and DC Bead®, sold by BTG plc; Embozene™ and Contour® sold by Boston Scientific, Inc; PVA Foam Embolization Particles, sold by Cook Medical; HydroPearl®, sold by Terumo International Systems ("Terumo"); and Gelfoam®, sold by Pfizer Inc. Our principal competitors in UFE are BTG plc, Boston Scientific and Terumo, as well as companies selling or developing non-embolotherapy solutions to treat uterine fibroids.

Proprietary Rights and Litigation
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have a number of U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and, for the U.S., is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent. As of December 31, 2017, we owned or had a license to more than 1,000 U.S. and international patents and patent applications. Additionally, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets are critical to our business, but no single patent, trademark or other intellectual property asset is of material importance to our business.
The Merit® name and logo are trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to the Merit name and logo, we have used, registered or applied for registration of other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products, technologies and services from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign countries. See “Products” above. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country; in the U.S. we generally can maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use. As of December 31, 2017, we owned over 300 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications. 
There is substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant, as well as a counter-claimant or counter-defendant, in patent, trademark, and other intellectual property infringement actions. If a court rules against us in any intellectual property litigation we could be subject to significant liabilities, be forced to seek licenses from third parties, or be prevented from marketing certain products. In addition, intellectual property litigation is costly and may consume significant time of employees and management.
Regulation
U.S. Regulation. The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other federal, state and local authorities regulate our products and product-related activities. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and accompanying regulations, the FDA regulates the design, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and promotion of medical devices. We believe our products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable FDA regulations, but the regulations are subject to change. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes may have on our business. In addition, if we experience regulatory problems with a product or manufacturer, we could become subject to fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In October 2016, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice seeking information on certain of our marketing and promotional practices. We are in the process of responding to the subpoena, which we anticipate will continue during 2018. The investigation is ongoing and at this time we are unable to predict its scope, duration or outcome. Investigations such as this may result in the imposition of, among other things, significant damages, injunctions, fines or civil or criminal claims or penalties against our company or individuals. 
Overview of the FDA Regulation of Devices. The FDCA establishes a risk-based classification system for medical devices and applies regulatory controls commensurate with the risk posed by a device:

• | Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (QSRs), facility registration and product listing, reporting of certain adverse medical events and malfunctions, and compliance with the FDA’s restrictions against misbranding and adulteration. While most Class I devices are exempt

 15

from the 510(k) premarket notification process (assuming they are within the limitations of the exemption), some Class I devices also require 510(k) clearance by the FDA.

• | Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, including the design control requirements of the QSRs, and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. While most Class II devices require premarket review and clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification process (assuming they are within the limitations of the exemption).


• | Class III devices are those deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or those devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. Class III devices include those devices for which the FDA has determined that general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device.

FDA Premarket Review. In general, we cannot introduce a new medical device into the market until we obtain market clearance through a 510(k) premarket notification or approval through a premarket approval (“PMA”) application. Some devices, typically lower-risk devices, are subject to specific exemptions from premarket review. In addition, in limited cases, devices may come to the market through alternative procedures, such as a de novo classification request or humanitarian device exemption.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a device manufacturer must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process; a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976; a device that has been down-classified by the FDA to Class I or Class II; or a device that the FDA has previously determined to be exempt from the 510(k) process. To be substantially equivalent, the notification must show that the new device has the same intended use and the same technology as the predicate device, or, if the new device has different technology, that the device is as safe and effective as the predicate device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. Performance testing is generally required to demonstrate substantial equivalence, and, for some devices, clinical data may be required. The standards and data requirements necessary for the clearance of a new device may be unclear or may be subject to change. In addition, the FDA may publish or adopt special controls it deems necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device, which might include standards for the testing and clearance of a new device. The 510(k) clearance procedure usually takes between three months and one year from the date a 510(k) notification is submitted, but it may take longer. The FDA may find that substantial equivalence has not been shown and, as a result, require additional clinical or non-clinical testing to support a 510(k) or require the submission of a de novo classification request or PMA application for the device.
A de novo classification is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices that are low to moderate risk but for which no substantially equivalent predicate device exists. Clearance of a de novo request generally takes six months to one year from the time of submission of the de novo request, although it can take longer.
A PMA application is required for Class III devices. The application must demonstrate that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use based on valid scientific evidence. The PMA application process can be expensive, generally takes several years to complete and typically includes, among other things, human clinical trials, manufacturing facility inspection, bench tests and laboratory and animal studies, which can be costly to conduct. There is also a substantial “user fee” that must be paid to the FDA in connection with the submission of each PMA application. The FDA may determine that additional information, including clinical data, be submitted before a determination is made, which could significantly delay the introduction of new devices. If the FDA approves the PMA application, it may place restrictions on the device. If the FDA's evaluation of the PMA application is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require additional testing or clinical trials prior to approval or as a condition of approval.
If human clinical trials of a medical device are required for FDA clearance or approval and the device presents a significant risk, the sponsor of the trial must file an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application with the FDA prior to commencing human clinical trials in the USA. Submission of an IDE application does not ensure that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. For clinical trials involving a device that does not present a significant risk, the sponsor is not required to obtain approval of an IDE, but the sponsor must obtain the review and approval of an institutional review board. Both significant risk and non-significant risk trials are subject to additional FDA regulations, including a requirement to obtain informed consent and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the institutional review 
 16

board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
The FDA clearance and approval processes for medical devices are expensive, uncertain and lengthy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for any product on a timely basis or at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if the FDA discovers that an applicant has submitted false or misleading information, the FDA may refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to its Application Integrity Policy, which specifies procedures that the FDA personnel should follow to ensure the integrity of data and information in applications submitted for FDA review and approval. 
We are currently conducting a clinical trial to obtain PMA approval from the FDA to claim the use of the QuadraSphere Microspheres with doxorubicin for the treatment of liver cancer in the United States. In order for us to obtain FDA approval to promote the use of QuadraSphere Microspheres for the purposes indicated in our clinical trial, we will need to complete the trial and submit positive clinical data to the FDA. If we cannot enroll study subjects in sufficient numbers to complete the necessary studies, if there is a disruption in the supply of materials for the trials or depending on other factors, we will likely not be able to complete the trial. Even if we complete the clinical trial, the FDA may require us to undertake additional testing, or the trial results may not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval for other reasons, including inconclusive or negative results of our trials or those conducted by our competitors or other third parties. If we do not obtain FDA approval of the product use claimed in a clinical trial, we will not be able to promote the subject product for the indicated treatment of the specific disease or condition in the United States. A clinical study involving the use of our EndoMAXX EVT Valved Esophageal Stent to relieve dysphagia in patients with malignant stricture of the esophagus was completed. As a result of the data obtained during the study, it was decided that we would not pursue a 510(k) clearance to promote the device.
Changes in Cleared or Approved Devices. Certain modifications to our marketed devices, including certain manufacturing changes, product enhancements and product line extensions, require new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. For devices marketed under an approved PMA, we must submit a PMA supplement to the FDA for review and approval prior to making a change to the device that affects the safety or effectiveness of the device, including changes to the design, manufacturing or labeling of the device. Likewise, for 510(k)-cleared devices, we must obtain new FDA 510(k) clearance when there is a major change or modification in the intended use or indications for use or a change or modification of the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. In some cases, clinical data may be required to support a PMA supplement or 510(k) premarket notification for a device modification. The FDA may determine that a modified device is not substantially equivalent to the marketed device or may require that additional information, including clinical data, be submitted before a determination is made, either of which could significantly delay the introduction of modified devices.
Quality System Requirements. The FDCA requires us to comply with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and various foreign regulations require compliance with ISO 13485 or national law requirements pertaining to all aspects of our product design and manufacturing processes, including requirements for packaging, labeling, record keeping, personnel training, supplier qualification, design controls, complaint handling, corrective and preventive actions and internal auditing. The FDA and foreign regulators enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. These requirements are complex, technical and require substantial resources to remain compliant. Our failure or the failure of our suppliers to maintain compliance with these requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. If one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We also could be subject to injunctions, product seizures, or civil or criminal penalties.
Labeling and Promotion. Our labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and foreign regulators. Labeling includes not only the label on a device, but also includes any descriptive or informational literature that accompanies or is used to promote the device. Among other things, labeling violates the law if it is false or misleading in any respect or it fails to contain adequate directions for use. Moreover, product claims that are outside the approved or cleared labeling violate the FDCA and other applicable regulations. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, or otherwise violate the FDCA, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fines or criminal penalties. Allegations of off-label promotion can also result in enforcement action by federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities and trigger significant civil or criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and liability under the False Claims Act, discussed further below. 
 17

Our product promotion is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which has primary oversight of the advertising of unrestricted devices. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, as well as unfair or deceptive practices such as the dissemination of any false or misleading advertisement pertaining to medical devices. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, rescission of contracts and such other relief as the FTC may deem necessary.
In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
Import Requirements. To import a medical device into the United States, the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). All devices are subject to FDA examination before release from the CBP. Any article that appears to be in violation of the FDCA may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refuses admission, the CBP may issue a notice for redelivery and assess liquidated damages for up to three times the value of the lot. Additionally, the laws of the United States require imported articles to have their labels accurately marked with the appropriate country of origin, the violation of which may result in confiscation, fines and penalties.
Export Requirements. Products for export from Europe or the United States are subject to foreign countries' import requirements and the exporting requirements of the FDA or European regulating bodies, as applicable. In particular, international sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements and we may not be able to export such products.
Foreign countries often require, among other things, an FDA certificate for products for export, also called a Certificate to Foreign Government. To obtain this certificate from the FDA, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with the QSR at the time of the last FDA inspection.
Additionally, the export of our products to certain countries is subject to restrictions due to trade and economic sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union (the "EU") and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Under these laws and regulations, as well as other export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses and may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities.
Additional Post-market Requirements. Medical device manufacturers are also subject to other post-market requirements, including product listing and establishment regulations, compliance with the FDA’s requirements for unique device identifiers, reports of corrections and removals and other requirements. Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) requirements of the FDA, vigilance reporting requirements under the European Medical Devices Directive and similar regulations in other foreign markets, require manufacturers to report to the FDA or an equivalent foreign regulatory body any incident in which their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur. Our obligation to report under the MDR regulations is triggered on the date on which we become aware of an adverse event and the nature of the event. If we fail to comply with our MDR reporting obligations, the FDA could issue warning letters or untitled letters, take administrative actions, commence criminal prosecution, impose civil monetary penalties, revoke our device clearances, seize our products, or delay the clearance of our future products.
The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA’s regulations can result in an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusion of an inspection when an investigator has observed any conditions that may constitute violations), public warning letters, monetary penalties against a company or its officers and employees, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, injunctions, product recalls, product detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.
Foreign Regulations. Medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the United States. These laws and regulations vary significantly from country to country and range from comprehensive device approval 
 18

requirements for some or all of our medical device products to more basic requests for product data or certification. The number, scope, complexity, and cost of these requirements are increasing.
Foreign regulatory approval processes for medical devices are expensive, uncertain and lengthy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any product on a timely basis or at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Economic Area underwent a significant revision in 2017, which has introduced new regulatory requirements to obtain CE Mark approval. The new Medical Device Regulations (“MDR”) include a three-year transition period which is scheduled to end in 2020. The MDR includes increasingly stringent requirements in multiple areas, such as pre-market clinical evidence (some of which are now in effect), review of high-risk devices, labeling and post-market surveillance. Under the MDR, pre-market clinical data will now be required to obtain CE Mark approval for high-risk, new and modified medical devices. We believe these new requirements have the potential to be expensive and time-consuming to implement and maintain and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Reimbursement. Our products are generally used in medical procedures that are covered and reimbursed by governmental payers, such as Medicare, and/or private health plans. In general, these third-party payers cover a medical device and/or related procedure only when the payer determines that healthcare outcomes are supported by medical evidence and the device or procedure is medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient’s illness or injury. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA, there is no certainty that third-party payers will cover and reimburse for the cost of the device and related procedures. Because of increasing cost-containment pressures, some private payers in the U.S. and government payers in foreign countries may also condition payment on the cost-effectiveness of the device or procedure. Even if coverage is available, third-party payers may place restrictions on the circumstances in which they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products. If healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used, this may affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Affordable Care Act”) has changed the way healthcare in the United States is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has significantly affected the medical device industry. This law contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, the increased funding of comparative effectiveness research for use in healthcare decision-making, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that we believe affect existing government healthcare programs and result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices, which adversely affected our gross profit and earnings for our marketed products in 2015. The U.S. Congress suspended the excise tax for the 2016 and 2017 tax years and recently extended the suspension until January 1, 2020. We cannot predict whether any new action will be taken and whether the suspension will continue past 2020. If the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, it will likely adversely impact our future results of operations.
Additionally, the long-term viability of the Affordable Care Act, and its impact on our business and results of operations, remains uncertain. For instance, in December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, among other things, eliminated the tax penalty for not obtaining health coverage (beginning in 2019). Additionally, members of the U.S. Congress have suggested other changes that may impact individual insurance marketplaces. These and other legislative and executive initiatives may significantly change the scope and impact of the Affordable Care Act and, in turn, the medical device industry. See Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar state laws, also include annual reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers aimed at increasing the transparency of the interactions between device manufacturers and healthcare providers. Reports submitted under these new requirements are placed in a public database. Other jurisdictions outside the United States have also begun adopting similar physician transparency laws. In addition to the burden of establishing processes for compliance, if we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties.
Anti-Corruption Laws. Anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws are in place in the United States and in many jurisdictions throughout the world. In the United States, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") prohibits corruptly offering, paying, or promising to pay anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. Anti-bribery laws present particular challenges in the medical device industry because in many countries including China, hospitals are state-owned or operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign government officials. The FCPA 
 19

also requires that we maintain fair and accurate books and records and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Among other requirements to implement compliance, we are required to train our U.S. and international employees, and to train and monitor foreign third parties with whom we contract, e.g., distributors, to ensure compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Failing to comply with the FCPA or any other anti-corruption law could result in fines, penalties or other adverse consequences. In addition, the Chinese government has also sponsored anti-corruption campaigns from time to time, which could have a chilling effect on any future marketing efforts by us to new hospital customers. There have been recent occurrences in which certain hospitals have denied access to sales representatives from medical device companies because the hospitals wanted to avoid the perception of corruption. If this attitude becomes widespread among our potential customers, our ability to promote our products to hospitals may be adversely affected. 
As we expand our operations in China and other jurisdictions internationally, we will need to increase the scope of our compliance programs to address the risks relating to the potential for violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Our compliance programs will need to include policies addressing not only the FCPA, but also the provisions of a variety of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in multiple foreign jurisdictions, including China, provisions relating to books and records that apply to us as a public company, and include effective training for our personnel and relevant third-parties.
Anti-Kickback Statutes. The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to a person to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid, unless the arrangement fits within one of several statutory exemptions or regulatory “safe harbors.” The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for the manufacturer’s products. In addition, kickback arrangements can provide the basis for an action under the False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. A party’s failure to fully satisfy a regulatory “safe harbor” provision may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
Government officials have recently increased enforcement efforts on the sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies, and recently have brought cases against individuals or entities that allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers to procure their business. Settlements of these government cases have involved significant fines and penalties and, in some instances, criminal pleas.
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payers, including commercial health insurance companies.
False Claims Laws. The False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused submission of false claims. Under the Affordable Care Act, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is deemed to be a violation of the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act also includes whistleblower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the United States and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent, highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry relating to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the False Claims Act. Most states also have adopted statutes or regulations similar to the federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Sanctions under the Federal Claims Act and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
Labor Standards Laws. We are also subject to corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) laws and regulations which require us to monitor the labor standards in our supply chain, including the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act, and U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations regarding Combating Trafficking in Persons. These CSR laws and regulations may impose additional processes and supplier management systems and have led certain key customers to impose additional requirements on medical device companies, including audits, as a prerequisite to selling products to such customers, which could result in increased costs for our products, the termination or suspension of certain suppliers, and reductions in our margins and profitability.
Privacy and Security. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), and accompanying rules, require certain 
 20

entities, referred to as "covered entities" (including most healthcare providers and health plans), to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA further requires that covered entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their “Business Associates,” as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate the Business Associates to safeguard the covered entity's PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, a Business Associate may face significant statutory and contractual liability if the Business Associate breaches the agreement or causes the covered entity to fail to comply with HIPAA. Additionally, many state laws regulate the use and disclosure of health information and require notification in the event of breach of such information. 
Although we do not believe we are a “covered entity” under HIPAA and do not meet the definition of “Business Associate, we are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patients’ health information and believe that we meet the expectations of the HIPAA rules in all material respects. However, to the extent we become subject to HIPAA, whether through a change in our business model or an enforcement action brought by the U.S. government, we would be directly subject to a broader range of requirements under HIPAA, HITECH, the rules issued thereunder and their respective civil and criminal penalties.
The EU has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single EU privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all companies processing personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. In addition, it applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the processing activities are related to: (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the EU; or (b) the monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the EU. The GDPR provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the EU. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, it contains a number of opener clauses enabling the EU member states to provide for additional legislation. In addition, local data protection authorities will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements and are implementing changes to our business practices to comply with the GDPR. 

We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be materially harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, as well as public and employee health and safety. In the course of our business, we are involved in the handling, storage and disposal of certain chemicals. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the release or discharge of hazardous or other regulated materials into the environment. These environmental laws and regulations may impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others, or for acts that were in non-compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require expenditures. Environmental, health and safety legislation and regulations change frequently. Changes in those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. 
Seasonality
Our worldwide sales have not historically reflected a significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower during the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in countries in the northern hemisphere.
 21

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 4,876 people. None of our U.S. employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements; however, certain of our European employees are subject to such agreements. We believe our employee relations are generally good. Although our European employees will likely continue to be subject to collective organizing and bargaining activities, we do not expect such activities to materially affect our future operations. 
Recent Developments
On February 14, 2018, we completed the acquisition of two product lines from BD pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement, dated as of November 15, 2017 (the “BD Agreement”). The acquisition occurred in connection with BD’s acquisition of C.R. Bard, Inc. (“Bard”). The purchase price for the acquired product lines and related assets was $100.1 million, subject to adjustment for fluctuations in the value of transferred inventory. We financed the acquisition through borrowings under our existing credit facility.
Under the BD Agreement, we acquired soft tissue core needle biopsy products under the trade names of Achieve® Programmable Automatic Biopsy System, Temno® Biopsy System, and Tru-Cut® Biopsy Needles (which were previously sold by BD) as well as the Aspira® Pleural Effusion Drainage Kits and the Aspira® Peritoneal Drainage System (which were previously sold by Bard).
