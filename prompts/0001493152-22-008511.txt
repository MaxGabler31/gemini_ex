Corporate History
 
Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. (“TSOI” or the “Company”) was organized August 6, 2007 under the name Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc., under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first quarter of 2011 the Company changed its name from Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc. to Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., and acquired Splint Decisions, Inc., a California corporation.
 
On December 17, 2020, Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. Board of Directors made a decision to move our corporate headquarters to Elk City, Idaho 83525 and has purchased real property at 701 Wild Rose Lane and 50 Bullock Lane, Elk City Idaho 83525. The Company continues to maintain a satellite office at the current address of 4093 Oceanside Blvd., Suite B, Oceanside CA, 92056.
 
Business Description
 
Currently the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one’s immune system.
 
Activating one’s immune system is now an accepted method to treat certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting one’s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders aand allergic reactions.
 
TSOI is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation, traumatic brain injury, lung pathologies, and for daily health.
 
Nutraceutical Division – TSOI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its current flagship product, QuadraMune® , is a patented synergistic blend of pterostilbene, sulforaphane, epigallocatechingallate, and thymoquionone. QuadraMune has been shown to increase Natural Killer Cell activity and healthy Cytokine production. Our synergistic blend of ingredients help the immune system fight off common and complex ailments and promote healthy T Cell activity. Recently the Company was approved to sell certain nutraceuticals on the Amazon Platform.
 
Cellular Division – TSOI obtained exclusive rights to a patented adult stem cell for development of therapeutics in the area of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Lung Pathology (LP).
 
The stem cell licensed, termed “JadiCell” is unique in that it possesses features of mesenchymal stem cells, however, outperforms these cells in terms of a) enhanced growth factor production; b) augmented ability to secrete exosomes; and c) superior angiogenic and neurogenic ability.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive concussive/sub-concussive hits to the head sustained over a period of years and is often found in football players. The condition is characterized by memory loss, impulsive/erratic behavior, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, and dementia. In many patients with CTE, it is anatomically characterized by brain atrophy, reduced mass of frontal and temporal cortices, and medial temporal lobe. TSOI has previously filed several patents in the area of CTE based on modulating the brain microenvironment to enhance receptivity of regenerative cells such as stem cells. On March 4, 2021 the Company received an IND Serial # 27377 for a clinical trial of 10 patients with CTE.
 
On August 4th, 2021, the Company announced clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase III pivotal trial for registration of the Company’s JadiCell™ universal donor stem cell as a treatment for COVID-19 associated lung failure under IND # 19757. In previous studies the Company has demonstrated the superior activity of JadiCell™ to other types of stem cells including bone marrow, adipose, cord blood, and placenta. Furthermore, the JadiCell™ was shown to be 100% effective in saving the lives of COVID-19 patients under the age of 85 in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial with patients in the ICU on a ventilator. In patients over the age of 85 the survival rate was 91%.
 
In addition, the Company has filed data with the FDA, as part of IND #17448, which demonstrated that treatment of cancer patients with StemVacs™ resulted in enhanced activity of a type of immunological cell called “natural killer” cells, otherwise known as “NK cells.”
 
The Company has also developed an allogenic version of StemVacs and has filed patents to cover activating universal donor immune system cells called dendritic cells in a manner so that upon injection they reprogram the body’s NK cells.
 
Most recently the Company announced filing of a patent for a new hybrid cell created by the Company capable of training the immune system to kill blood vessels feeding cancer, but sparing healthy blood vessels. These discoveries are an extension of previous findings from the Company showing that StemVacs is capable of suppressing new blood vessel production.

Immune-Oncology – Right To Try
 
In May of 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into the law, the Right To Try bill. In 2015/2016 TSOI began and completed a 10 patient clinical trial of advanced cancer patients in Mexico at the Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center located in Tijuana Mexico using our dendritic cell vaccine code named StemVacs. TSOI has since generated GCP documentation for the previously treated 10 patients into a Phase I trial, which will be presented to the FDA by TSOI as part of an Ex-US trial compliant with 21 CFR 312.120 Foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND. This is a required step to conform to the new Right To Try law.
 
StemVacs is an immunotherapy platform that consists of 5 components. The overarching approach to the StemVacs Immunotherapy Platform is as follows:
 

1. | Treat innate immune suppression: Administration of oral apigenin/NanoStilbene (Cancer DeTox Product) to decrease immune suppressive toxic molecules made by tumor and tumor microenvironment. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Treat adaptive immune suppression: Administration of MemoryMune to activate dormant memory cells recognizing the tumor. Administration of LymphoBoost to repair deficient IL-12 production. 
3. | Stimulation of immune response to cancer stem cells (StemVacs). 
4. | Consolidation and maintenance of immunity: Cycles of StemVacs, supported by innaMune and LymphoBoost 

 
StemVacs Autologous is a subcutaneously administered vaccine comprised of immune stimulatory peptides resembling cancer stem cell specific proteins.
 
StemVacs Allogeneic is a subcutaneously administered vaccine comprised of immune stimulatory peptides resembling cancer stem cell specific proteins.
 
StemVacs-V Allogeneic is a subcutaneously administered vaccine comprised of dendritic cells generated from stem cells capable of inducing immunity towards cancer.
 
StemVacs-V Allogeneic iPSC a novel chimeric cell product generated by fusing StemVacs-V with iPSC derived endothelial cells which are cultured in a manner to make them replicate cancer stem cells. The final product is a subcutaneously administered vaccine.
 
Cancer Metabolic DeTox: This is an orally administered agent that is derived from various herbs termed apigenin. The unique property of apigenin is that it inhibits a cancer associated metabolic pathway that degrades the amino acid tryptophan. Specifically, apigenin inhibits the enzyme indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase (IDO), which is responsible for breaking down tryptophan in the vicinity of the tumor and generating by-products such as kynurenine. It is known that immune activation is dependent on tryptophan being present in the tumor environment. The depletion of tryptophan and generation of kynurenine by tumor cells and tumor associated cells is a major cause of immune suppression in cancer. By administering Cancer Metabolic DeTox, the innate arm of the immune system has a chance to regenerate. This positions the patient for better outcome after administration of specific immune stimulating vaccines.

MemoryMune: This is a product derived from a two-step culture process of donor blood cells. The product MemoryMune reawakens dormant immune memory cells. It is known that many cancer patients possess memory T cells that enter the tumor, however, once inside the tumor these cells are inactivated. MemoryMune contains a unique combination of growth factors specific for immune system cells called “cytokines”.
 
LymphoBoost: LymphoBoost is a proprietary formulation of Misoprostol, a drug approved for another indication, which we have shown to be capable of stimulating lymphocytes, particularly NK cells and T cells, both critical in maintaining anti-tumor immunity.
 
innaMune: This is a biological product derived from tissue culture of blood cells derived from healthy donors. It is a combination of cytokines that maintain activity of innate immune system cells, as well as having ability to shift M2 macrophages to M1.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and Lung Pathology.
 
On December 10, 2018, Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., announced the signing of an agreement between TSOI and Jadi Cell LLC for licensing of the Jadi Cell universal donor adult stem cell, as covered in US Patent No.: 9,803,176 B2 for use in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). In addition, on February 9, 2021 we obtained exclusive rights under the same for use of US Patent No.: 9,803,176 B2 in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other lung pathologies. The JadiCell was reported in a publication from the University of Miami following a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, demonstrating intravenous administration of JadiCells, resulted in a significant survival improvement in COVID-19 patients. The Phase 1/2 double blind, placebo-controlled trial treated 12 advanced COVID-19 patients with 100 million JadiCells™ intravenously at days 0 and 3, and 12 patients received placebo control. At 28 days 91% of JadiCell™ treated patients survived whereas only 42% of patients in the placebo group survived. There were no adverse effects associated with JadiCell™ administration. For those treated with the JadiCell under the age of 85 the survival rate was 100% and in those over 85 the survival rate was 91% making the JadiCell the most effective therapy to date in the entire world to treat ARDS.
 
The Jadi Cell product, which belongs to the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) family of cells, is a unique adult stem cell, which produces higher levels of therapeutic factors compared to other stem cells. The cells have demonstrated safety in animal models and pilot human trials. The Jadi Cell product is generated from umbilical cords, which are a source of medical waste and available in large quantities at inexpensive prices.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive concussive/sub-concussive hits to the head sustained over a period of years and is often found in football players. The condition is characterized by memory loss, impulsive/erratic behavior, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, and dementia. In many patients with CTE, it is anatomically characterized by brain atrophy, reduced mass of frontal and temporal cortices, and medial temporal lobe.
 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an insult to the brain, not of a degenerative or congenital nature, but caused by external physical force that may produce a diminished or altered state of consciousness, which results in an impairment of cognitive abilities or physical functioning.
 
CTE represents a significant unmet medical need which we believe is amenable to stem cell intervention. We are eager to accelerate treatments and potential cures for debilitating conditions such as CTE and traumatic brain injury and plan to leverage New regulatory pathways such as the recently approved “Right to Try” Law to deliver these medicines as soon as possible to patients which currently have no other options.
 
The Jadi Cell product because of its advanced stage of development in contrast to other stem cell types, which require years, if not decades of development before entry into American patients, will allow us we believe to be treating patients within 12 months. Currently means of isolating, producing, scaling up, and delivery of the cells has all been worked out by Jadi Cell and Collaborators.
 
On December 17, 2020 the Company filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application seeking permission from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety and signals of efficacy for treatment of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) patients with JadiCells™. On March 4, 2021 the Company received formal notice from FDA that our IND has been assigned serial # 27377.
 
On August 4th, 2021, the Company announced clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase III pivotal trial for registration of the Company’s JadiCell™ universal donor stem cell as a treatment for COVID-19 associated lung failure under IND # 19757. In previous studies the Company has demonstrated the superior activity of JadiCell™ to other types of stem cells including bone marrow, adipose, cord blood, and placenta. Furthermore, the JadiCell™ was shown to be 100% effective in saving the lives of COVID-19 patients under the age of 85 in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial with patients in the ICU on a ventilator. In patients over the age of 85 the survival rate was 91%.

Sars/CoV2 Clinical Programs
 
On June 8, 2020, the Company announced the initiation of a clinical trial aimed at demonstrating safety and efficacy of its immune-boosting formulation QuadraMune™. The trial is anticipated to recruit 500 subjects at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the type of coronavirus which causes COVID-19. The new clinical trial has been granted ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04421391 and is listed and registered on the Federal Clinical Trial registry.
 
The Company announced recently submission of a publication providing preclinical data which supports repositioning of its Cancer Immunotherapy StemVacs™ as a candidate for treatment of COVID-19. StemVacs™ is based on activating universal donor immune system cells called dendritic cells in a manner so that upon injection they reprogram the body’s “Natural Killer” cells.
 
Natural killer cells are the most potent cell type in the body in terms of killing viruses. Unfortunately, natural killer cells also produce chemicals called cytokines which at high concentrations can be lethal. The current data suggests that StemVacs™ can activate natural killer cells while at the same time suppressing lung inflammation. This dual mechanism of action makes StemVacs™ a promising candidate for treatment of coronavirus.
 
Schizophrenia/Suicide Clinical Programs
 
On October 29, 2020, the Company announced publication on the NIH clinical trials website of its newly initiated trial aiming to validate a blood-based diagnostic for predicting suicide risk and is listed as NCT04606875.
 
The Campbell Score™, which is a patent-pending method of quantifying inflammatory-associated biological markers, has previously been shown in pilot investigator-initiated studies to correlate with propensity for suicide. Based on positive feedback from collaborators, the Company decided to initiate a formal clinical trial to validate correlations between the Campbell Score™ and established psychiatric assessment tools of suicidal propensity. Currently the only means of quantifying predisposition to suicide is based on psychological, question-based techniques.
 
On December 31, 2020, the Company signed license agreements with Campbell Neurosciences Inc., a partially owned company, for access to the 9 patents filed related to the previous Campbell Neurosciences Division. The patents are:
