BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

General Description of the Business
Domiciled in Idaho and headquartered in the Panhandle of northern Idaho, Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (formerly New Jersey Mining Company (NJMC)) was incorporated in the State of Idaho on July 18, 1996. On December 6, 2021, The Company changed its name to Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (IDR) to better reflect its corporate focus, Idaho-based operations and being domiciled in Idaho. Idaho Strategic Resources (IDR) is one of the few resource-based companies (public or private) possessing the combination of officially recognized U.S. domestic rare earth element properties (in Idaho) and Idaho-based gold production located in an established mining community. 

Idaho Strategic Resources produces gold at the Golden Chest Mine located in the Murray Gold Belt (MGB) area of the world-class Coeur d’Alene Mining District, north of the prolific Silver Valley. With over 7,000 acres of patented and unpatented land, the Company has the largest private land position in the area following its consolidation of the Murray Gold Belt for the first time in over 100-years.

The Company is an established gold producer, with surface and underground mining operations at its 100-percent owned Golden Chest Mine and conducts milling operations at its majority-owned New Jersey Mill. The Company also has an expanded focus on identifying and exploring Critical Minerals (Rare Earth Minerals). Its business strategy is to grow its asset base and mineral production over time while advancing its Rare Earth Element projects. In addition to gold and gold production, the Company maintains an important strategic presence in the U.S. Critical Minerals sector, specifically focused on the more “at-risk” Rare Earth Elements (REE’s). The Company’s Diamond Creek and Roberts REE properties are included the U.S. national REE inventory as listed in USGS, IGS and DOE publications. Both projects are in central Idaho and participating in the USGS Earth MRI program, with the Diamond Creek Project also participating in the Idaho Department of Commerce’s IGEM program.

The Company holds mineral properties in three historic mining districts of Idaho and Montana. Its portfolio of mineral properties includes:


· | The Golden Chest Mine, a producing gold mine located in the Murray Gold Belt (MGB) of North Idaho; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A significant portfolio of early-stage exploration properties within the MGB, many of which include historic gold mines and known gold mineralization; 
· | United States Geologic Survey (USGS) recognized Rare Earth Element potential 
 | o | Diamond Creek-one of Idaho’s most prospective REE properties 
 | o | Roberts Rare Earth-one the highest grade REE properties in the US
· | A significant portfolio of early-stage exploration properties in Central Idaho, primarily in the Elk City area, and; 
· | The Butte Highlands Mine (50-percent interest), an advanced-stage project which has seen considerable development work, located south of the city of Butte, in Western Montana, however management does not expect this project to be advanced in the near future;


In addition to its portfolio of exploration, pre-development, and producing properties, the Company is also the manager and majority-owner of the New Jersey Mill, which currently processes ore from the Golden Chest Mine. The New Jersey Mill can process gold and silver ore through a 360-tonne per day flotation plant.

During the last two years, the Company has focused its efforts on expanding underground development and production at the Golden Chest Mine with an aggressive focus on consolidating and increasing its land holding within the Murray Gold Belt. With all debt associated with the start-up of operations behind it, the Company significantly increased its exploration and expansion activities in the Murray Gold Belt. This progress combined with the existing infrastructure and development over the last two years has created a solid foundation for continued growth real estate holdings, and a base of value regardless of market cycles.

Competitive Business Conditions
While there has been a market for gold and precious metals historically, the Company competes on several different fronts within the minerals exploration industry. The Company competes with other junior mining companies for the capital necessary to sustain its exploration and development programs. IDR also competes with other mining companies for exploration properties and mining assets, mostly properties in the western United States. In recent years, the Company has been successful in resuming operations at the New Jersey Mill, consolidating 100% ownership of the Golden Chest Mine, and acquiring a 50% interest in the Butte Highlands Joint Venture. In October 2016 production at the Golden Chest resumed with the Company as the sole owner and operator. While not its core business, the New Jersey Mill has little competition for contract milling within an approximate 175-mile radius.

Generally, the Company is subject to the risks inherent to the mineral industry. A primary risk of mineral exploration is the low probability of finding a major ore deposit. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by focusing its efforts in areas known to host significant mineral deposits, and also by relying on its experienced management team to drive analysis, evaluation, and acquisition of properties that it feels have a higher-than-average probability of success. In addition to deal essentials, such as cost, terms, timing, and market considerations, the Company’s process of property acquisition involves screening target properties based on geological, economic, engineering, environmental, and metallurgical factors. In all its operations the Company competes for skilled labor within the mining industry.

The risks associated with the Company’s mining and milling operations include other risks typical of the mining industry, such as: operational effectiveness in the processing plant that could result in lower recovery of the economic metals, mechanical failure of equipment that could increase costs or decrease efficacy, ability to hire and retain qualified operators, and risks that the mining operations are unable to economically extract material due to ground or slope failures that increase cost. The Company manages these risks with engineering and geologic analysis, detailed mine planning, a preventive maintenance program, and installing experienced and technically proficient management.

Another significant risk in the mining industry is the price of metals such as gold and silver. If the prices of these metals were to fall substantially, it could lead to a loss of investor interest in the mineral exploration sector, which would make it more difficult to raise the capital necessary for the Company to move exploration and development plans forward.

Customer Dependence and Product Distribution
The Company sold all its flotation gold concentrate to H&H Metals Corporation of New York, NY which accounted for 95% of gold sales in 2021. The remaining gold sales were gold dore’ which was sold to a western U.S. refinery. H&H Metals is also an IDR shareholder. Although not expected, if H&H Metals could not purchase the gold concentrate, it is anticipated another customer could be found readily as the floatation gold concentrate is a high-value concentrate with minor deleterious element content.

The Company ships its gold concentrate overseas to a smelter in Japan and the recent global shipping problems due to Covid-19 have caused an increase of inventory of gold concentrate at the New Jersey Mill. Only one day has been allowed for loading vessels in Seattle making it nearly impossible to ship from Idaho. Management is working to set up a concentrate storage area near the Port of Seattle so that several 20-tonne lots of concentrate could be stored closer to the port and loaded on a vessel in the short time currently allowed for loading.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
The mining business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing development, production, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, the use of toxic substances, environmental regulations, mine safety and other matters. The Company is subject to potential risks and liabilities occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. Insurance against environmental risk (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production) is not generally available to the Company (or to other companies in the minerals industry) at a reasonable price. To the extent that the Company becomes subject to environmental liabilities, the satisfaction of any such liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Laws and regulations intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive.

All operating and exploration plans have been made in consideration of existing governmental regulations. Regulations that most affect operations are related to surface water quality and access to public lands. An approved plan of operations (POO) and a financial bond are usually required before exploration or mining activities can be conducted on public land that is administered by the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or United States Forest Service (USFS).

The New Jersey Mine, Golden Chest Mine, and other nearby properties are part of the expanded Bunker Hill Superfund Site. Current plans for expanded cleanup do not include any IDR projects. There is no known evidence that previous operations at the New Jersey Mine (prior to 1910) caused any groundwater or surface water pollution or discharged any tailings into the South Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River; however, it is possible that such evidence could surface. Should such a liability emerge for the Company, its exposure would likely be to clean up or cover old mine tailings that may have washed downstream from upstream mining operations. There are no mineral processing tailings deposits at the Golden Chest Mine. However, at least two old adits have small water discharges. The Company could conceivably be required to conduct cleanup operations at its own expense, however, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Record of Decision for the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Operating Unit 3 does not include any cleanup activities at the Company’s projects. Recently, the EPA has proposed a new cleanup plan that greatly increases the number of historic mine sites to be reclaimed, however, the plan has not been approved. IDR has not received any notifications that it could be liable for any environmental cleanup.

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws (Federal, State and Local)
No major Federal permits are required for the Golden Chest and New Jersey Mines because the operations are on private land and there are no process discharges to surface waters. However, any exploration program conducted by the Company on unpatented mining claims, usually administered by the BLM or USFS, requires a POO to be submitted. The Company’s exploration programs on public land can be delayed for significant periods of time (one to two years) because of the slow permitting process applied by the USFS. The Company believes that such permitting delays are caused by insufficient manpower, complicated regulations, competing priorities, and sympathy for environmental groups who oppose all mining projects.

The Company is also subject to the rules of the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for the New Jersey and Golden Chest operations. When an underground mine or mill is operating, MSHA performs a series of regular quarterly inspections to verify compliance with mine safety laws, and can assess financial penalties for violations of MSHA regulations. A typical mine citation order for a violation that is not significant or substantial is about $200.

The New Jersey Mine and Mill have two important State of Idaho permits. The first is an Idaho Cyanidation Permit and the second is a reclamation plan for surface mining operations. The Company has also applied for a permit to expand its tailings storage facility (TSF) with the Idaho Department of Water Resources. Once approved, the Company will have to post a reclamation bond of approximately $110,000. If not approved in a timely manner, the Company would have to dispose of tailings in with a slightly more expensive method such as backhauling tailings to the Golden Chest Mine. An Idaho cyanidation permit was granted October 10, 1995 [No. CN-000027]. Construction of the Concentrate Leach Plant (CLP) at the New Jersey Mill was completed in November of 2007. The Idaho Cyanidation permit requires quarterly surface water and groundwater monitoring during the operation of the CLP. IDR estimates the cost of water-monitoring associated with the CLP to be approximately $6,000 per year. The New Jersey Mill also has an EPA general stormwater permit.

The Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) approved a surface mining reclamation plan for the New Jersey Mine in 1993. The plan calls for grading of steep fill slopes and planting of vegetation on the area disturbed by the open pit mine. IDR pays an annual reclamation fee of $133 to the Idaho Department of Lands for surface disturbance associated with the New Jersey Mine open pit. The Company has estimated its costs to reclaim the New Jersey Mine and Mill site to be $96,600. The Company submitted a reclamation plan to the IDL for its current open pit mining operation at the Golden Chest Mine. The plan was approved, and the Company was required to post a reclamation bond of $103,320. This plan also calls for the grading of steep fill slopes and re-vegetation of disturbed land as well as erosion control measures utilizing best practices. The Golden Chest Mine also has an EPA stormwater permit.

When the Company plans an exploration drilling program on public lands, it must submit a POO to either the BLM or USFS. Compilation of the plan can take several days of professional time and a reclamation bond is usually required to start drilling once the plan is approved. Bond costs vary directly with surface disturbance area, but a small, single set-up drilling program usually requires a bond amount of approximately $5,000. If a plan requires road building, the bond amount can increase significantly. Upon completion of site reclamation and approval by the managing agency, the bond is returned to the Company.

The Company complies with local building codes and ordinances as required by law.

Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
The Company’s total number of full-time employees is 38.
