Item 1. Business
Overview
 Alkame Holdings, Inc. is a publicly traded health and wellness technology holding company, with a focus on patentable, innovative, and eco-friendly consumer products utilizing a patented unique water treatment technology. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries are diligently pursuing multiple applications to utilize its Intellectual Property by focusing our efforts on several emerging business sectors, such as the prepared and prepackaged food and beverage mixes, the growing aqua-culture industry, consumer food & beverage products, household pet products, horticulture and agriculture, medical, health & beauty, as well as a number of water-based applications to both new and existing business platforms. Our holding company can provide the infrastructure, protective umbrella and transparency of a publicly listed company to acquisition candidates through their incubation and provides the delivery mechanism for these alternative and innovative methods, products, and systems that will lead to healthier lifestyles and result in a more sustainable planet. Our principal executive offices are located at 3651 Lindell Road, Suite D # 356, Las Vegas, Nevada 89103, and our telephone number is (702) 273-9714.
 On April 21, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Definitive Agreement (the Agreement) with Xtreme Technologies, Inc., an Idaho corporation (Xtreme). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Xtreme in exchange for certain consideration as set forth in the Agreement.
 
On January 16, 2015, the parties to the Agreement entered into an amendment (the Amendment) that changed, among other things, the Closing Date of the transaction. 
 
On April 15, 2015, the parties to the Agreement entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment) that changed, among other things, the 120-day time period to pay monetary consideration under the Agreement to 240 days after the Closing Date of the transaction. 
 
In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the Amendment and the Second Amendment, we agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Xtreme for the purchase price of $2,000,000, payable as follows:
 

A cash payment of $50,000 has been previously paid as a non-refundable deposit; 
 
The Closing Date is effective as of January 13, 2015; 
 
An additional cash payment of $525,000 shall be paid within two hundred and forty (240) days of the Closing Date, which, along with the initial $50,000 deposit, shall pay the obligations on Xtremes balance sheet; 
 
The balance of $1,425,000 shall be payable by the issuance of shares of the Companys Series C Preferred Stock to be divided pro rata among the Companys shareholders of record as of the Closing Date. The Series C Preferred Stock shall include an option to convert each share of Series C Preferred Stock into one share of the Companys Common Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock shall be held in escrow along with the issued and outstanding shares of Xtremes capital stock pending the full payment of $525,000. As of the date of this report, the balance of $525,000 has been fully paid to Xtreme; and 
 
One of Xtremes previous officers and directors holds outstanding options to purchase up to 1,009,000 shares of Xtremes common stock at the price of $0.10 per share. At the Closing Date, pursuant to Idaho law, Xtreme shall notify this previous officer and director of his 30-day right to exercise any or all of his remaining options. If he elects to exercise any of his options within such 30-day period, the Company agrees to issue additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock in exchange for such Xtreme shares. Xtreme notified the option holder and the 30-day period expired unanswered. The options expired unexercised. 
 
The Amendment also requires that the Company guarantee the obligations on employment agreements for Xtremes key employees, namely, Keith Fuqua, Timm Ott and Casey Henry. The employment agreements with Messrs. Fuqua, Ott and Henry have the terms set forth in the following table.

Employee | Position | Term | Compensation | Commission | Benefits | Severance 
------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keith Fuqua | Operations Director | One year | $70,000 annually and annual bonus | 5% on gross sales made to Walmart | Benefit plans | 6 months severance for termination in certain instances; residual commissions for 1 year
Timm Ott | Sales and Marketing Director and Treasurer | One year | $2,700 per month salary and annual bonus | $1.00 per case of product sold | Benefit plans | 6 months severance for termination in certain instances 
Casey Henry | Manufacturing Director | One year | $4,350 per month and annual bonus | $1.00 per case of product sold | Benefit plans | 6 months severance for termination in certain instances 

 
In addition, after the Closing Date, Xtremes current officers and directors, namely, Jeffery J. Crandall, John N. Marcheso and Michael J. Bibin, shall continue to serve in that capacity until the $525,000 is paid in full. Our President and CEO, Robert K. Eakle and two (2) additional representatives of our company shall be appointed as directors of Xtreme and shall serve together with the other directors until the $525,000 is paid in full. In addition, Mr. Eakle shall be named as President and Chief Executive Officer of Xtreme. Until the $525,000 is paid in full, the officers and directors of Xtreme shall not make any material change in the companys business and operations without unanimous consent of the directors. By January 2017, the $525,000 was fully paid and the appointments of Mr. Eakle and the other two representatives as interim officers and directors became permanent. Prior to completion of the payment of $525,000 in full to Xtreme, all former officers and directors of Xtreme had resigned and full control of Xtreme was be tendered to us. Given that certain representations were accurate, Jeffery J. Crandall, John N. Marcheso and Michael J. Bibin were released by us and Xtreme from any liability as officers and directors of Xtreme for their fiduciary obligations occurring prior to the Closing Date.
 
We previously held a three-year limited exclusive distribution agreement with Xtreme for the consumer market. We were permitted to distribute the technologically enhanced bottled water in the consumer market in the United States, Canada and Mexico. As a result of the Agreement, Amendment, and Second Amendment, Xtreme became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we acquired the patents on the proprietary process that we believe is the most technologically advanced in water treatment systems for complete hydration. We will now assume the operations of Xtreme and continue its business of distributing technologically enhanced bottled water.
 
Upon closing of the acquisition, we discovered that Xtreme was operating at a loss for the prior year and that it required a substantial cash infusion. We began a program of upgrading the production line, reorganized personnel, and began an effort to increase sales of the division so that it would return to profitability as quickly as possible. However, as 2015 progressed, it became obvious that changes in contracts negotiated prior to our acquisition were no longer profitable and we terminated the agreements with those customers. In mid-2017, the Company determined that Xtreme was no longer an asset as an operating company and closed the facility and moved the operations to a new location in the state of Oregon. 
 Our primary objective now is to introduce, promote, aggressively market and establish channels of distribution to sell a variety of products to a wide range of consumers and business sectors, first in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and then globally. In addition, the Company is moving in the direction of bottling or co-packing. To that end, the Company, in 2017 moved to Oregon and started a new subsidiary, Bell Food and Beverage, Inc., for the production of hot pack foods and beverages and relocated all of its production equipment and inventory to the same location from which it now operates. 
 We believe that holding the acquired patents provide a competitive edge in the water treatment market, allowing us to expand our reach in the distribution of water and other complementary products, and enables us to enhance our position in the investment community.

Our Water Product
 With the public becoming more aware of the benefits of a living water. The mild alkalinity of Alkame is recommended by numerous athletes and doctors because its formulated for more effective hydration by supporting an optimal pH balanced water. Alkame water is produced with a patented technology and patented formula that alters the structure of water, producing a combination of unique characteristics.
 Today our water is pumped from wells that tap into the Columbia aquifer, located in the heart of the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Our water is not treated with chlorine, fluorides, or any other harmful contaminants. This source water is then run through up to 14 different filters, reverse osmosis, and UV to remove any particulates and harmful contaminants, rendering a pure, clean, healthier water which can then be used as a base for multiple applications. We believe our water advances beyond other brands once we introduce the technology, which includes manipulation of the pH levels, structure size, ionization, as well as an increased bioavailable oxygen content. This proprietary system creates a unique micro-clustered alkaline water, providing additional health benefits.
 Alkame Water, our flagship brand and water product, was developed as a vehicle to get the word out about the technology, and that it can be applied across a diverse and wide-ranging spectrum of businesses and water-based applications. Alkame Water started with 3 phases of initial bottled water products and has currently completed 2 of these 3 Phases. 1 was to develop the initial move into the consumer market consisting of half liter and one-liter bottles. Phase 2 was the development of new packaging configurations and an increased offering with a full range of sizes to boost the cross marketability, co-branding, and private label options for our products. In phase 2 we rounded out our product lines to now consist of 16.9oz, 20oz, 33.8oz, 50.7oz, 128oz, 135.25oz configurations. Phase 3 has been updated and corrected to reflect the true direction of this unique water brand, how it can be applied to a larger multitude of products and various business sectors. Today we are focused on the development and expansion of its utilization in multiple products through co-packing and private label business, as well as expanding the distribution footprint of the Alkame brand and its technologically superior water technology.
 The Benefits of the Technology
 The Alkame Technology has proven benefits that go way beyond just being wet, which is why we trademarked the tagline The Ultimate Health & Wellness Water. Our advanced hydration technology is advancing us into other market segments outside of the bottled water consumer markets. Our system will process, clean, and reduce water, lower its TDS (total dissolved solids), increase its pH, provide antioxidant protection, and increase the amount of bio-available oxygen. We believe Alkame is the only product of its kind and stands completely apart from other waters.
 Alkame Water has an elevated level of dissolved oxygen and lower oxidation reduction potential (ORP) due to passage through an electrolytic cell and has a level of dissolved oxygen additionally elevated due to passage through a sparging unit comprising of 1) dissolved oxygen within the range of 20 to 60 parts per million and 2) an ORP between +100 to -350mV (micro-clustered), and coupled with a pH level averaging 8 to 8.5pH (alkaline). 
 The Alkame Technology helps support an optimum pH balance and reduce the negative impact of acid in the body, provide antioxidant protection from this energy-robbing oxidative damage, and effectively maximize blood oxygen levels with an efficient delivery mechanism to every part of your body allowing for a more complete hydration, especially when that is coupled with electrolyte and other form of enhancements. Maximized blood oxygen levels mean improved metabolic efficiency, which translates into more energy and improved vitality. If you wish to overcome fatigue and boost energy, it is essential that you achieve and maintain optimal hydration. By maximizing your blood oxygen saturation, and an alkaline pH, and antioxidant support, you can improve digestion, metabolic function, immune response, and healing. Supporting an efficient metabolism will help you maintain the level of energy and vitality desired. When free radicals become too numerous, they become highly destructive, damaging cells and tissue of muscles and vital organs. If your bodys processes are impaired, the first place you start to feel the effects is in your vitality and energy levels. Alkame is a powerful source, which boosts the immune system, improves aerobic capacity, is good for overall health, and enhances energy and overall vitality.

Today, we are employing our technology to multiple companies across a diverse spectrum of applications in the consumer market segment. To continue our cross-marketing efforts, there has been a wide array of products being released into the market by our manufacturing subsidiaries, co-branded with a Powered by Alkame Technology icon. This has helped us both further our reach, as well as enable more people to enjoy the benefits of our technology. 
 The Market
 
With the massive influx of new eco-friendly products, consumers are going green, both externally as well as internally. The well-being generation and others have become increasingly aware of what they are consuming, and this new technology for water treatment is quite the prized possession for those looking to optimize their health. Our ability to incorporate other elements from electrolytes to supplements including hemp is where we believe well see expansion over the next few years. We expect Alkame to be a significantly improved delivery mechanism due to its micro-clustered structure. The market for these types of products are gaining traction and becoming synonymous with good health and proper hydration, and we intend to be the first household technology name for superior products utilizing this type of water treatment technology.
 The market for this technology is expansive since there are so many products and businesses that utilize water and water treatment technology in one form or another. We have driven into the human and household pet sectors, with brands we created, co-branded products, and private label business. The hemp space is huge, and we are one of the top production houses for manufacturing these types of products. We delved into the aquaculture market with a lot of scientific research on the efficacy of this application, which looks very promising. We recently received our aquaculture license from the state of Oregon and are looking to have a small active fish farm to be utilized as a proof of concept to show large format producers for the scalability of the technology and its introduction into the aquaculture sector. We are now exploring medical applications which also look very promising.
 Beginning in 2017, we began making some very strategic moves behind the scenes to position ourselves as the wheel house and primary incubator for both new and emerging product and brand development. Our move to Oregon, and the added influx of capabilities and options, are really the driving factor in the success we are seeing now. As the manufacturer, our ability to create brands and products for both ourselves and others really creates an almost limitless amount of opportunities in a multitude of markets and sectors. We are seeing expansion on all fronts because of this strong move towards expanding the production capabilities. Our ability to get hemp-based products through both the state process authorities as well as the FDA makes us a force to be reckoned with in todays markets.
 Competition and Feasibility
 The Company competes on the basis of product quality and customer service. The Company believes that the products' Alkaline, Antioxidant and Oxygenated features, along with its superior taste, and attractive packaging options are significant factors in maintaining the Company's competitive position. We believe we have a superior product with more features and sell on the benefits and functions, not the price. We believe our ability to incorporate additional supplemental materials using this water as the base can provide a more efficient delivery mechanism, has enabled us to exploit this technology by offering it to others to be utilized in their products. Co-branding with the Powered by Alkame Technology enables us to continue to utilize all of these products as vehicles to get the word out about the technology, and not solely on our brand alone. Since we have repositioned ourselves as the production house, the competition dynamic changes dramatically in our favor. 
 Experiments on the Technology
 The technology for alkaline bottled water has undergone separate double-blind placebo, peer backed research. One was with HIV patients and the other was on Exercise Tolerance. The feasibility of the product is clearly evident, and we believe there is no major competition to date.

Based on the study with HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy it was concluded that drinking sufficient quantities of Alkame water improves important parameters of health in individuals infected with HIV. Drinking Alkame provides a significant boost to the immune system as shown by an increase in CD4 T cells (which are the primary targets of HIV and are crucial for immune defense against infections) and a decrease in the total virus load of HIV patients.
 Based on the Exercise Tolerance study, the amount and the type of water consumed during rehab revealed a difference in the patients aerobic endurance. We found that drinking one liter of electrolyzed alkaline water is more beneficial than drinking three liters of plain water, which is great news for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with congestive heart failure. In light of our study, Kern Rehab henceforth furnishes one liter of electrolyzed alkaline water for each patient participating in our comprehensive outpatient pulmonary rehab facility. The reason being, 3 liters of plain water per day exhibited 12.4% MET improvement in the exercise and fitness level per 6-minute walk /12-week program, whereas, 1-liter of electrolyzed alkaline water exhibited 17.8% MET improvement.
 Effects of Alkame Water on blood lactate following exercise in a recent double-blind study conducted by Athletic Lab in North Carolina, under the supervision of Mike Young provided scientific evidence that Alkame Water will lower lactic acid accumulation during repetitive sprints/ interval training. Blood lactate was taken before and after the conclusion of the sprints using a Lactate Plus monitor from Nova Biomedical under a standardized warm up and exercise protocol. Results of the T-tests showed that hydrating your workout with Alkame water lowers maximum exercise heart rate and lactic acid accumulation during repetitive sprints/ interval training. Less fatigue, quicker recovery between intervals and less soreness after your workouts means you'll be training hard, longer while staying hydrated.
 Outside of the effects on consumers, the company also tested the water treatment technology in aquaculture fish farming by studying its effects on Tilapia specifically. The major advantage of Alkame technology is that it can completely or partially destroy organics in water by converting them into various harmless intermediates and end products. Alkames advanced system and design ensures that high concentrations of dissolved oxidants are released to the water when circulated across the cells, reducing Nitrites by 50%. Clarity and solids were also substantially reduced from 4 inches to over 20 inches after oxidation within 48 hours. Tannins and Lignins from feed leaching were removed with the Alkame process along with organic solids creating clearer and healthier water conditions. These factors could substantially reduce the size and costs of bio-filtration design for intensive recirculation systems. Our studies show that the Alkame Technology aids in the overall health of the water, which in turn creates a healthier environment to raise the fish. The Tilapia benefit by lowering the mortality rate (less than 2% mortality), accelerating growth (1 gram to about 38 to 50 grams in less than 60 days), and by reducing the size and cost to the bottom line of bio-filtration efficiency. Producing a cleaner healthier water for the Tilapia is a game changer for Aquaculture systems, and the industry worldwide. 
 Sales and Marketing
 
Originally, our primary focus was on exposing the product and building brand name recognition and technology awareness through Alkames utilization of celebrity and athletic ambassadors, cross-marketing and co-branding, and via sponsorships of key existing and potential clients (mostly in the health & wellness fields and athletic markets). A special and unique emphasis is placed on action sports to build on its cool factor. Although these techniques did not directly translate into sales and distribution, the utilization of mass media and celebrity endorsement provided our sales teams with the most essential marketing and sales tools and support needed to move product to distributors, as well as drive it through three main channels of on premise, off-premise, and special events.
 
Advertising, public relations and promotions are the life blood of any company and by far one of our strongest attributes. As we developed new product lines, the icons associated with our new products and brand trademarks was used consistently and accurately to achieve the goal we set. How we visually communicated our product to the world, the market, and our potential clients was an integral part of the success we are seeing now. Consistent usage of style and identity gave the world an impression that can be easily remembered through these various media and materials such as product placement, endorsements, sponsorships, advertorials and editorials, advertisements, marketing collateral, signage, the web, etc. Current trends and new marketing techniques utilizing out of the box thinking, and targeted promotional strategies to increase publicity and public relations awareness has been an essential tool for us,

along with the high level of service we use in marketing our products and services to our customers. The combined concentration of expertise and experience of the Alkame team is the key to giving us a real shot at being able to compete with the biggest players in the industry. The other key component, and by far the most invaluable to our success, is our customers. With the rapidly growing awareness of health and longevity, Alkame is a perfect fit.
 
Governmental Regulation 
 
The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates bottled water as a food. Accordingly, our bottled water must meet, and we do meet FDA requirements of safety for human consumption, of processing and distribution under sanitary conditions and of production in accordance with the FDA good manufacturing practices. To assure the safety of bottled water, the FDA has established quality standards that address the substances that may be present in water which may be harmful to human health as well as substances that affect the smell, color and taste of water. These quality standards also require public notification whenever the microbiological, physical, chemical or radiological quality of bottled water falls below standard. The labels affixed to bottles and other packaging of the water is subject to FDA restrictions on health and nutritional claims for foods under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. In addition, all drinking water must meet Environmental Protection Agency standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment that are enforced by the FDA.
 
We are subject to the food labeling regulations required by the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act of 1990. We believe we are in compliance with these regulations.
 
We are subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA. Upon inspection, we must be in compliance with all aspects of the quality standards and good manufacturing practices for bottled water, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and all other applicable regulations that are incorporated in the FDA quality standards. We believe that we meet the current regulations of the FDA. All of our plants and distribution locations are registered with the FDA under the "Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002". Most recently, the FDA put into effect the Bottled Water Microbial Rule to monitor water sources for E. coli bacteria. We have been in compliance with the testing requirements for this rule prior to and since its inception in December 2009.
 
We also must meet state regulations in a variety of areas to comply with purity, safety, and labeling standards. From time to time, our facilities and sources are inspected by various state departments and authorities.
 
Our product labels are subject to state regulation (in addition to federal requirements) in each state where the water products are sold. These regulations set standards for the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made.
 
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of proposed legislative and executive action in state and local governments that would ban the use of bottled water in municipal buildings, enact local taxes on bottled water, and limit the sale by municipalities of water supplies to private companies for resale. Such regulation could adversely affect our business and financial results. For additional information, see Risk Factors below.
 
The laws that regulate our activities and properties are subject to change. As a result, there can be no assurance that additional or more stringent requirements will not be imposed on our operations in the future. Although we believe that our water supply, products and bottling facilities are in substantial compliance with all applicable governmental regulations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other Applications
 
We are exploring other uses of our water so that we can diversify our portfolio of products to include other specialty uses outside of the bottled water and health water markets.
Employees
 We currently are working with various independent consultants and sales representatives, with a total infrastructure of approximately 25 people.
