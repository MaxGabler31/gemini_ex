Item 1.         Business
OVERVIEW

The Company

We are a Bermuda exempted limited liability company that, through our subsidiaries, provides collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market and invests in various insurance-linked securities. We were incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on June 24, 2013 and we commenced operations on November 12, 2013. Our headquarters and principal executive offices are located at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda, which is also our registered office.
Our Common Shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BCRH" and on the Bermuda Stock Exchange under the symbol "BCRH.BH."
Our largest shareholder, Sompo International, is a holding company headquartered in Bermuda which through its operating subsidiaries focuses on underwriting specialty lines of personal and commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance on a global basis. Sompo International together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. ("Endurance Bermuda"), owned 33.2% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares as of December 31, 2018. 
Our business strategy is to build and maintain a diversified portfolio of reinsurance risks that are intended to generate underwriting profits, which we intend principally to distribute to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, with returns commensurate with the amount of risk assumed. We seek to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to own an alternative asset class whose returns we believe have historically been largely uncorrelated to those of other asset classes, such as global equities and bonds. Subject to the discretion of our board of directors (the "Board"), we intend to distribute a minimum of 90% of our annual Distributable Income to holders of our Common Shares. "Distributable Income," a non-GAAP measure, means our GAAP net income plus (minus) non-cash expenses (revenues) recorded in our net income for the period. Subject to the discretion of the Board, we intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments for each of the first three quarters of each year, and either repurchase Common Shares or pay a special dividend after the end of the year should funds be available. See "Overview" contained in Item 7 herein.

We operate as a single business segment through our wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Blue Capital Re, a Bermuda exempted limited liability company registered as a Class 3A insurer in Bermuda under the Insurance Act, which provides collateralized reinsurance; and (ii) Blue Capital Re ILS, a Bermuda exempted limited liability company which conducts hedging and other investment activities, including entering into industry loss warranties and purchasing catastrophe bonds, in support of Blue Capital Re’s operations.

Subsidiaries of Sompo International manage our reinsurance underwriting decisions and provide us with the services of our CEO and CFO. Through this relationship, we leverage Sompo International’s reinsurance underwriting expertise and infrastructure to conduct our business.
The Property Reinsurance Market

Property insurance companies issue insurance policies in exchange for premiums paid by the policyholder. An insurance policy is a contract between the insurance company and the policyholder whereby the insurance company agrees to pay for losses suffered by the policyholder that are covered under that contract. Property insurance typically covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to the policyholder’s property due to natural and man-made catastrophes, subject to deductibles and other policy limitations. Casualty insurance mainly protects a person or a business against legal liability for losses caused by injury to other people or the property of others. Many insurance policies will cover both property and casualty risks. However, given the difference in nature between property and casualty risks, the reinsurance markets for these types of risks tend to be separate and distinct. Our reinsurance activities focus predominately on property risks.

Property reinsurance companies assume, from both insurance companies (known as "ceding companies" or "cedants") and other reinsurance companies (known as "retrocedants"), as well as other property insurance capital providers, such as government or state-sponsored catastrophe funds, all or a portion of the property insurance or reinsurance risks that the ceding company or retrocedant has underwritten under one or more insurance or reinsurance policies. In return, the reinsurer receives a premium for the risks assumed from the ceding company or retrocedant. When reinsurance companies purchase reinsurance to cover their own risks assumed from ceding companies, this is known as "retrocessional reinsurance." Reinsurance or

retrocessional reinsurance can benefit a ceding company or retrocedant, as applicable, in various ways, such as by reducing exposure to individual risks and by providing catastrophe protection from larger or multiple losses. Ceding companies and retrocedants can use reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance to manage their overall risk profile or to create additional underwriting capacity, allowing them to accept larger risks or to write more business than would otherwise be possible, absent an increase in their capital or surplus.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe we have the following competitive strengths:


• | Access to a Global Specialty Provider of Property and Casualty Insurance and Reinsurance with an Extensive Infrastructure. We benefit substantially from the Manager’s relationship with Sompo International by accessing and leveraging Sompo International’s management talent, proprietary reinsurance modeling tools, underwriting expertise, proprietary risk management systems and longstanding broker/client relationships. The Manager’s affiliation with Sompo International enables us to deploy our capital to build a diversified portfolio of reinsurance risks with an attractive risk-adjusted return potential for our shareholders. We also benefit from Sompo International’s scale, experience and reputation in pricing reinsurance contracts and achieving key policy terms and conditions, which we believe is a competitive advantage relative to other independent or small reinsurance platforms. We further benefit from Sompo International’s existing middle- and back-office support infrastructure.


• | Differentiated Approach to Reinsurance Risk Selection. The Manager performs our risk selection process, subject to the oversight of the Board, and primarily targets counterparties who can supply us with the full spectrum of information associated with each exposure. Our risk selection process includes using the Manager’s specific knowledge of the ceding insurer and underlying risks, including detailed portfolio data, such as home type, location, building code and date of construction. Additionally, the Manager analyzes the historical loss performance of the ceding insurer, its market position, its management’s capabilities and its claims mitigation history. The Manager generally acts as a "quoting market" participant, which means that it provides an initial quote to the broker rather than responding to quotes provided by the broker. We believe that this allows the Manager to be more selective in choosing the reinsurance contracts it selects for us and enhances its relationship with brokers. We benefit from the Manager’s use of Sompo International’s analytics, risk management and actuarial team, which enables the Manager to analyze the granular data collected using proprietary analytical systems on our behalf in order to determine the appropriate pricing for the risks assumed. The Manager uses its and Sompo International’s proprietary catastrophe pricing and risk management systems, various third-party models and its underwriting judgment in order to build a high quality portfolio. The Manager also seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies that may exist in the market from time to time.


• | Access to Reinsurance Products Not Generally Available to Collateralized Reinsurers. In addition to offering collateralized reinsurance directly to third-party insurance and reinsurance companies, we further benefit from leveraging our relationship with Sompo International in order to gain access to a broader range of reinsurance business than we believe is typically available to most collateralized reinsurers. Through a retrocessional contract (the "BW Retrocessional Agreement"), between Blue Capital Re and Blue Water Re, Blue Water Re has the option to cede to Blue Capital Re up to 100% of its participation in the ceded reinsurance business it writes, provided that such business is in accordance with Blue Capital Re’s underwriting guidelines. Pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement, we participate in: (i) retrocessional, quota share or other agreements between Blue Water Re and Sompo International or other third-party reinsurers, which provide us with the opportunity to participate in a diversified portfolio of risks on a proportional basis; and (ii) fronting agreements between Blue Water Re and Sompo International or other well capitalized third-party rated reinsurers, which allow us to transact business with counterparties who prefer to enter into contracts with rated reinsurers. These arrangements enhance the depth of opportunities available to us, increase the diversification of our portfolio and provide enhanced risk-adjusted returns compared to most other collateralized reinsurers.


• | Experienced Management Team. Our CEO and CFO, as well as Sompo International’s senior managers responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the Manager, have significant experience in the reinsurance industry, including the supervision of both traditional reinsurance markets and insurance-linked securities. We also benefit from the significant experience of the Manager’s Investment and Underwriting Committees.


• | Alignment of Interests Between Our Shareholders and Sompo International. Sompo International currently owns 33.2% of our outstanding Common Shares. We believe that Sompo International’s significant investment in us and our relationship with the Manager aligns Sompo International’s interests with those of our shareholders and incentivizes Sompo International to maximize returns, while managing risks, for our shareholders.

Our Strategy

Our business strategy is to build and maintain a diversified portfolio of reinsurance risks that will generate underwriting profits, which we intend principally to distribute to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, with returns commensurate with the amount of risk assumed. We implement our strategy through our subsidiaries Blue Capital Re and Blue Capital Re ILS. Blue Capital Re provides collateralized reinsurance and enters into industry loss warranties in the form of insurance contracts. Blue Capital Re ILS conducts hedging and other investment activities, including investing in insurance-linked securities, in support of Blue Capital Re’s operations.

We aim to maintain a balanced portfolio of predominantly, but not exclusively, natural and man-made catastrophe risks, diversified by peril, geography and attachment point. The Manager selects risks on our behalf, primarily from the global property catastrophe reinsurance market. Our strategy is to build and maintain a flexible and diversified portfolio of reinsurance risk exposures by pursuing a broad range of reinsurance opportunities. We believe that allocations to traditional reinsurance contracts, either fronted or collateralized by trust account or letter of credit, industry loss warranties, catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities enhance our overall risk diversification and offer attractive relative value at different points in time, depending on market conditions. The Manager uses Sompo International’s sophisticated risk management techniques to monitor correlation risk, and it seeks to enhance our underwriting returns through careful risk selection using advanced capital allocation methodologies. We also actively seek to write more business in classes that we consider to be favorably priced based on the risk-adjusted return potential and to avoid those classes that we consider to be comparatively unfavorably priced, such as those suffering from intense price competition or poor fundamentals. We believe a balanced portfolio of risks reduces the volatility of returns and optimizes value for our shareholders. From time to time, however, we may choose to be overweight in certain classes, products or geographies based on market opportunities.
Quota Share Retrocessional Agreements with Sompo International or Other Third-Party Reinsurers

Blue Capital Re participates in quota share retrocessional reinsurance agreements with Sompo International pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement, or directly with other sophisticated reinsurance or insurance companies (those with either a minimum A.M. Best financial strength rating of "A-" (Excellent) or better (or an equivalent rating with another recognized rating agency)), or insurers and reinsurers that are not rated or do not fall within this threshold on a case-by-case basis . These agreements allow Blue Capital Re to participate in an agreed percentage of the risks and premiums of certain reinsurance contracts on a proportional basis, with exposure capped at the amount of collateral required to support the contract. In exchange, the ceding reinsurer charges Blue Capital Re a commission override, which is a percentage of the premiums on these contracts, to compensate it for sourcing the business and retaining the tail risk (meaning the amount of proportional contractual limits in excess of collateral required) of these reinsurance contracts. The ceding reinsurer is also reimbursed for acquisition costs, including brokerage and federal excise taxes, and may receive a profit commission in the event of favorable loss experience. These arrangements are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, allowing Blue Capital Re to partake either in a portion or the entirety of the reinsurer’s portfolio or only in certain classes of reinsurance, as determined by the Manager, subject to our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board.

Third-Party Reinsurance, Direct with Cedant or via a Fronting Arrangement

Blue Capital Re also provides reinsurance to third-party insurance and reinsurance companies through reinsurance contracts, either directly with the cedant or on a fronted basis. Blue Capital Re’s exposure under these reinsurance contracts is calculated on an ultimate net loss basis, ultimate net loss meaning the actual loss or losses paid out by the cedant or retrocedant and for which the cedant or retrocedant has become liable in respect of insurance policies entered into by the cedant as an insurer or reinsurer. Generally, cedants decide to cede business to a reinsurer based on the quality of a reinsurer’s financial strength rating or, if it is unrated, on the demonstrated ability of a reinsurer to cover claims. Blue Capital Re fully collateralizes its reinsurance obligations. The collateral is held in trust for the term of the related contract (or, in the event of a covered loss, until the resolution of any claims under the contract).

As an alternative to the collateralized markets, Blue Capital Re also participates in fronting arrangements, either through the BW Retrocessional Agreement or directly with other well capitalized third-party rated reinsurers that satisfy the Manager’s detailed credit review. Under a typical fronting arrangement, a rated insurer issues an insurance policy on behalf of an unrated, often cash-collateralized, reinsurer without the intention of retaining any of the risk. The economic risk remains with the unrated reinsurer via an indemnity/reinsurance agreement but the contractual and credit risk is assumed by the fronting company since it is required to honor obligations under the policy if the unrated reinsurer fails to indemnify the fronting company.

7

The reason for these fronting arrangements is that, just as some counterparties may prefer fully-collateralized reinsurance, other counterparties may prefer to enter into reinsurance contracts with a rated reinsurer. Alternatively, there may be situations in which the structure of the reinsurance contract would otherwise render direct collateralization uneconomic (for example, if the contract provided for reinstatable limits, which are described below). By entering into a fronting arrangement, Blue Capital Re is able to participate in reinsurance opportunities that would not otherwise be available to us, although Blue Capital Re is still required to provide collateral to the fronting reinsurer.

Under typical fronting agreements, all of the reinsurance risks are retroceded to the reinsurer who, in turn, provides the fronting reinsurer with collateral in an amount equal to or greater than the contractual limit less the premium receivable plus any origination fees owed. A fronting fee, which is a percentage of net premiums written, is deducted from premiums paid to the reinsurer.
Other fronting agreements may include subsequent (or reinstated) contractual limits of coverage following a covered loss event in return for an additional premium. Under these agreements, Blue Capital Re is required to fully collateralize both the original limit and the reinstated limits. Reinstatement generally occurs under two circumstances: (i) automatically and with no additional premium other than the original premium; or (ii) automatically with an additional premium that is agreed upon when the policy is written. 
Blue Capital Re may enter into some arrangements whereby the reinstatement premium paid is apportioned on a pre-agreed basis between Blue Capital Re and the fronting reinsurer. This arrangement gives Blue Capital Re access to the reinstatement reinsurance market, a market in which rated reinsurers often participate but one in which unrated reinsurers, such as Blue Capital Re, would otherwise have limited access to.

Blue Water Re Retrocessional Agreements

Blue Capital Re also provides facultative retrocessional reinsurance to Blue Water Re pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement. The terms of this agreement mirror those of the original insurance policies. See "Conflicts of Interest" for information about the affiliation between Sompo International and us.

Blue Water Re is Sompo International’s market-facing collateralized reinsurer, and it focuses on providing reinsurance protection to primary insurance companies globally. Blue Water Re underwrites and enters into collateralized reinsurance contracts with Sompo International and other third-party insurance companies, which transfer all or a portion of the risks and the premiums under these third-party insurance companies’ contracts to Blue Water Re. All or a portion of these risks and premiums are then allocated to Blue Capital Re by way of the BW Retrocessional Agreement. Under this agreement, Blue Capital Re accepts risks from Blue Water Re in exchange for the corresponding premiums relating to the accepted risks.

Industry Loss Warranties

Blue Capital Re or Blue Capital Re ILS may buy and sell industry loss warranties as a way to access certain risks. An industry loss warranty is a financial instrument designed to protect insurers or reinsurers from severe losses due to natural and man-made catastrophes and can take the form of either an insurance contract or a swap agreement. Under both forms, a premium is paid at the inception of the contract and, in return, a payout is made if a catastrophic event causes loss to the insurance industry in excess of a predetermined trigger amount. Industry loss warranties may also be triggered by other parametric measurements defined in the contract such as observed wind speeds, measured seismic activity or other factors. Industry loss warranties in the form of an insurance contract (also referred to as the "indemnity form") are typically dual-trigger instruments and, in addition to requiring a loss to the industry, require that the buyer of the protection actually suffer a loss from the triggering event. Blue Capital Re may buy and sell industry loss warranties in the form of an insurance contract, and Blue Capital Re ILS may buy and sell industry loss warranties in the form of a derivative contract.
Catastrophe Bonds

Blue Capital Re ILS may purchase catastrophe bonds to access certain risks. A catastrophe bond provides reinsurance protection in the event of a catastrophic event. The issuer pays the bondholder interest and repays the principal at maturity, but if a specified trigger condition, such as indemnity, industry or parametric index or modeled loss, are met, then the issuer is no longer required to pay interest or repay some or all of the principal. Blue Capital Re ILS may choose to buy, sell or, given sufficient scale to do so, issue catastrophe bonds.

Other

While our current focus is to provide reinsurance against natural property catastrophe risks, our strategy may evolve to the extent that man-made or other risks (e.g., terrorism reinsurance, workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance, casualty reinsurance) offer more attractive expected risk-adjusted returns or diversification benefits. Blue Capital Re ILS’ portfolio may include over-the-counter or exchange-traded futures or options listed on catastrophe indexes, such as catastrophe or weather derivatives.
Financing, Hedging and Other Investment Activities

We may incur debt, through our existing unsecured credit facility (the "2016 Credit Facility") or otherwise, in order to, among other things: provide working capital; write new business; enter into other reinsurance opportunities; manage our capital requirements; respond to, or comply with, changes in capital requirements, if any, that the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the "BMA") or other regulatory bodies use to evaluate us; acquire new businesses; or invest in existing businesses. In the event that we borrow for any of these purposes or other purposes, we intend to limit our aggregate borrowing to an amount no greater than 50% of our shareholders’ equity at the time of the borrowing. However, subject to the approval of the Board, we may borrow an amount in excess of 50% of our shareholders’ equity at the time of the borrowing.

We may, from time to time, for the purposes of portfolio optimization or to hedge certain risks in the portfolio, enter into retrocessional contracts, invest in insurance-linked securities, enter into derivative contracts or issue catastrophe bonds. All hedging contracts and investments that we enter into are governed by our underwriting guidelines and are approved by the Manager’s Investment and/or Underwriting Committee.

Our Underwriting Guidelines

The Manager has broad discretion to execute our underwriting strategy, subject to our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board.

Our underwriting guidelines apply in respect of any new underwriting decision at the time of such decision, using the information available to the Manager at that time. This includes information on the existing portfolio contract limits and modeled loss exposures by zone, as well as estimations of the potential impact on portfolio limits and modeled loss exposures from unquantified external factors. These factors include industry loss events that have the potential to cause loss to our portfolio and changes in methodology for calculating modeled losses. Based on the information available to the Manager at the time, if a new opportunity being considered would cause a restriction to be breached, or if a restriction relevant to that new opportunity is already in breach, then that new opportunity will not be allocated to us. The existence of restriction breaches does not preclude us from entering into any new opportunity; it only restricts us from entering into new opportunities that would result in a new breach or exacerbate existing breaches of restrictions.

Our underwriting guidelines are summarized below, but the Board may change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy at any time without a vote or approval of our shareholders.

Class of Reinsurance

Our underwriting guidelines establish maximum and minimum thresholds for the amount of each class of reinsurance, as follows (each expressed as a percentage of our shareholders’ equity):

• | 0% to 100% in indemnity reinsurance;


• | 0% to 50% in indemnity retrocession;


• | 0% to 100% in quota share retrocessional agreements;


• | 0% to 50% in industry loss warranties;


• | 0% to 20% in catastrophe bonds; and


• | 0% to 20% in other non-property catastrophe risks.


9

We typically deploy at least 50% of our portfolio in indemnity reinsurance, indemnity retrocession and quota share retrocessional agreements. Taking into account our underwriting guidelines and the targeted allocation described above, we expect that the majority of our portfolio will be allocated to traditional indemnity reinsurance (including quota share retrocessional agreements).
Geographic Diversity

We pursue a geographically diversified reinsurance strategy with an emphasis on the 14 individual zones set out below. We seek to maintain a projected net exposure from any one catastrophe loss event in any individual zone at or below 50% of our shareholders’ equity.

North America | Europe | Rest of World 
· U.S. Northeast· U.S. Southeast· U.S. Florida· U.S. Gulf· U.S. New Madrid· U.S. Midwest· U.S. California· U.S. Hawaii· Canada | · Europe | · Australia· New Zealand· Japan· South America 


Examples of individual zones include: U.S. Florida Windstorm (1st event), U.S. Florida Windstorm (2nd event), European Windstorm (1st event), European Windstorm (2nd event), U.S. California Earthquake (1st event), Japan Earthquake (1st event) and U.S. Midwest Aggregate. The Company to the best of its knowledge has not made and does not have current plans to have any contacts with any governments or entities targeted by U.S. sanctions including those applicable to Sudan, Syria and Iran.

Other Limitations

We seek to maintain a projected net impact from any one catastrophe loss event at the 1 in 100 year return period for any one zone at or below 35% of our shareholders’ equity. A 100 year return period can also be referred to as the 1.0% occurrence exceedance probability, meaning there is an estimated 1.0% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded. We seek to maintain a projected net impact from any one earthquake loss event at the 1 in 250 year return period for any zone at or below 35% of our shareholders’ equity. A 250 year return period can also be referred to as the 0.4% occurrence exceedance probability, meaning there is an estimated 0.4% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded. For these risks, the projected net impact will be determined by the Manager using various systems, including Sompo International’s proprietary systems and data.

We may also: (i) purchase retrocessional or industry loss warranty protection to mitigate the impact of large catastrophe events on our portfolio or to optimize the expected return of our portfolio; and (ii) enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to non-U.S. dollar currencies.

Our Reinsurance Risk Selection and Underwriting Process

We employ a granular approach to risk selection and portfolio construction. We target reinsurance counterparties through which we can access the full spectrum of information associated with each reinsurance loss exposure. In a majority of the reinsurance transactions that we enter into, we are a "quoting reinsurer," meaning that we provide an initial quote to the broker rather than responding to quotes provided by the broker. By contrast, we believe some other reinsurance providers act as price followers and only access exposure at an industry loss level and, accordingly, cannot evaluate specific information related to individual elements of underlying risk or control the underwriting process. We believe this holistic approach enables us to build and maintain a portfolio of reinsurance contracts with attractive risk-adjusted returns.

10

The Manager, on our behalf and subject to the oversight of the Board, employs selective underwriting criteria in the contracts it chooses to underwrite and spends a significant amount of time with our cedants and brokers to understand the risks and appropriately structure the contracts. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, the Manager assesses, among other factors:


• | the client’s and industry historical loss data and current market conditions;


• | the business purpose served by a proposed contract;


• | the client’s pricing and underwriting strategies;


• | the client’s claims management and mitigation practices;


• | the expected duration for claims to fully develop;


• | the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share;


• | the reputation and financial strength of the client;


• | the reputation and expertise of the broker;


• | proposed contract terms and conditions; and


• | reports provided by third party industry specialists.

Our Structure

We conduct our business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Blue Capital Re and Blue Capital Re ILS.

We conduct our reinsurance business through Blue Capital Re. As a result of the approvals received from the BMA and the terms of our approved business plan, Blue Capital Re may only enter into reinsurance contracts that are fully-collateralized at 100% of the aggregate limit at the inception of each reinsurance contract. Blue Capital Re is therefore subject to less stringent regulatory oversight than Class 4 insurers and has more modest capital and surplus requirements. Blue Capital Re is not a rated entity, and we do not intend to obtain financial strength ratings for Blue Capital Re from any rating agency. In the future, we may choose not to write reinsurance solely on a fully-collateralized basis, in which case we may obtain financial strength ratings for Blue Capital Re and will make the relevant applications to the BMA either to: (i) change our business plan; (ii) register Blue Capital Re as another class of reinsurer (if necessary); or (iii) remove any waivers that have been granted on the basis of writing fully-collateralized reinsurance contacts.

We conduct certain hedging and other investment activities through Blue Capital Re ILS, including investing in insurance-linked securities.
The Manager

We rely on the Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sompo International, for services that are essential to the operation of our business. The Manager manages our assets and makes all of our underwriting and investment decisions, subject to our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board.

The Manager also manages other accounts with areas of focus that overlap with our strategy, and expects to continue to do so in the future. The Manager is not restricted in any way from sponsoring or accepting business or capital from new clients, insurance or reinsurance companies, funds or other accounts, including businesses that are similar to, or that overlap with, our business. Therefore, the Manager’s time and attention may be divided between us and other businesses.
Investment Management Agreement

The Company has entered into an investment management agreement with the Manager (the "Investment Management Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Manager has full discretionary authority, including the delegation of the provision of its services, to manage our assets, subject to our underwriting guidelines, the terms of the Investment Management Agreement and the oversight of the Board.
11


Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement

The Company, Blue Capital Re and the Manager have entered into an underwriting and insurance management agreement (the "Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement"). Pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, the Manager provides underwriting, risk management, claims management, ceded retrocession agreements management and actuarial and reinsurance accounting services to Blue Capital Re. The Manager has full discretionary authority to manage the underwriting decisions of Blue Capital Re, subject to our underwriting guidelines, the terms of the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement and the oversight of the Board and of the board of directors of Blue Capital Re.
Administrative Services Agreement

The Company has entered into an administrative services agreement (the "Administrative Services Agreement") with the Manager. Pursuant to the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement, the Manager provides us with support services, including the services of our CFO, as well as finance and accounting, internal audit, claims management, policy wording, modeling software licenses, office space, information technology, human resources and administrative support. The Manager has the right to sub-contract the provision of these services (other than the services of our CFO) to a third-party.

Neither our CEO nor CFO receives any compensation directly from us for their services. Rather, the services provided by our CEO are deemed to be encompassed within the management fee we are charged by the Manager under the Investment Management Agreement and the services provided by our CFO are directly charged to us by the Manager under the Administrative Services Agreement.

The following table summarizes the fees payable to the Manager pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement and certain other terms of these agreements:
Summary Description

Management Fee | The Manager is entitled to a management fee (the "Management Fee") of 1.5% of our average total shareholders’ equity per annum, calculated and payable in arrears in cash each quarter (or part thereof) that the Investment Management Agreement is in effect. For purposes of calculating the Management Fee, our total shareholders’ equity means: (1) the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the quarter of any such issuance), plus (2) our retained earnings as of the end of the most recently completed quarter (without taking into account any non-cash compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), minus (3) any amount that we may have paid to repurchase our Common Shares on a cumulative basis since inception. It also excludes (x) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted shareholders’ equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items relating to insurance-linked securities, and (y) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP after discussions between the Manager and our independent directors and approval by both a majority of our independent directors and the Manager for all such adjustments. As a result, our shareholders’ equity, for purposes of calculating the Management Fee, could be greater or less than the amount of shareholders’ equity shown on our financial statements.

12


Performance Fee | The Manager is entitled to a performance fee (the "Performance Fee") calculated and payable in arrears in cash each quarter (or part thereof) that the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement is in effect in an amount, not less than zero, equal to the product of (1) 20% and (2) the difference between (A) our pre-tax, pre-Performance Fee Distributable Income for the then current quarter and (B) a hurdle amount calculated as the product of (i) the weighted average of the issue price per Common Share pursuant to each of our public or private offerings of Common Shares since our inception multiplied by the weighted average number of all Common Shares outstanding (including any restricted share units, any restricted Common Shares and other Common Shares underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans), as further reduced by the amount, if any, by which our inception-to-date dividends to shareholders exceeds our inception-to-date GAAP net income, and (ii) 2% (equivalent to an 8% annualized hurdle rate); provided, however, that the foregoing Performance Fee is subject to a rolling three-year high water mark.
Term | We generally may not terminate the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement or the Administrative Services Agreement until November 5, 2021, whether or not the Manager’s performance results are satisfactory. Each of these agreements renews automatically on November 5, 2021, and every three years thereafter, unless terminated in accordance with its terms. During the term of these agreements, we may not enter into any other investment management, underwriting and insurance management or services agreement. 
Termination Fee | Upon any termination or non-renewal of either of the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement (other than for a material breach by, or the insolvency of, the Manager), we will pay a one-time termination fee to the Manager equal to 5% of our GAAP shareholders’ equity, calculated as of the most recently completed quarter prior to the date of termination. 
Expense Reimbursement | Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement and the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, we reimburse the Manager for various fees, expenses and other costs in connection with the services provided under the terms of these agreements. The only fees payable under the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement are to reimburse the Manager for various fees, expenses and other costs in connection with the services provided under the terms of that agreement, including the services of our CFO, modeling software licenses and finance, legal and administrative support. 

Capital Management Policy

The Company has in the past and intends to continue to distribute a minimum of 90% of its annual Distributable Income to shareholders and to make such distributions through regular quarterly dividend payments for each of the first three quarters of each year, and either repurchase Common Shares or pay a special dividend after the end of the year should funds be available. Although the Company’s year-end net income (if any) will vary from year-to-year, the Company expects that in most years the sum of its regular quarterly dividend payments will be less than 90% of its annual Distributable Income. If this is the case, the Company intends to commence a Common Share repurchase program or declare a special dividend in the following year to distribute an amount that, taken together with the prior year’s regular quarterly dividends, will be at least 90% of its Distributable Income for the prior calendar year. The declaration and payment of a special dividend or commencement of a Common Share repurchase program, if any, may not occur until a significant period of time after the completion of the Company’s calendar year. The commencement of a Common Share repurchase program for a portion of Distributable Income may be elected by the Board thereby reducing or eliminating a special dividend. See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" contained in Item 7 herein.

The declaration of regular quarterly and special dividends, if any, and, if declared, the amount of any such dividend, as well as the amount of any Common Share repurchases, will be subject to the discretion of the Board and to the consideration of various additional risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any future determination to pay dividends or repurchase Common Shares will remain at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon many factors, including: (i) the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including its ability to generate cash flow in excess of its expenses) and capital requirements; (ii) general business conditions; (iii) legal, tax and regulatory limitations; (iv) contractual prohibitions and other restrictions; (v) current trading price of Common Shares as compared with the fully converted book value per Common Share; and (vi) any other factors that the Board deems relevant. The Company generally expects that its dividends will be subject to customary dividend tax treatment in the U.S., but if its total dividends paid during any given year exceed its current and accumulated earnings and profits as of the end of such year (determined under U.S. tax principles), a portion of its dividends paid in that year will be treated: (i) first, as a nontaxable 
13

return of capital, to the extent of a shareholder’s tax basis in Common Shares (on a dollar-for-dollar basis); and (ii) subsequently, as capital gain.

The Company has no substantial operations of its own and relies primarily on cash dividends or distributions from its subsidiaries to pay its operating expenses, amounts owed under the 2016 Credit Facility and dividends to its shareholders. Furthermore, Blue Capital Re, the Company’s wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, is regulated as a Class 3A insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA, and its ability to pay dividends to the Company is limited under Bermuda law and regulations. See "Regulation and Capital Requirements" for more information.

In addition, under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended (the "Companies Act"), none of the Company, Blue Capital Re or Blue Capital Re ILS is permitted to declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities. See "Regulation and Capital Requirements" for more information.

The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or repurchase Common Shares will depend upon its performance, which depends in turn upon the performance of its subsidiaries. We expect that dividends will be paid in cash to the extent that cash is available for distribution. However, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends to its shareholders or repurchase Common Shares. In addition, the Board may change the Company’s capital management policy in the future.

Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company expects to make distributions by way of dividends from its retained earnings or from its contributed surplus or otherwise in accordance with the Companies Act and its bye-laws to the extent that the Board considers this to be appropriate.

The 2016 Credit Facility contains certain covenants that could prohibit or otherwise restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or repurchase Common Shares or its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends to their parent. We may enter into additional contracts or financing arrangements that prohibit or otherwise restrict the Company’s ability or the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future or the Company's ability to repurchase Common Shares.

GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we wrote $33.2 million and $46.1 million of gross reinsurance premiums, respectively. 
Gross Premiums Written By Broker
We market our reinsurance policies worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. The majority of our gross premiums written are sourced by the Manager through a limited number of brokers. The broker is not a party to the reinsurance contract.

We and the Manager seek to build long-term relationships with brokers by providing: (i) prompt and responsive service on underwriting submissions; (ii) innovative and customized reinsurance solutions to their clients; and (iii) timely payment of claims. Brokers receive compensation, typically in the form of a commission, based on negotiated percentages of the premium they produce and the performance of other necessary services. Brokerage costs constitute a significant portion of our reinsurance acquisition costs.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our gross reinsurance premiums written by broker for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:


 | Year Ended | | Year Ended 
($ in millions) | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
Aon Benfield | $ | 6.9 | | | 21 | % | | $ | 16.1 | | | 35 | %
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. | 11.6 | | | 35 | % | | 11.9 | | | 26 | %
Willis Towers Watson | 8.7 | | | 26 | % | | 10.8 | | | 23 | %
All other brokers | 6.0 | | | 18 | % | | 6.0 | | | 13 | %

Total gross premiums written | $ | 33.2 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 46.1 | | | 100 | %


During 2018, the majority of our reinsurance premiums written included in the table above were derived from a quota share retrocessional reinsurance agreement with Sompo International pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement. As illustrated, the majority of our reinsurance premiums written are sourced through a limited number of brokers, with Aon Benfield, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Towers Watson providing a total of 82% of our gross reinsurance premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2018. We are therefore highly dependent on these brokers and a loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers either to Sompo International or directly to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A herein.

Gross Premiums Written By Geographic Area of Risks Insured

We seek to diversify our exposure across geographic zones around the world in order to obtain a prudent spread of risk. The spread of these exposures is also a function of market conditions and opportunities.
The following table sets forth a breakdown of gross reinsurance premiums written by geographic area of risks insured for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT
Claims are managed by the Manager pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement. The Manager has access to Sompo International’s experienced, technical claims teams working closely with each of our operating subsidiaries. The Manager reviews and responds to initial loss reports, administers claims databases, identifies and handles coverage issues, determines whether further investigation is required and where appropriate, retains outside claims counsel, establishes case reserves and approves claims for payment. In addition, the 
15

Manager may conduct audits of our significant clients throughout the year, evaluating claims handling abilities, reserve philosophies, loss notification processes and the overall quality of our clients' performance.
Upon receipt, claims notices are recorded by the Manager within our underwriting, financial and claims systems. When we are notified of insured losses or discover potential losses as part of our claims audits, the Manager records a case reserve as appropriate for the estimated amount of the exposure at that time. The estimate reflects the judgment of the Manager based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of the Manager regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of outside counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process.
RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES
We are required by applicable laws and regulations and GAAP to establish reserves for losses and LAE that arise from our business. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and LAE for insured or reinsured claims that have been incurred at or before the balance sheet date, whether already known to us or not yet reported. It is our policy to establish these losses and LAE reserves after evaluating all information known to us as of the valuation date. Actuarial services are provided to us by the Manager pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement.
The Manager uses statistical and actuarial methods to make a reasonable estimate of ultimate expected losses and LAE. The period of time from the reporting of a loss to us and the settlement of our liability may be several years. During this period, additional facts and trends may be revealed. As these factors become apparent, estimated reserves will be adjusted, sometimes requiring an increase or decrease in our overall reserves, and at other times requiring a reallocation of incurred but not reported reserves to specific case reserves.
Reserves for losses and LAE are based in part upon the estimation of losses resulting from catastrophic events. Estimation of losses from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the infrequency and severity of large catastrophes. Therefore, we utilize commercially available models, historical reinsurance industry property catastrophe claims experience and other data and estimates provided by our clients to supplement our own historical claims experience for purposes of evaluating future trends and providing an estimate of ultimate claims costs on large catastrophes.
To assist us in establishing appropriate reserves for losses and LAE, we analyze a significant amount of insurance industry information with respect to the pricing environment, loss trends, and loss settlement patterns. In combination with our individual pricing analyses, this industry information is used to guide our loss and LAE estimates. These estimates are reviewed regularly, and adjustments, if any, are recorded in earnings in the periods in which they are determined. While management believes it has made a reasonable estimate of ultimate losses, there can be no assurance that our future losses and LAE will not exceed our current total reserves. For a description of the Company's current reserves, please refer to Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loss and LAE Reserves" and Note 2, "Loss and LAE Reserve Movements" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

There may be conflicts of interest that arise out of our relationship with Sompo International and the Manager. Our Chairman and CEO and our CFO are also employees of Sompo International and the Manager is wholly-owned by Sompo International. As a result, our officers, two of our directors and the Manager may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, Sompo International or other parties.

As part of our business model and strategy, we rely on affiliates of Sompo International for access to certain segments of the reinsurance market. In particular, pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement, we may participate in: (i) retrocessional, quota share or other agreements in which Sompo International or its affiliates have an interest; and (ii) fronting arrangements with Sompo International. Although these transactions may present conflicts of interest, we nonetheless continue to pursue and consummate these transactions.
Our business overlaps with portions of Sompo International’s business. The Manager, in addition to managing some of Sompo International’s accounts, manages other accounts that may compete with us, including other accounts affiliated with Sompo International. The Manager makes available to us opportunities to enter into reinsurance contracts and insurance-linked securities and makes investments that it determines are appropriate for us in accordance with its allocation policies and our underwriting guidelines. The Manager is not required to allocate any or all such opportunities to us. We expect that the 
16

Manager will primarily allocate any overlapping opportunities on a proportional basis among the various accounts that they manage.
Service Agreements with Sompo International

We rely on the Manager for services that are essential to the operation of our business. The Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sompo International. As of December 31, 2018 Sompo International owned 33.2% of our outstanding Common Shares and had two representatives on our Board which consists of five directors.

The Manager manages our assets and makes all of our underwriting and investment decisions, subject to our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board.

The Manager is not restricted in any way from sponsoring or accepting business or capital from new clients, insurance companies, funds or other accounts, including businesses that are similar to, or that overlap with, our business. Therefore, the Manager’s time and attention may be divided between us and other businesses.

See "The Manager" for detailed information concerning each of our service agreements with Sompo International.

COMPETITION

We compete with a variety of operators, including: (i) major global reinsurance companies, many of which have extensive experience in reinsurance and have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do; (ii) other Bermuda-based reinsurers that write reinsurance and that target the same markets and utilize similar business strategies as we do, many of which have more capital than we do; and (iii) capital markets participants such as investment banks and investment funds that access business in securitized form, including through the issuance of insurance-linked securities, or through special purpose vehicles, derivative transactions or other instruments.

Competition in the insurance and reinsurance industry has increased over the past several years and may increase further, either as a result of capital provided by new entrants or of the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers. In addition, alternative products, such as the collateralized reinsurance contracts that we and others write and the insurance-linked securities that we and others may invest in, may also provide increased market capacity. Continued increases in the supply of property reinsurance may have adverse consequences for us and for the property catastrophe industry generally, including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention and less favorable policy terms and conditions.
We consider our primary competitors to include: Aeolus Capital Management, Markel CatCo Investment Management, Credit Suisse Asset Management, Leadenhall Capital, Lloyd’s of London, Nephila Capital Ltd., Pillar Capital, RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., Validus Reinsurance, Ltd., Everest Re Group Ltd., Hiscox Ltd. and any property catastrophe reinsurance sidecars or other similar vehicles managed or sponsored by them.  
REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
General
The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers. Blue Capital Re is regulated by the BMA.
Bermuda Regulation

The Insurance Act provides that no person may carry on an insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA. In deciding whether to grant registration, the BMA has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to the insurer complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose at any time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.

17

The BMA has enacted various legislative and regulatory amendments to the Insurance Act to aid in Bermuda’s achievement of regulatory equivalence with that of the European Commission's Solvency II framework in relation to commercial insurance entities. Bermuda was awarded full equivalence for commercial insurers under Europe's Solvency II regime applicable to insurance companies, which regime came into effect on January 1, 2016. The Insurance Act now : (i) requires certain classes of insurers (including the Company) to maintain their head offices in Bermuda; (ii) requires insurers to notify the BMA, in addition to any increase, of any reduction or disposal of shares taking a shareholder controller below 10%, 20%, 33% or 50%; (iii) permits certain classes of insurers to submit condensed audited GAAP financial statements; and (iv) establishes the minimum criteria of matters of material significance whereby the approved auditor is required to provide written notice to the BMA of those matters that would impact the BMA’s discharge of its functions under the Insurance Act. The Insurance Returns and Solvency Regulations 1980 also now include the items and the content of the documents to be submitted as part of the required statutory financial returns for insurers carrying on special purpose business. The Insurance Act requires insurers and insurance groups to meet regulatory capital and reporting requirements on a statutory economic capital and surplus basis. All insurers are also required to implement corporate governance policies and processes as the BMA considers appropriate given the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of the insurer and all insurers, on an annual basis, are now required to deliver a declaration to the BMA confirming whether or not they meet the minimum criteria for registration. All Class 4, Class 3B and Class 3A insurers are required to produce and publish a Financial Condition Report on their website, or provide a copy to the public on request if they do not have a website, as part of its annual Bermuda Capital and Solvency Requirement. The Financial Condition Report provides particulars on the business performance, governance structure, risk profile, solvency valuation, and capital management of the insurer.
In January 2019, the BMA implemented a requirement for an alternative capital schedule to be filed for December 31, 2017 year-end filings and onwards. The Company will be required to complete and file with the BMA this schedule with respect to any of its alternative capital structures. The BMA has confirmed that alternative capital is where insurers conduct business that is financed by a mechanism other than shareholders’ capital of the (re)insurance company. This may take various forms such as catastrophe (cat) bonds, industry loss warranties, sidecars, collateralized reinsurers, longevity and mortality bond/swaps, hybrid securities such as preference shares, swaps, and contingent capital such as letters of credit, among others. The filings are confidential, but the BMA may produce valuable aggregate statistics for publication from the information provided in the filings.
The Bermuda Insurance Code of Conduct (the "Bermuda Insurance Code"), which is a codification of best practices for insurers provided by the BMA, was also amended in 2015 and all insurers had to be in compliance by December 31, 2015. Substantive revisions to the Bermuda Insurance Code included a new requirement for the board of an insurer to ensure that its insurance manager is both fit and able to carry out its duties to ensure that the insurer operates in a prudent manner and a clarification that only limited purpose insurers will be allowed to outsource the CEO and senior executive roles to an insurance manager.
Insurance Manager Code of Conduct
In 2016, the BMA implemented the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct, which establishes duties, requirements and compliance standards to be adhered to by all insurance managers registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act, including the procedure and sound principles to be observed by insurance managers. Insurance managers were required to implement the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct into their operations by December 31, 2016. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct will be taken into account by the BMA in assessing whether the insurance manager has satisfied its requirement under the minimum criteria for registration to conduct its business in a prudent manner. 
However, the BMA takes a proportionate approach to compliance, taking into consideration the nature, scale and complexity of an insurance managers’ business. The Manager is subject to the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct and is required to file annually prior to June 30 an annual return including management financial statements for the previous financial year and a business plan for the upcoming financial year, and a statutory declaration confirming its compliance with the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct. 
 The BMA utilizes a risk-based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance and reinsurance companies. As part of the BMA’s risk-based system, an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer or reinsurer is used to determine the limitations and specific requirements that may be imposed. Thereafter the BMA keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis, including through the scrutiny of audited financial statements, and, as appropriate, meeting with senior management during onsite visits.
18

Regulation of Brokers and Agents
In addition to being registered as an insurance manager under the Insurance Act, the Manager is registered as an agent under the Insurance Act. Insurance brokers and insurance agents have historically been lightly regulated in Bermuda. However, in line with international standards in this space, the BMA has implemented more rigorous regulation. The Insurance Act has been amended to extend certain provisions to regulated insurance brokers and agents. These changes are effective of as December 31, 2018 and include that: (i) the BMA may make rules prescribing prudential standards in relation to insurance brokers and agents (which will include an annual report) and apply penalties for failure to file statutory returns; (ii) brokers and agents are required to maintain lists of insurers for which they act, (iii) brokers and agents are required to notify the BMA within 14 days of any change of shareholder controller or officer; and (iv) brokers and agents are required to have sufficient indemnity insurance cover. The BMA has provided a template annual reporting form and a draft Code of Conduct for insurance brokers and agents which establishes the duties, requirements and standards to be complied with by all insurance brokers and agents registered under Section 10 of the Insurance Act, including the procedures and sound principles to be observed by such persons. 
The BMA has also indicated that insurance brokers and agents will annually be required to file: (i) a return accompanied by a copy of the insurance broker or agent’s management accounts for the financial year and business plan for the next financial year; and (ii) a declaration signed by two directors (one of whom may be the chief executive officer) of the insurance broker or agent confirming that to the best of their knowledge and belief the information in the annual return is fair and accurate. Insurance brokers and agents, including the Manager, will be expected to comply with the Code of Conduct by June 30, 2019.
Regulatory Framework

The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards on Bermuda insurance companies, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below.

Classification of Insurers. The Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers (which term includes reinsurers) carrying on long-term business, general business (being everything except life, annuity and certain types of accident and health insurance) and special purpose business. There are six main general business classifications for insurers ranging from Class 1 (pure captives) to Class 4 (very large commercial underwriters), with Class 4 insurers being subject to the strictest regulation. There is only one classification of special purpose insurer, although special purpose insurers have been categorized effective as of December 31, 2018 into unrestricted special business insurers and restricted special purpose insurers. Insurers carrying on “restricted special purpose” business may only conduct special purpose business with specific insureds approved by the BMA. Insurers carrying on “unrestricted special purpose” can conduct special purpose business with any insureds. The Insurance Act also provides for other additional categories of insurers with limited licenses to encourage innovation in the insurance industry. These include Class IGB insurers, meaning insurers carrying on general business in an innovative or experimental manner, and Class ILT insurers, meaning insurers carrying on long-term business in an innovative or experimental manner.

An entity such as Blue Capital Re is registrable as a Class 3A insurer when: (i) it intends to carry on general insurance business in circumstances where (a) 50% or more of the net premiums written or (b) 50% or more of the loss and loss expense provisions, represent unrelated business; and (ii) its total net premiums written from unrelated business are less than $50.0 million. Class 3A insurers are required to maintain fully paid-up share capital of $120,000.

The total annual net premiums from unrelated business written by Blue Capital Re may, in the future, exceed $50.0 million, the maximum amount of total net premiums currently permitted by a Class 3A insurer. However, Blue Capital Re has obtained a waiver from the BMA so that it may remain a Class 3A insurer at all times, even if it writes more than $50.0 million in total annual net premiums from unrelated business.
Principal Representative, Head and Principal Office. Every registered insurer or reinsurer is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda, subject to certain prescribed requirements under the Insurance Act. Further, any registered insurer that is a Class 3A insurer or above is required to maintain a head office in Bermuda and direct and manage its insurance business from Bermuda. The 2015 amendments to the Insurance Act provided that in considering whether an insurer satisfies the requirements of having its head office in Bermuda, the BMA may consider (i) where the underwriting, risk management and operational decision making occurs; (ii) whether the presence of senior executives who are responsible for, and involved in, the decision making are located in Bermuda; and (iii) where meetings of the board of directors occur. The BMA will also consider (i) the location where management meets to effect policy decisions; (ii) the residence of the officers, insurance managers or employees; and (iii) the residence of one or more directors in Bermuda. Additionally, the BMA may look to the location of the insurance manager for determining whether a head office is in Bermuda. 

19

For the purpose of the Insurance Act, Blue Capital Re's principal office is the Company's executive offices at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda. The Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sompo International has been appointed and approved as the principal representative for Blue Capital Re. The principal representative has statutory reporting duties under the Bermuda Insurance Act for certain reportable events, such as threatened insolvency or non-compliance with the Insurance Act or with a condition or restriction imposed on an insurer.
Where there has been a significant loss that is reasonably likely to cause a Class 3A insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (as described in more detail below), the principal representative must furnish the BMA with a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-loss data. The principal representative must provide this within forty-five days of notifying the BMA of the loss.
In addition, where a notification has been made to the BMA regarding a material change to an insurer's business or structure (as described in more detail below), the principal representative has thirty days from the date of such notification to provide to the BMA unaudited interim statutory financial statements in relation to such period if so requested by the BMA, together with a general business solvency certificate in respect of those statements.
Loss Reserve Specialist. Generally, a Class 3A insurer is required to submit annually an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its financial statements and return in respect of its loss and LAE provisions. However, an insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to waive the aforementioned requirements. In this instance, Blue Capital Re has obtained such a waiver from the BMA.

Cancellation of Insurer’s Registration. The BMA may revoke or suspend Blue Capital Re’s license in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) false, misleading or inaccurate information has been supplied to the BMA by Blue Capital Re or on its behalf; (ii) we have ceased to carry on business; (iii) Blue Capital Re has persistently failed to pay fees due under the Insurance Act; (iv) Blue Capital Re has failed to comply with a condition attached to its registration or with an applicable requirement under the Insurance Act; (v) we are convicted of an offense against a provision of the Insurance Act; (vi) Blue Capital Re has, in the opinion of the BMA, not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles; or (vii) any of the minimum criteria for registration under the Insurance Act is not or will not have been fulfilled. If the BMA were to suspend or revoke Blue Capital Re’s license, we could lose our exemption under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act").

Annual Statutory Financial Statements and Return; Independent Approved Auditor. The Insurance Act generally requires all insurers to: (i) prepare annual statutory financial statements and returns; (ii) submit a declaration certifying compliance with the minimum criteria applicable to it including the minimum margin of solvency, enhanced capital requirements and any restrictions or conditions imposed on its license; and (iii) appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on such financial statements and returns. 
The independent auditor of the insurer must be approved by the BMA and may be the same person or firm that audits the insurer’s financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders. If the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor, the BMA may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor. The approved auditor is required to issue written notice to the BMA of matters of material significance for the discharge of the BMA’s functions as established under the Insurance Act.

An insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to have the requirement to file audited statutory financial statements annually with the BMA waived. In this instance, Blue Capital Re has obtained such a waiver from the BMA. However, Blue Capital Re is required to prepare and file annual condensed consolidated audited GAAP financial statements with the BMA.

Blue Capital Re’s independent auditor has been approved by the BMA.

Minimum Liquidity Ratio. The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio and requires Blue Capital Re to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include, but are not limited to, cash and cash equivalents, investments, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable and funds held by ceding companies. Relevant liabilities include, but are not limited to, loss and LAE reserves, other liabilities, letters of credit and guarantees.

Minimum Solvency Margin. The Insurance Act provides that the value of the assets of an insurer must exceed the value of its liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin.

20

The minimum solvency margin that must be maintained by a Class 3A insurer is the greatest of: (i) $1.0 million; (ii) 20% of net premiums written where such net premiums do not exceed $6.0 million and $1.2 million plus 15% of net premiums written where such net premiums exceed $6.0 million; (iii) 15% of net undiscounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves; and (iv) 25% of that insurer’s enhanced capital requirement ("ECR").

An insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to waive the aforementioned requirements. In this instance, Blue Capital Re has obtained such a waiver from the BMA so that its minimum solvency margin shall remain at $1.0 million at all times, provided that: (i) Blue Capital Re only enters into contracts of reinsurance that are fully-collateralized; and (ii) each transaction represents no material deviation from the original business plan filed with BMA at the time of Blue Capital Re’s registration.

ECR and Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirements ("BSCR"). Class 3A insurers are required to maintain available capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of the applicable ECR, which is established by reference to either the BSCR - Small and Medium-Sized Entities model or an approved internal capital model. Furthermore, to enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the insurer’s capital resources, a Class 3A insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with its 3-tiered capital system.
An insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to have the aforementioned ECR requirements waived. In this instance, Blue Capital Re has obtained such a waiver from the BMA and instead is required to submit a modified version of the BSCR model without an ECR.

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions. In addition to the requirements under the Companies Act (as discussed below), the Insurance Act limits the maximum amount of annual dividends and distributions that may be paid or distributed by Blue Capital Re without prior regulatory approval.

Blue Capital Re is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio, or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such breach. Additionally, annual distributions that would result in a reduction of Blue Capital Re’s prior year-end balance of statutory capital and surplus by more than 25% also requires the prior approval of the BMA.

If Blue Capital Re were to fail to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA.

The Companies Act also limits Blue Capital Re’s ability to pay dividends and make distributions to its shareholders. Blue Capital Re is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of its contributed surplus, if it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities.

Reduction of Capital.   Blue Capital Re may not reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year’s financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of Blue Capital Re’s paid in share capital, its contributed surplus (sometimes called additional paid in capital) and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital. 
Supervision, Investigation and Intervention. The BMA may appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of an insurer or a designated insurer (as detailed in "Group Supervision" below) if the BMA believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer’s or insurance group’s policyholders or potential policyholders. In order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to it, the BMA may direct an insurer or designated insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with the insurer’s or insurance group’s business. Further, the BMA has the power to appoint a professional person to prepare a report on any aspect of any matter about which the BMA has required or could require information.

If it appears to the BMA that: (i) there is a risk of the insurer or designated insurer becoming insolvent; (ii) there is significant risk that the insurer will be unable to meet its policyholder obligations; (iii) the insurer or designated insurer is in breach of the Insurance Act; (iv) any conditions imposed upon its registration, or the minimum criteria stipulated in the Insurance Act are not or have not been fulfilled in respect of a registered insurer; (v) a person has become a Controller (which for this purpose means a managing director, chief executive or other person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the insurer are accustomed to act, including any person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at any general meeting, or is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting shares or voting power or is otherwise able to 
21

exercise a significant influence over the management of the insurer) without providing the BMA with the appropriate notice or in contravention of a notice of objection; (vi) the registered insurer is in breach of its enhanced capital requirement; or (vii) a designated insurer is in breach of any provision of the Insurance Act or the regulations or rules applicable to it, the BMA may issue such directions as appear desirable for safeguarding the interests of policyholders or potential policyholders of the insurer or the insurance group. The BMA may also direct the insurer or designated insurer: (i) not to effect further contracts of insurance business; (ii) not to vary any insurance contract when the direction is given if the effect would be to increase the insurer’s liabilities; (iii) not to make any investments of a specified class; (iv) to realize any existing investments of a specified class; (v) to maintain in, or transfer to the custody of, a specified bank assets of the insurer that are specified in the direction; (vi) not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments; (vii) to limit its premium income; (viii) to remove a Controller or officer; or (ix) to file a petition for the winding-up of the insurer.

The BMA may also make rules prescribing prudential standards with which the insurer must comply. Blue Capital Re may make an application to be exempted from such rules.
Winding-up. The BMA may present a petition for the winding-up of an insurer on the grounds that: (i) the insurer is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of sections 161 and 162 of the Companies Act; (ii) the insurer has failed to satisfy an obligation to which it is or was subject by virtue of the Insurance Act; or (iii) the insurer has failed to satisfy the obligation imposed upon it by section 15 of the Insurance Act as to the preparation of accounts or to produce or file financial statements in accordance with section 17 of the Insurance Act, and that the BMA is unable to ascertain the insurer’s financial position. In addition, if it appears to the BMA that it is expedient in the public interest that an insurer should be wound up, it may present a petition for it to be so wound up if a court thinks it just and equitable for it to be so wound up.

Disclosure of Information. In addition to powers under the Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to it. The BMA has also been given powers to assist foreign regulatory authorities with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda, subject to certain restrictions. For example, the BMA must be satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities of the foreign regulatory authority. Further, the BMA must consider whether cooperation with the foreign regulatory authorities is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure by the BMA to a foreign regulatory authority without consent of the insurer are limited and the Insurance Act provides sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality.

Bermuda Insurance Code. The Bermuda Insurance Code contains the duties, requirements and compliance standards to be adhered to by all insurers. The Bermuda Insurance Code stipulates that insurers are to develop and apply policies and procedures capable of assessment by the BMA. The board of directors of Blue Capital Re has the responsibility to ensure that Blue Capital Re is compliant with the Bermuda Insurance Code and is required to file annually a statutory declaration confirming compliance with the Bermuda Insurance Code.
Insurance Manager Code of Conduct. The Insurance Manager Code of Conduct establishes duties, requirements and compliance standards to be adhered to by all insurance managers registered under the Bermuda Insurance Act, including the procedure and sound principles to be observed by insurance managers. The Manager is subject to the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct and is required to file annually prior to June 30 an annual return, and a statutory declaration confirming its compliance with the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct. 
Group Supervision. The BMA may, in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to act as its group supervisor. An "insurance group" is defined as a group of companies that conducts exclusively, or mainly, insurance business.

None of the Company, Blue Capital Re or Blue Capital Re ILS is currently subject to group supervision, but the BMA may exercise its authority to act as our group supervisor in the future if we were to form an overseas entity.

Notifications to the BMA

Notification of Material Changes. All registered insurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. For the purposes of the Insurance Act, the following changes are material: (i) the transfer or acquisition of insurance business that is part of a scheme falling under section 25 of the Insurance Act or section 99 of the Companies Act; (ii) the amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm; (iii) engaging in unrelated business that is retail business; (iv) the acquisition of a controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance business which offers services and products to persons who are not affiliates of the insurer; (v) outsourcing all or substantially all of our actuarial, risk management or internal audit functions; (vi) outsourcing all or a material part of an insurer’s 
22

underwriting activity; (vii) the transfer, other than by way of reinsurance, of all or substantially all of a line of business; (viii) the expansion into a material new line of business; (ix) the sale of an insurer; or (x) outsourcing of an officer role.

No registered insurer shall take any steps to give effect to a material change unless it has first served notice on the BMA that it intends to effect such material change and, before the end of 30 days, either the BMA has notified such company in writing that it has no objection to such change or the period has lapsed without the BMA having issued a notice of objection.

Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA’s intention to issue a formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination.
Change of Shareholder Controller, Controller or Officer

In the event that the share capital of an insurer (or its parent) is traded on any stock exchange recognized by the BMA, then any shareholder must notify the BMA within 45 days of becoming a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder of such insurer. Additionally, an insurer is also required to submit in writing to the BMA within 45 days, notification of a Shareholder Controller's (as defined in the Insurance Act) disposal or acquisition of shares whereby their proportion of voting rights held would reach or fall below 10%, 20%, 33% or 50%. An insurer or reinsurer must also provide written notice to the BMA that a person has become, or ceased to be, a Controller (as defined in the Insurance Act) of that insurer or reinsurer.
Blue Capital Re is also required to notify the BMA in writing in the event any person has become or has ceased to be a Controller or an officer of it, an officer being a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.
In addition, the Manager, as an insurance manager licensed under the Insurance Act, is required to give written notice to the BMA of the fact of any person having become or ceased to be a shareholder controller or officer of the Manager within 14 days of the insurance manager becoming aware of the relevant facts related to such change.

Failure to give any required notice is an offense under the Insurance Act.

Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations

Although the Company is incorporated in Bermuda, it is designated as non-resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to its non-resident status, the Company may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars, and there are no restrictions on the Company’s ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda.

Each of the Company, Blue Capital Re and Blue Capital Re ILS is incorporated in Bermuda as an "exempted company." Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As a result, they are exempt from Bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non-Bermudians, but they may not participate in certain business transactions, including: (i) the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda (except that required for their business and held by way of lease or tenancy for a term of not more than 50 years, or, with the consent of the Minister of Economic Development, that which is used to provide accommodations or recreational facilities for its officers and employees and is held by way of lease or tenancy for a term of not more than 21 years) without the express authorization of the Bermuda legislature; (ii) the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda to secure an amount in excess of $50,000 without the consent of the relevant Ministers; (iii) the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other than certain types of Bermuda government securities; or (iv) the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda, except in furtherance of their business carried on outside Bermuda or under license granted by the Minister of Economic Development.

Blue Capital Re is a licensed insurer in Bermuda, and so it may carry on activities from Bermuda that are related to and in support of its insurance business. Effective as of January 1, 2019, the Insurance Act was amended to prohibit the entry into non-insurance business by both commercial and non-commercial insurers. However, all insurers will continue to be able to engage in non-insurance business where such business is ancillary to the insurance business carried on by the insurer.

Exempted companies, such as the Company, Blue Capital Re and Blue Capital Re ILS, must comply with Bermuda resident representation provisions under the Companies Act. Securities may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003 and the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations of Bermuda which 
23

regulate the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, specific permission is required from the BMA, pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda companies, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA, in its policy dated June 1, 2005, provides that where any equity securities of a Bermuda company, which would include the Company’s Common Shares, are listed on an appointed stock exchange, general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of the company from and to a non-resident, for as long as any equity securities of the company remain so listed.

Notwithstanding the above general permission, the Company has applied for and received permission from the BMA to issue, grant, create, sell and transfer freely any of our Common Shares, stock, bonds, notes (other than promissory notes), debentures, debenture stock, units under a unit trust scheme, shares in an oil royalty, options, coupons, rights and depository receipts to and among persons who are either resident or non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes.
The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2016 became operative in Bermuda on March 28, 2016 and permits third parties, who are expressly identified in a contract but not specifically party to such contract, to be entitled to enforce and benefit from the terms of the contract, subject to certain requirements. The Bermuda legislation closely resembles the existing UK rights of third parties legislation.
The Bribery Act 2016 (the "Bribery Act") became operative on September 1, 2017. The Bribery Act is largely based on the UK's Bribery Act 2010, and aims to provide a modern and comprehensive scheme of bribery offenses in order to allow investigators, prosecutors and the courts to tackle bribery effectively, whether committed in Bermuda or overseas. The Bribery Act applies to any Bermuda individuals, or incorporated companies or other corporate entities (including partnerships) conducting business, whether in or outside of Bermuda, and any non-Bermuda incorporated companies, corporate entities (including partnerships) or individuals conducting business in Bermuda. The Company and its Bermuda subsidiaries have reviewed the Bribery Act and have in place a comprehensive Anti-Bribery Policy.
The Companies and Limited Liability Company (Beneficial Ownership) Amendment Act 2017, Exchange Control Amendment Act 2018 and the Partnership, Exempted Partnerships and Limited Partnership (Beneficial Ownership) Amendment Act 2018 came into operation on March 23, 2018, and created a requirement for entities (that are not exempt) to maintain and file a register of beneficial ownership with the BMA. There was a six-month transition period for this legislation, which has been further extended, and entities are required to have a beneficial ownership register in place by February 28, 2019. The BMA has confirmed that regulated entities (e.g. insurers registered under the Insurance Act) and listed-entities and their subsidiaries are exempt and do not need to maintain a beneficial ownership register. Therefore, no further action is required by the Company or its Bermuda subsidiaries in respect of the beneficial ownership requirements. 
The Economic Substance Act 2018 and the Economic Substance Regulations 2018 (the “ESA”) came into effect on December 31, 2018, and apply to all Bermuda registered companies, limited liability companies and partnerships with separate legal personality engaged in relevant activities. Existing Bermuda entities have until June 30, 2019 to comply. Additional changes are anticipated to this legislation and further guidance on its application will be provided by the Bermuda authorities. However, the ESA currently provides that all relevant entities (which includes Bermuda companies, limited liability companies and partnerships that have elected to have separate legal personality) engaged in relevant activities must maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda. A relevant activity is defined in the ESA as “banking, insurance, fund management, financing, leasing, headquarters, shipping, distribution and service centre, intellectual property and holding entities”. For companies registered under the Insurance Act, it is anticipated that the ESA will mean little change in practice other than the filing of an annual economic substance declaration. For pure holding companies, the ESA specifies that they only need to meet the minimum requirements, which means compliance with the Companies Act 1981, as amended, the filing of an annual economic substance declaration, and confirmation that such holding companies have “adequate employees for holding and managing equity participations and adequate premises in Bermuda”. The term “adequate” is not defined in the ESA and the scope of the requirement will need to be assessed on a case by case basis in the particular circumstances. Government guidance notes are expected to address the parameters of what constitutes “adequate” for different types of entities. The Company currently has a substantive connection to Bermuda and is monitoring these developments to confirm what if any additional actions may be required.

EMPLOYEES

We do not have any employees. Our CEO and CFO are employees of Sompo International and they provide us with these services pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement and Investment Management Agreement.

We do not have the staff or capability to manage our underwriting or investment practices within our organization. Instead, we have outsourced these functions to the Manager, subject to oversight by our CEO, our CFO and the Board. As a result, the performance of the Manager is critical to our business.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

There are no aspects of our business that require a patent, trademark or copyright. We do not own any patent, trademark or copyright. Sompo International owns the registered Blue Capital® trademark and we have entered into a trademark license agreement with Sompo International providing for a royalty-free license of this trademark. Under the terms of the trademark license agreement, we generally must indemnify Sompo International and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns for, from and against losses: (i) on account of any third-party claim or proceeding arising out of the performance of the trademark license agreement; or (ii) from any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant or obligation of ours contained in the trademark license agreement.
IMPLICATIONS OF BEING A SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY

We qualify as a "smaller reporting company" as defined in Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933. As a result, we are eligible to take advantage of scaled disclosure requirements and financial reporting requirements made available in Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. These scaled disclosure requirements include, but are not limited to:

• | Selected financial data, under Regulation S-K, Item 301 is not required;


• | No requirement to provide supplementary financial information, under Regulation S-K, Item 302;


• | Financial statement schedules, under Regulation S-X, Article 12 are not required;


• | Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are only required to present two years rather than three years of financial results;


• | No risk factors required to be disclosed in filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

 We intend to take advantage of some, but not all, of the scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you invest.
We will continue to qualify to be a smaller reporting company provided we meet the following criteria (i) Public float of less than $250 million; or (ii) Less than $100 million of annual revenues and no public float, or public float of less than $700 million. In addition, we are deemed to be an "accelerated filer," as defined under the Exchange Act. As a result we will remain subject to the requirements that apply to accelerated filers, including the timing of the filing of periodic reports and the requirement that accelerated filers provide the auditor's attestation of management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
