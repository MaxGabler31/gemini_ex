Overview
 SPS Commerce is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management services across our global retail network. Our products make it easier for retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms to orchestrate the management of item data, order fulfillment, inventory control, and sales analytics across omnichannel retail channels. SPS Commerce delivers our products using a full-service model whereby our internal experts monitor, update, and boost network performance on our customers’ behalf.
 The services offered by SPS Commerce eliminate the need for on-premise software and support staff by taking on that capability on the customer’s behalf. The services SPS Commerce provides enable our customers to increase their supply cycle agility, optimize their inventory levels and sell-through, reduce operational costs and gain increased visibility into customer orders, ensuring that suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms can satisfy exacting retailer requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 37,500 customers with ongoing contracts to pay us monthly fees, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers. We also generate revenues by providing our cloud-based supply chain management services to an additional 67,500 organizations that, together with our recurring revenue customers, we refer to as our customers. Once connected to the SPS Commerce cloud-based retail network, our customers often require additional integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our cloud-based network and new sources of revenues for us.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we generated revenues of $385.3 million, $312.6 million, and $279.1 million, respectively. Our quarter ended December 31, 2021 represented our 84th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers accounted for 92%, 94% and 94% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
 Increasing Demand for a Retail Network
 The retail industry has undergone many changes in recent years which have accelerated the need for a more automated supply chain to navigate disruptions and meet growing consumer demands. Companies across the retail ecosystem need to integrate their operations and communications from their wholesale, e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, and marketplace sales channels into a single omnichannel process. These channels no longer operate independently but instead in an interconnected fashion as consumers demand more buying and delivery options. The rise in buy online, pickup in store (BOPIS), is one example of the intersection of e-commerce and wholesale channels. The coordination needed to manage multiple channels has added complexity to supply chains and trading partner relationships.
 The SPS Commerce retail network offers a single destination where customers can manage item details, orders, shipments, invoices, and much more from any channel. The network provides retail businesses with a comprehensive view of retail transactions and gives them the agility to quickly identify opportunities to optimize inventory and fulfill orders, regardless of channel. Customers use our retail network to consolidate all channels into a single system, saving time and reducing errors common when managing complex operations.
 Our Products
 SPS Commerce operates one of the largest retail networks in the world to improve the way retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms manage and fulfill omnichannel orders, optimize sell-through performance, and automate new trading relationships. Approximately 105,000 customers across approximately 80 countries use SPS Commerce products to expand and optimize the performance of their trading relationships through the network.
 The SPS Commerce business model fundamentally changes how organizations use electronic communication to manage their omnichannel, supply chain, and other business requirements. Our products replace the collection of traditional, custom-built, point-to-point integrations with a model that facilitates a single automated connection to the entire SPS Commerce retail network that offers prebuilt connections to thousands of global trading partners.
 From that single network connection, a customer can make use of the full suite of our products with any trading partner, from fulfillment automation to the analysis and optimization of item sell-through performance. These cloud-based products deliver value as stand-alone offerings but can also provide greater value when used collectively. This represents a fundamental change to order fulfillment automation and enables inherent adaptability and flexibility not possible with traditional supply chain management system architectures.

Our Fulfillment product allows suppliers and logistics firms to comply with numerous rulebooks that govern the details of trading relationships with retailers, grocers, and distributors. Maintaining current connections with these buying organizations removes the need for their trading partners to continually stay up to date with their required rulebook changes to remain compliant.
 SPS Commerce offers the following major products:
  
• | Fulfillment - The Fulfillment product provides fulfillment automation and replaces or augments an organization’s existing staff and trading partner electronic communication infrastructure by enabling easy compliance with retailers’ rulebooks, automatic, digital exchange of information among numerous trading partners through various protocols, and greater visibility into the journey of an order.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analytics - The Analytics product consists of data analytics applications that enable our customers to improve their visibility across their supply chains through greater analytics capabilities. When focused on point-of-sale data, for example, retailers and suppliers can ensure inventory is located where demand is highest. Additionally, retailers improve their visibility into supplier performance and their understanding of product sell-through.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Products - We provide several complimentary products, such as our assortment product (which enables accurate order management and rapid fulfillment) and our community product (which accelerates vendor onboarding and ensures trading partner adoption of new supply chain requirements).

Growing Our Network
 As one of the largest providers of cloud-based services for retail supply chain management, the trading partner relationships that we enable among our retailer, supplier, grocer, distributor, and logistics firms naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities.
“Network Effect”
 Once connected to our retail network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other. The value of our network increases with the number of trading partners connected to it. As one of the largest retail networks, customers often find that many of their existing or new trading partners are already on the network, allowing for easy connections. The addition of each new customer enables that new customer to communicate with our existing customers and permits our existing customers to do business with the new customer. This “network effect” of adding additional customers to our products’ infrastructure creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa. As a result of this increased volume of activity among our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants.
Customer Acquisition Sources
 Community. As retailers and suppliers reshape how they do business in an omnichannel landscape, they need to bring new capabilities and services to their trading partner networks. Our Community product is designed to manage this process and bring suppliers into compliance with new requirements. For instance, a supplier may wish to collaborate with their retailers around point-of-sale analytics data, or a retailer may decide to change the workflow or protocol by which it interacts with its suppliers. In each case, the supplier and retailer may engage us to work with its trading partner base to enable the new capability. Performing these programs on behalf of retailers and suppliers generates supplier sales leads for us.
 Referrals from Our Customers. We also receive sales leads from our customers seeking to communicate electronically with their trading partners. For example, a supplier may refer its third-party logistics provider or manufacturer, which is not in our network, to us.
 Direct Marketing. We employ various marketing strategies. Our marketing programs include a variety of lead generating activities including digital marketing, conferences and tradeshows, sponsored events, and public relations activities targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.
 Channel Partners. In addition to the customer acquisition sources identified above, we market and sell our products through a variety of channel partners, including software providers, resellers, system integrators, and logistics partners. For example, software partners such as Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Sage, and their business partner communities generate sales for us as part of broader enterprise resource planning, warehouse management system and/or transportation management system sales efforts. Our logistics partners also drive new sales both by providing leads and by embedding our products as part of their service offerings.

Our Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to be the leading global retail network and provider of supply chain management products. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Further Penetrate Our Current Market. We believe the global supply chain management market is underpenetrated and, as the retail industry continues to respond to the changing requirements of the omnichannel marketplace, and as the supply chain ecosystem becomes more complex and geographically dispersed, the demand for supply chain management solutions will increase. We intend to continue leveraging our relationships with customers and their trading partners to obtain new sales leads.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Revenues from Our Customer Base. We believe our overall customer satisfaction is strong and will lead our customers to further expand their use of our products they have purchased, as well as purchase additional products to continue improving the performance of their trading partner relationships, generating additional revenues for us. We also expect to introduce new products to sell to our customers. We believe our position as the incumbent supply chain management solution provider to our customers, our integration into our recurring revenue customers’ business systems, and the modular nature of our cloud-based products are conducive to deploying additional products with customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our Distribution Channels. We intend to grow our business by expanding our sales capacity to gain new customers. We also believe there are valuable opportunities to promote and sell our products through collaboration with other providers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our International Presence. We believe our presence in Asia Pacific, as well as in Europe, represents a significant competitive advantage. We plan to increase our global sales efforts to obtain new customers around the world. We intend to leverage our current global presence to increase the number of integrations we have with retailers in foreign markets to make our products more valuable to their trading partners based overseas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance and Expand Our Services. We intend to further improve and develop the functionality and features of our cloud-based products, including, from time to time, developing new offerings and applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. The nature of our market provides an opportunity for selective acquisitions. We plan to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions based on the number of new customers, revenue, functionality, or geographic reach the acquisition would provide relative to the purchase price and our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business. In 2021, we acquired Genius Central Systems, Inc., a leading provider of in-aisle order management and software products for natural and specialty food providers. In 2020, we acquired D Masons Software, LLC (“Data Masons”), a leading provider of electronic data interchange (“EDI”) products for the Microsoft Dynamics market. These acquisitions further extend the capabilities of our network and added new customers and technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Market Opportunity
 We believe we have a significant market opportunity in helping organizations accelerate their omnichannel retail strategies with our retail network and supply chain products. 
 
 
• | Omnichannel retail requires new connections/transactions. Each sales channel (wholesale, e-commerce, drop-ship and marketplaces) brings new trading partners to the supply chain process. As customers expand their business, the SPS Commerce retail network is a core part of their omnichannel strategy. Each additional channel brings more reliance and volume to the network and increases customer revenue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail needs automation. With increased retail store openings and closings, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and new online buying patterns, retailers are demanding more from their trading partners as they need to be agile and transition their businesses as markets change. Businesses using SPS Commerce products to automate supply chain functions with their trading partners are able to pivot quickly to new delivery models and capture market share. The visibility to orders, shipments and inventory gained by automating trading relationships on the SPS Commerce retail network is critical to their success and offers a competitive advantage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumers want new products. Retail assortments are everchanging with seasonality shifts and new product introductions from companies of all sizes. Consumers want the latest products and retailers are continually chasing trends, offering differentiated items, and introducing new products and suppliers to their supply chains. As retailers evolve, their trading partner relationships must support any new product introductions or new suppliers to achieve their merchandising goals. The SPS Commerce retail network automates these relationships to quickly secure product details, initiate orders, and track performance to help keep operations running smoothly.

Technology, Development and Operations
 Technology
 SPS Commerce was an early provider of cloud-services to the retail supply chain management industry, launching the first version of what would become our current services in 1997. We use commercially available hardware and cloud-services with a combination of proprietary and commercially available software.
 Our cloud-service model treats all customers as logically separate tenants within a shared virtual infrastructure. As a result, we spread the cost of delivering our products across our customer base. Because we do not manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemes, we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that modified their products to be accessible over the Internet.
 Development
 Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining, improving, and enhancing our existing products, as well as developing new products and applications. Our multi-tenant products serve all of our customers, which allows us to maintain relatively low research and development expenses and release software updates more frequently compared to traditional on-premise licensed software products that support multiple versions. Our development efforts take place at our U.S. locations in Minnesota and New Jersey, as well as in Melbourne, Australia; Toronto, Canada; and Kyiv, Ukraine.
Operations
 We operate our infrastructure in third-party data centers located throughout the United States and in Australia, as well as provisioned services in cloud providers. In most cases, infrastructure and services are managed by us.
 We have internal and third-party monitoring software that continually checks our cloud-based network and key underlying components for continuous availability and performance, helping ensure that the network is always available and providing desired service levels. We have a technology engineering team that includes system provisioning, management, maintenance, monitoring, and back-up.
 We operate a service architecture using industry best practices to ensure multiple points of redundancy, high availability, and scale as needed. Our databases are replicated between locations with a defined recovery point objective.
 Sales & Marketing 
 We sell our products through an employed global sales force that focuses on retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms.
 Our marketing teams focus on driving awareness and demand for our products through the following activities:
  
• | Demand Generation. Engages with target audiences using the latest digital marketing strategies to bring opportunities to our sales teams.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Communications. Manages our brand, public relations, and go-to-market support.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product Marketing. Equips our sales teams, performs market studies, and promotes the unique capabilities of each of our products using our go-to-market strategies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Events. Highlights our presence at industry tradeshows as well as orchestrates virtual and in-person events.

Customer Success
 The Customer Success team is made up of retail and technology experts who implement our products on the customer’s behalf, provide ongoing support, and collaborate with accounts to identify opportunities for added value from their existing products. This team focuses on delivering services that build customer satisfaction and result in high customer retention rates. 
Competition
 Vendors in the supply chain management industry offer products through three delivery methods: traditional on-premise software, cloud-based managed services, and cloud-based full-service products.
 The market for cloud-based supply chain management products is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Cloud-service vendors compete directly with each other based mainly on the following:
  
• | the breadth of pre-built network connections to retailers, third-party logistics providers, and other trading partners;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a history of establishing and maintaining reliable connections with trading partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the reputation of the cloud-service vendor in the supply chain management industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | price;
--+-------


• | specialization in a customer market segment;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | speed and quality with which the cloud-service vendor can integrate its customers to their trading partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | functionality of the cloud-service product, such as the ability to integrate the product with a customer’s business systems;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth of complementary supply chain management products the cloud-service vendor offers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | training and customer support services provided during and after a customer’s initial integration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to encounter new and increased competition as this market segment consolidates and matures. Consolidation among cloud-service vendors could create a direct competitor that can compete with us more effectively than the numerous, smaller vendors currently offering cloud-service supply chain management products. Increased competition from cloud-service vendors could reduce our market share, revenues, and operating margins or otherwise adversely affect our business.
 Cloud-service vendors also compete with traditional on-premise software companies. Traditional on-premise software companies focused on supply chain integration management include IBM Sterling and OpenText. These companies offer a “do-it-yourself” method in which customers purchase, install, and manage specialized software, hardware, and value-added networks for their supply chain integration needs. This method requires customers to invest in staff to operate and maintain the software. Traditional on-premise software companies use a single-tenant approach in which information maps to retailers are built for and used by one supplier, as compared to cloud-service products that allow multiple customers to share information maps with a retailer.
 Managed service providers focused on the supply chain management market include IBM Sterling, OpenText, TrueCommerce and many other small providers. These companies offer a cloud-based product in which they develop and maintain the core technology, while the customer’s internal staff is responsible for the day-to-day customization, optimization, and operations of the technology.
In contrast, full-service providers, including SPS Commerce, offer cloud-based products that customize, optimize, and operate the technology. This approach offloads the time-intensive process of managing these products, which is not a core competency for most businesses. 
 Customers of traditional on-premise software providers must typically make significant upfront investments in the supply chain management products these competitors provide, which can decrease the customers’ willingness to abandon their investments in favor of a cloud-service product. Cloud-service vendors compete with these traditional software products based on the total cost of ownership and flexibility. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Content
 SPS Commerce relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and additional third parties, and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.

Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We do not have any patents, but we have pending patent applications. Our trade secrets consist primarily of the software we have developed for our SPS Commerce cloud-based products and network. Our software is also protected under copyright law, but we do not have any registered copyrights.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed people across the following functional areas:
 
 
 | # of Employees | 
---------------------------+----------------+------
Cost of revenues | | 959 
Sales and marketing | | 460 
Research and development | | 332 
General and administrative | | 150 
Total employees | | 1,901

 
We also engage independent contractors to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. 
 We believe our employees have and will continue to be a primary reason for our growth and success. SPS values diversity, equity and inclusion and believes that our differences make us, our customers, and our communities better. Team SPS is driven to influence those around us by cultivating an inclusive culture that values every individual and brings positive and lasting change. We offer competitive benefits as well as training, development, review, and feedback programs to develop employees’ expertise and skillsets, as well as strive to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment guided by principles of fair and equal treatment and prioritize employee engagement. As a result, we believe our employees are committed to building strong, innovative, and long-term relationships with each other and our organization in order to succeed together and with our customers. 
 We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others in our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and that align individual performance with our success. The health of our employees is also very important to us. In response to the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have, where possible, offered remote work flexibility beginning in March 2020 which has continued through December 2021, without significant impacts to productivity.
