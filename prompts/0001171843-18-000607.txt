Item 1.     Business
 
Overview
 
We operate in the gold mining industry, primarily focused on advancing permitting of the Donlin Gold project in Alaska. The Donlin Gold project is held by Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), a limited liability company owned equally by wholly-owned subsidiaries of NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”). We are also committed to maximizing the value of our interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada. The Galore Creek project is held by a partnership owned equally by NOVAGOLD Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NOVAGOLD, and by Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”). We continue to explore opportunities to sell, in whole or in part, our interest in the Galore Creek project.
 
We do not produce gold or any other minerals, and do not currently generate operating earnings. Funding to explore our mineral properties and to operate the Company was acquired primarily through previous equity financings consisting of public offerings of our common shares and warrants and through debt financing consisting of convertible notes. We expect to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings, through the exercise of stock options, and otherwise.
 
We were incorporated by memorandum of association on December 5, 1984, under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia) as 1562756 Nova Scotia Limited. On January 14, 1985, we changed our name to NovaCan Mining Resources (l985) Limited and on March 20, 1987, we changed our name to NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. On May 29, 2013, our shareholders approved the continuance of the corporation into British Columbia. Subsequently, we filed the necessary documents in Nova Scotia and British Columbia and we continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) effective as of June 10, 2013. The current addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers of our offices are:

Recent Developments
 
Donlin Gold Project
 
Permitting activities continued at Donlin Gold in 2017 and were mainly focused on advancing major permits and approvals with state and federal agencies. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), the lead federal agency for the Donlin Gold Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), completed the cooperating agency review of the preliminary final EIS. The EIS is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the act that governs the process by which most major projects in the United States are evaluated. The final EIS is required before the Corps can issue a record of decision on Donlin Gold’s Clean Water Act Section 404 (wetland) and Section 10 (rivers and harbors) permit application. The Corps anticipates publishing the final EIS in early 2018, with a record of decision expected in the second half of 2018. All Donlin Gold EIS documents, including the Corps’ time table for the Donlin Gold EIS process, can be found on their website at www.donlingoldeis.com.
 
In addition to actively participating in the NEPA process, Donlin Gold continues to work simultaneously with the Corps and other permitting agencies to advance major permits. Donlin Gold remains actively engaged in sponsorship activities at the community level, supporting local youth in leadership endeavors, visiting communities in the Y-K region and executing on its workforce development strategy.
 
In 2017, Donlin Gold conducted a 16 hole, 7,040 meter core drilling program in support of ongoing engineering and optimization efforts.
 
For further information, see section Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
 
Galore Creek Project
 
During 2017, efforts were focused on site care and maintenance. We continue to be open to monetizing, in whole or in part, our 50% share of the Galore Creek project to strengthen our balance sheet and to contribute toward the development of the Donlin Gold project.
 
For further information, see section Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
 
Reclamation
 
We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. In addition, financial assurance acceptable to the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over reclamation must be provided in an amount that the authority determines to be sufficient to allow the authority to implement the reclamation plan in the event that we fail to complete the work as provided in the plan.

Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Our exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in the United States and Canada. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. For a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations, see section Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to obtain the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
Most aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, metallurgy, mine planning, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing, legal and accounting. Historically, we have found that we can locate and retain appropriate employees and consultants and we believe we will continue to be able to do so.
 
All of the raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in the United States and Canada. Historically, we have been able to secure the appropriate equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal as our mineral exploration and development activities take place in southwestern Alaska and northern British Columbia. Due to the northern climate, work on the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek projects can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface work often is limited to late spring through early fall, although work in some locations, which may more efficiently be accessed while frozen, occurs in the winter.
Gold Price History
 
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand, in addition to international and national political and economic conditions.
 
The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixed prices in U.S. dollars for an ounce of gold on the London Bullion Market over the past five calendar years:
 

Year | High | | Low | Average
---------------------+------+-------+-----+--------

2014 | $ | 1,385 | | $ | 1,142 | $ | 1,266
2015 | $ | 1,296 | | $ | 1,049 | $ | 1,160
2016 | $ | 1,366 | | $ | 1,077 | $ | 1,251
2017 | $ | 1,346 | | $ | 1,151 | $ | 1,257
2018 (to January 17) | $ | 1,339 | | $ | 1,311 | $ | 1,322
