Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of our proprietary MicroNet™ stent platform technology for the treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease. A stent is an expandable “scaffold-like” device, usually constructed of a metallic material, that is inserted into an artery to expand the inside passage and improve blood flow. Our MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is wrapped over a stent to provide embolic protection in stenting procedures.
 
Our CGuard™ carotid embolic prevention system (“CGuard EPS”) combines MicroNet and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Our CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013, and we launched its release on a limited basis in October 2014. In January 2015, a new version of CGuard, with a rapid exchange delivery system, received CE mark approval in Europe and in September 2015, we announced the full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in Russia and certain countries in Latin America and Asia, and, in January 2018, received regulatory approval to commercialize CGuard EPS in India. If we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, we plan to develop CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge), which we intend to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds. We cannot give any assurance that we will receive sufficient (or any) proceeds from any such financings or the timing of such financings, if ever. In addition, such additional financings may be costly or difficult to complete.
 
Our MGuard™ Prime™ Embolic Protection System (“MGuard Prime EPS”) is marketed for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions (bypass surgery). MGuard Prime EPS combines MicroNet with a bare-metal cobalt-chromium based stent and, together with our first generation MGuard stent combining MicroNet with a bare-metal stainless steel stent, unless otherwise indicated, we refer to both kinds of bare-metal stents as our MGuard coronary products. We market and sell MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of coronary disease in the European Union. MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 for improving luminal diameter and providing embolic protection. However, as a result of a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, in 2014 we decided to curtail further development of this product in order to focus on the development of a drug-eluting stent product, MGuard DES™. Due to limited resources, though, our efforts have been limited to testing drug-eluting stents manufactured by potential partners for compatibility with MicroNet and seeking to incorporate MicroNet onto a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a potential partner.
 
We are also developing a neurovascular flow diverter (“NGuard”), which is an endovascular device that directs blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms in order to ultimately seal the aneurysms. Our flow diverter would utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold to which MicroNet would be attached. We have completed initial pre-clinical testing of this product in both simulated bench models and standard in vivo pre-clinical models. However, as we plan to focus our resources on the further expansion of our sales and marketing activities for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS and, provided that we have sufficient resources, the development of CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge) and its submission for CE mark approval, we do not intend to resume further development of NGuard until we obtain sufficient funding for such purpose.
 
We also intend to develop a pipeline of other products and additional applications by leveraging our MicroNet technology to new applications to improve peripheral vascular and neurovascular procedures, such as the treatment of the superficial femoral artery disease, vascular disease below the knee and neurovascular stenting to seal aneurysms in the brain.

Presently, none of our products may be sold or marketed in the United States.
 
In 2017, we decided to shift our commercial strategy to focus on sales of our products through local distribution partners and our own internal sales initiatives to gain greater reach into all the relevant clinical specialties and to expand our geographic coverage. Pursuant to our new strategy, we completed our transition away from a single distributor covering 18 European countries to a direct distribution model intended to broaden our sales efforts to key clinical specialties. All territories previously covered by our former European distributor have been transferred to local distributors by June 2017. We also have begun to participate in international trade shows and industry conferences in an attempt to gain market exposure and brand recognition.


We were organized in the State of Delaware on February 29, 2008.


Recent Developments
 
On March 14, 2017, we closed a “best efforts” public offering of 1,069,822 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), Series B warrants to purchase 122,269 shares of common stock and Series C warrants to purchase 122,269 shares of common stock. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into 0.114 shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $56.00 per share. The Series B warrants are exercisable immediately and have a term of exercise of five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $70.00 per share of common stock. The Series C warrants were exercisable immediately, had a term of six months and had an exercise price of $56.00 per share of common stock. The Series C warrants expired on September 14, 2017. We received gross proceeds of approximately $6.8 million from the offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.


On December 1, 2017, as part of a planned recapitalization, we sold 750 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D Preferred Stock”) to an institutional investor in a private placement (the “Series D Private Placement”) pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (the “Series D Purchase Agreement”), dated November 28, 2017, for aggregate gross proceeds of $750,000. The stated value of each share of Series D Preferred Stock is $1,000 and the conversion price is $7.00. As a result of the issuance and sale of the Series D Preferred Stock, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) was reduced to $7.00 pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock. There was no change to the conversion price of our outstanding Series C Preferred Stock as a result of an amendment made to the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock exempting the issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock from the anti-dilution adjustment provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock.
 
On August 17, 2017, we received a notice from NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”) indicating that we do not meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE American as set forth in Part 10 of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”). Specifically, we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide because we reported stockholders’ equity of less than $6 million as of June 30, 2017, and net losses in our five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2016. As a result, we became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide. On October 24, 2017, NYSE American accepted our plan to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by February 7, 2019. We are subject to periodic review by the NYSE American staff during the period covered by the compliance plan. Failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the plan period could result in our common stock being delisted from the NYSE American.

On November 22, 2017, we received an additional letter from the NYSE American indicating that we are not in compliance with the stockholders’ equity and net income continued listing standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide. We have until February 17, 2019, to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements.
 
On January 16, 2018, we received notification from the NYSE American that we are not in compliance with certain NYSE American continued listing standards. The deficiency letter states that our shares of common stock have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time. Pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the NYSE American staff determined that our continued listing is predicated on us effecting a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the staff determined to be until July 16, 2018.
 
Effective as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 7, 2018, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in order to effectuate a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. Although we expect that the reverse stock split will result in an increase in the market price of our common stock, the reverse stock split may not result in a permanent increase in the market price of our common stock, which is dependent on many factors, including general economic, market and industry conditions and other factors. We have adjusted all outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, preferred stock and warrants entitling the holders to purchase shares of our common stock as a result of the reverse stock split, as required by the terms of these securities. In particular, we have reduced the conversion ratio for each security, and increased the exercise price in accordance with the terms of each security based on the reverse stock split ratio (i.e., the number of shares issuable under such securities has been divided by thirty-five, and the exercise price per share has been multiplied by thirty-five). Also, we reduced the number of shares reserved for issuance under the InspireMD, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, proportionately based on the reverse stock split ratio. The reverse stock split does not otherwise affect any of the rights currently accruing to holders of our common stock, or options or warrants exercisable for our common stock. All share and related option and warrant information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reduced number of shares outstanding and the increase in share price which resulted from this action.

Our Industry 
 
Carotid
 
Carotid arteries are located on each side of the neck and provide the primary blood supply to the brain. Carotid artery disease, also called carotid artery stenosis, is a type of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that is one of the major risk factors for ischemic stroke. In carotid artery disease, plaque accumulates in the artery walls, narrowing the artery and disrupting the blood supply to the brain. This disruption in blood supply, together with plaque debris breaking off the artery walls and traveling to the brain, are the primary causes of stroke. According to the World Heart Federation (http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/stroke/, last visited on Mar. 11, 2016), every year, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, and nearly six million die and another five million are left permanently disabled. According to the same source, stroke is the second leading cause of disability, after dementia.
 
The potential global market value of carotid stents is approximately $500 million, approximately $300 million of which consists of the U.S. market and approximately $200 million of which consists of the rest of the world (source: JMP Securities 2014 and Cowen 2014). Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive treatment option for carotid artery disease and an alternative to carotid endarterectomy, where a surgeon accesses the blocked carotid artery though an incision in the neck, and then surgically removes the plaque. Endovascular techniques using stents and carotid embolic prevention system protect against plaque and debris traveling downstream, blocking off the vessel and disrupting blood flow. We believe that the use of a stent with an embolic protection system should increase the number of patients being treated since it would avoid the need for complex surgery.

Coronary
 
Physicians and patients may select from a variety of treatments to address coronary artery disease, including pharmaceutical therapy, balloon angioplasty, stenting with bare metal or drug-eluting stents, and coronary artery bypass graft procedures, with the selection often depending upon the stage of the disease.
 
The global market value of coronary products is estimated at $5.9 billion, of which $4.2 billion is for stable angina and $1.7 billion is for acute myocardial infarctions according to Health Research International (June 2011). According to the 2014 MEDTECH OUTLOOK produced in December 2013 by BMO Capital Markets (“MEDTECH OUTLOOK”), revenues from the global coronary stent market are predicted to slightly decline, although in volume of stents the market is predicted to continue to grow. We believe the growth in volume is due to the appeal for less invasive percutaneous coronary intervention (“PCI”) procedures and advances in technology coupled with the increase in the elderly population, obesity rates and advances in technology.
 
Neurovascular
 
The neurovascular market focuses on catheter-delivered products used to treat strokes that already happened or unruptured brain aneurysms that could lead to strokes. In the latter case, coils are wound into blood vessel bulges to block blood flow entering the aneurysms to prevent the aneurysms from rupturing. Endovascular treatment of arterial aneurysm has evolved substantially over the past two decades, transitioning from an investigational therapy into routine clinical practice and ultimately emerging as the treatment of choice for many lesions (source: Medtech Ventures 2009, Aneurysm Flow Modulating Device Market). We believe that the market for aneurysm flow modulating devices is still in the embryonic stage with windows of opportunities for early entrance.
 
The current global market for the aneurysm flow modulating devices is estimated at $550 million, and the current market value of the flow diversion market segment is estimated to be $125 million. The neurovascular market includes over-the-wire, flow-guided microcatheters, guiding catheters, coil and liquid embolics, neurovascular stents and flow diversion stents. According to iData Research, the market is expected to be driven by the conversion from surgical procedures to endovascular techniques in the treatment of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations.
 
Peripheral
 
Peripheral vascular diseases (“PVD”) are caused by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries, which carry blood to organs, limbs and head. It is also known as peripheral artery occlusive disease or peripheral artery disease. It comprises diseases pertaining to both peripheral veins and peripheral arteries, affecting the peripheral and cardiac circulation in the body. PVD includes diseases outside of the heart and brain, but most times refers to the leg and foot.
 
The global market value of PVDs is estimated at $1.6 billion by 2017 (source: Global Data 2011). The overall peripheral vascular devices market consists of nine different product segments: peripheral vascular stents, chronic total occlusion devices, peripheral transluminal angioplasty balloon catheters, atherectomy devices, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty guidewires, aortic stents, embolic protection devices, synthetic surgical grafts and inferior vena cava filters (source: Grand View Research 2014). Treatment modalities and methods have considerably improved during the last several years, and this trend is expected to continue (source: Global Data 2011). Stents and balloons hold the majority of the share in the peripheral vascular devices market. Peripheral stents are more often used in combination with balloon angioplasty to open the veins, so that blood can flow through the blocked veins in the body.

The growing prevalence of PVD is expected to cause increased demand for treatment options. The expansion of the elderly population is contributing to increasing incidence rates of PVD. The percentage of the global population above the age of 50 is expected to reach 17% by 2030. As the risk of developing PVD increases with age, a growing elderly population translates into a growing incidence of PVD (source: Global Data 2011). The growing global geriatric population base also triggers increasing demand for minimally invasive endovascular procedures on account of their shorter recovery time, lesser scaring and lesser chances of post-surgery infections. In addition, a growing prevalence of disease causing lifestyle factors and eating habits such as high consumption of alcohol and tobacco products is expected to boost peripheral vascular devices market demand by triggering the incidence rates of cardiac arrest, blood clotting and other vascular diseases (source: Grand View Research 2014).
 
Our Products
 
Below is a summary of our current products and products under development, and their intended applications.
 
MicroNet
 
MicroNet is our proprietary circular knitted mesh which wraps around a stent to protect patients from plaque debris flowing downstream upon deployment. MicroNet is made of a single fiber from a biocompatible polymer widely used in medical implantations. The size, or aperture, of the current MicroNet ‘pore’ is only 150-180 microns in order to maximize protection against the potentially dangerous plaque and thrombus.
CGuard – Carotid Applications
 
Our CGuard EPS combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol stent (a stent that expands without balloon dilation pressure or need of an inflation balloon) in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. MicroNet is placed over and attached to an open cell nitinol metal stent platform which is designed to trap debris and emboli that can dislodge from the diseased carotid artery and potentially travel to the brain and cause a stroke. This danger is one of the greatest limitations of carotid artery stenting with conventional carotid stents and stenting methods. The CGuard EPS technology is a highly flexible stent system that conforms to the carotid anatomy.
 
We believe that our CGuard EPS design provides advantages over existing therapies in treating carotid artery stenosis, such as conventional carotid stenting and surgical endarterectomy, given the superior embolic protection characteristics provided by the MicroNet. We believe the MicroNet will provide acute embolic protection at the time of the procedure, but more importantly, we believe that CGuard EPS will provide post-procedure protection against embolic dislodgement, which can occur up to 48 hours post-procedure. It is in this post-procedure time frame that embolization is the source of post-procedural strokes in the brain. Schofer, et al. (“Late cerebral embolization after emboli-protected carotid artery stenting assessed by sequential diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,” Journal of American College of Cardiology Cardiovascular Interventions, Volume 1, 2008) have shown that the majority of the incidents of embolic showers associated with carotid stenting occur post-procedure.
 
Our CGuard EPS with over-the-wire delivery system received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013. In October 2014, we initiated a limited market release of CGuard EPS with over-the-wire delivery system for use in carotid artery applications in Germany, Poland and Italy.
 
In September 2014, we reported the results of the CGuard CARENET trial at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (“TCT”) conference in Washington D.C. In the CARENET trial, the CGuard EPS system demonstrated better results over historical data using conventional commercially available carotid stents. In the third quarter of 2015 the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.

In the first quarter of 2015, we introduced CGuard RX, the new rapid exchange delivery system for CGuard EPS. The rapid exchange delivery system has a guidewire that passes through the delivery system, running through the guiding catheter. It has one port, and thus, can be operated by one operator, while an over-the-wire-delivery system has two lumens and ports and requires two operators to perform the procedure. Our rapid exchange delivery system received CE mark approval in January 2015. We launched our CGuard EPS in Europe with the rapid exchange delivery system in multiple medical specialties that perform carotid artery stenting. These customers include interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists.
 
In September 2015, we announced full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in Russia and certain countries in Latin America and Asia, and, in January 2018, received regulatory approval to commercialize CGuard EPS in India.
 
In April 2017, we had a pre-investigational device exemption (“IDE”) submission meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding CGuard EPS where we presented materials that we believed would support a formal IDE submission seeking approval to conduct a human clinical trial in the United States which included our draft synopsis for the clinical trial design. We look forward to proceeding with the formal submission once sufficient funds are available.
 
If we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, we plan to develop CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge), which we intend to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds. Based on the level of interest in this product that we have observed in our clinical trials, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to meet the market demand for minimally invasive devices, which, we believe, may have broader and easier usage, and for a lower profile system used in procedures in which predilation could be problematic. We also believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to have a competitive advantage in penetrating the Asia Pacific market, since its population is generally smaller than in Western countries. In addition, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to offer CGuard EPS for use in transradial catheterization, which, we believe, is gaining favor among interventionalists. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will receive sufficient (or any) proceeds from any future financings or the timing of such financings, if ever. In addition, such additional financings may be costly or difficult to complete. Even if we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, there is no assurance that we will be able to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds.
 
MGuard Products– Coronary Applications
 
Bare-Metal Stent MGuard Product. Our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product is comprised of MicroNet wrapped around a cobalt-chromium based bare-metal stent. In comparison to a conventional bare-metal stent, we believe our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product with MicroNet mesh provides protection from dangerous embolic showers in patients experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the most severe form of a heart attack, referred to as STEMI. Standard stents were not engineered for heart attack patients. Rather, they were designed for treating stable angina patients whose occlusion is different from that of an occlusion in a heart attack patient. In acute heart attack patients, the plaque or thrombus is unstable and often breaks up as the stent is implanted causing downstream blockages in a significant portion of heart attack patients. Our MGuard Prime EPS is integrated with a precisely engineered micro net mesh that is designed to prevent the unstable arterial plaque and thrombus that caused the heart attack blockage from breaking off.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2014, due to a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, we decided to curtail developing and promoting our bare-metal stent platform and instead focus on the development of a drug-eluting stent product, which, as further discussed below, has been tabled at this time. Although we have curtailed development and promotion of MGuard Prime EPS, our distributors and sales staff generally cover all of our current products in the market, including MGuard Prime EPS.

Drug-Eluting Stent MicroNet Product Candidate. During 2015, we completed the second phase of development work for our MGuard DES, pursuant to which we incorporated our MicroNet with a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a prospective partner. We believe that a drug-eluting stent with MicroNet has the potential to improve certain performance metrics over the MGuard Prime EPS and attract a broader portion of the cardiologists in the worldwide stent market who are more accustomed to using drug-eluting stents. However, due to our limited resources we have tabled further development of MGuard DES at this time.
 
NGuard — Neurovascular Applications
 
We began developing a neurovascular flow diverter, which we refer to as NGuard, which is an endovascular device that diverts blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms and ultimately seals the aneurysms. Flow diversion is a growing market segment within the neurovascular medical device field. Current commercial flow diverters are highly flexible dense metal mesh tubes that go across most types of cerebral aneurysms and divert the blood flow away from the aneurysm with the desired end result of sealing the aneurysm. The challenges with the current flow diverters are that they (i) are difficult to place given the high metal content in the device, which makes it more difficult to move the device through the delivery system due to resistance from the metal, and to subsequently accurately place it, (ii) need to be accurately placed to avoid crossing and blocking other cerebral vessels, which could cause additional damage by cutting off blood flow to sections of the brain, (iii) require chronic use of anti-thrombotic medications due to the amount of metal in the cerebral vasculature, which could cause thrombotic complications, and (iv) do not allow a physician to re-access the aneurysm if the aneurysm does not seal, in which event the aneurysm may need to be treated with another therapy such as aneurysm coils, due to the tight metal mesh that will not allow other devices to pass through the flow diverter.
 
Our flow diverter prototype will include our MicroNet that has been employed in CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS. MicroNet has already demonstrated the ability to effectively seal aneurysms in human coronary arteries using the MGuard Prime EPS and aneurysms in the carotid arteries using CGuard EPS in human clinical situations without the need for additional devices or procedures (coils or a second stent) (source: Journal of Medical Case Reports http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/4/1/238). For our flow diverter, we plan to utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold to which MicroNet would be attached. We believe our flow diverter could be more accurately delivered due to a lower metal content scaffold than current commercial flow diverters. Lower metal content in our flow diverter may reduce the need for long-term anticoagulation; the open cell metal scaffold combined with the MicroNet may allow passage of other devices through the MicroNet mesh without compromising the MicroNet, thus allowing a physician to reaccess the aneurysm, if needed; and our flow diverter should be capable of being delivered through a state-of-the-art microcatheter for accurate placement without constant repositioning. We have tested early flow diverter prototypes in initial pre-clinical testing in both simulated aneurysm bench models using various MicroNet configurations with varying aperture sizes, as well as in standard in vivo pre-clinical models, in which we observed aneurysm sealing and also wide open side branch vessels across which the device was placed. We have suspended all further development activity of NGuard until we obtain sufficient funding for such purpose.


PVGuard — Peripheral Vascular Applications
 
We intend to develop our MicroNet mesh sleeve and a self-expandable stent for use in peripheral vascular applications, to which we refer to as PVGuard. PVDs are usually characterized by the accumulation of plaque in arteries in the legs. This accumulation can lead to the need for amputation or even death, when untreated. PVD is treated either by trying to clear the artery of the blockage, or by implanting a stent in the affected area to push the blockage out of the way of normal blood flow.
 
As in carotid procedures, peripheral procedures are characterized by the necessity of controlling embolic showers both during and post-procedure. Controlling embolic showers is so important in these indications that physicians often use fully covered stents, at the risk of blocking branching vessels, to ensure that emboli do not fall into the bloodstream and move to the brain. We believe that our MicroNet design will provide substantial advantages over existing therapies in treating peripheral artery stenosis.

However, as we plan to focus our resources on the further expansion of our sales and marketing activities for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS and, provided that we have sufficient resources, the development of CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge) and its submission for CE mark approval, we do not intend to pursue the development of PVGuard in the near future.
 
Completed Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS 
 
CARENET 
 
The CARENET trial was the first multi-center study of CGuard EPS following the receipt of CE mark of this device in March 2013. The CARENET trial was designed to evaluate feasibility and safety of CGuard EPS in treatment of carotid lesions in consecutive patients suitable for coronary artery stenting (“CAS”) in a multi-operator, real-life setting. The acute, 30 day, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), ultrasound and six month clinical event results were presented at the LINC conference in Leipzig, Germany in February, 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.
 
MACCE (myocardial infarction (“MI”), stroke or death) was 0.0% at 30 days. At six months, there was one case of death, which was not stent or procedure-related, and MACCE was increased to 3.6%. At twelve months there were three cases of death, which were not stent or procedure-related, and MACCE was 11.1%.
 

 | 30 days (n=30) | | 6 months (n=28) | | 12 months (n=27) | 
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+---+---------------------+---+----------------------+--

CAS carries the risk of cerebral embolization during and following the procedure, leading to life-threatening complications, mainly cerebral ischemic events. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a sensitive tool used to identify cerebral emboli during CAS by measuring “lesions” within the brain which are areas that are ischemic and do not receive oxygenated blood due to cerebral emboli. In the CARENET trial, 37.0% of patients treated with CGuard EPS had new ischemic lesions at 48 hours after the procedure, with an average volume of 0.039 cm3. Of these lesions, there was only one that remained at 30 days following the procedure and all others had resolved. Complete details appear in the following table. Where there is a second number shown below after a ±, it indicates the rate of error.

The healing process of the tissue and in-stent restenosis can be measured by a non-invasive form of ultrasound called duplex ultrasound. This type of ultrasound measures the velocity of the blood that flows within the carotid arteries, which increases exponentially as the lumen of the internal carotid artery narrows and the percent stenosis increases. One of the measurements is called PSV (peak systolic volume) and is known to be highly correlated to the degree of in-stent restenosis; PSV values higher than 300 cm/sec are indicative of >70% stenosis, while PSV values lower than 104 cm/sec are indicative of <30% restenosis and healthy healing. In the CARENET trial, duplex ultrasound measurements done at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months following the stenting procedure all attest to healthy normal healing without restenosis concerns, as the PSV values were 60.96 cm/sec ± 22.31, 85.24 cm/sec ± 39.56, and 90.22 cm/sec ± 37.72 respectively. The internal carotid artery was patent in all patients (100%).
 
The conclusions of the CARENET trial were:
 

● | CARENET trial demonstrated safety of the CGuard EPS stent, with 30 day MACCE of 0%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Incidence of new ipsilateral lesions (percent of patients with new lesions on the ipsilateral side (same side where the stent was employed)) at 48 hours was reduced by almost half compared to published data, and volume was reduced almost tenfold. 
● | All but one lesion had resolved completely by 30 days. 
● | Twelve month data showed no change in peak systolic velocity between 6 months and 12 months, suggesting no restenosis concerns. 
● | CGuard EPS offers enhanced benefits for patients undergoing CAS with unprecedented safety. 

 
Physician-Sponsored Clinical Trials for CGuard—PARADIGM-101 Study
 
PARADIGM-101 (Prospective evaluation of All-comer peRcutaneous cArotiD revascularization In symptomatic and increased-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, using CGuard™ Mesh-covered embolic prevention stent system-101) was an investigator-led, single center study with the objective of evaluating feasibility and outcome of routine anti-embolic stent system in 101 consecutive unselected all-comer patients referred for carotid revascularization, initiated in 2015. In May 2016, the 30-day positive results were presented at the EuroPCR 2016 Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session in Paris, and in the Journal of EuroIntervention. In November 2016, positive twelve month follow-up data was presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) 2016 conference, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology at twelve months. In November 2017, preliminary 2 year follow-up results were presented at the 2017 VEITH Symposium in New York.
 
Key findings from the PARADIGM-101 study and the follow-up data are as follows:
 

● | CGuard EPS delivery success was 99.1%. The clinical evaluation also found no device foreshortening or elongation; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Angiographic diameter stenosis or vessel narrowing was reduced from 83±9% to only 6.7±5% (p<0.001); 
● | Periprocedural complications were 0%; 
● | One event was adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as a minor stroke (0.9%), with no change in NIH Stroke Scale or modified Ranking scale; 
● | At 12 months, no new adverse events (0%) were noted by independent neurologist evaluation; and 
● | At 24 months, preliminary results show no new adverse events (0%).

The results of the PARADIGM-101 study demonstrated that CGuard EPS can safely be used on a high risk, all-comer population of patients with carotid artery stenosis and indicate that routine use of CGuard EPS may prevent cerebral events, such as strokes, by holding plaque against the vessel wall, preventing emboli from being released into the blood stream. The PARADIGM-101 study found that CGuard EPS is applicable in up to 90% of all-comer patients with carotid stenosis.
 
Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study
 
Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study was an investigator-led, prospective single-center study which evaluated CGuard EPS in 30 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis disease with the objective of reporting early clinical outcomes with a novel double-layer stent for the internal carotid artery and the in vitro investigation of the stent’s mechanical properties. In October 2016, the 30-day positive results were published online-ahead-of-print in the Journal of Enovascular Therapy.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS without residual stenosis; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No peri- or post-procedural complications; 
● | No deaths, major adverse events, minor or major strokes, or new neurologic symptoms during the six months following the procedure; 
● | Modified Rankin Scale improved for the symptomatic patients from 1.56 prior to the procedure to 0 afterwards; 
● | All vessels treated with CGuard EPS remained patent (open) at six months; and 
● | DW-MRI performed in 19 of 30 patients found no new ipsilateral lesions after 30 days and after six months compared with the baseline DW-MRI studies. 

 
Additionally, based on engineering evaluations, the study concluded that CGuard EPS provides a high radial force and strong support in stenotic lesions. The stent is easy to use and safe to implant because it does not foreshorten and its structure adapts well to changes in diameter and direction of tortuous vascular anatomies. The MicroNet mesh of CGuard did not cause any changes to specific mechanical parameters of the underlying stent.
 
CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry
 
CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry using CGuard EPS was a physician initiated prospective multi-center registry that included 200 patients from 12 medical centers in Italy. The objective of the study was to report 30-day outcomes (including MACCE) in a prospective series of patients who received carotid artery stenting with CGuard EPS between April 2015 and June 2016. In January 2017, 30-day results were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) 2017.


Key 30-day results presented are as follows:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+---------------------------------------------
● | No MI, major stroke or death at 30 days;

Ongoing Investigator Initiated Independent Randomized Trial in Carotid Artery Revascularization Comparing the Stent (Acculink™) Versus CGuard EPS: Siberia Trial 
 
In October 2017, the first patients were enrolled and treated in an investigator initiated independent randomized trial in carotid artery revascularization. The objective of this ongoing trial is to assess the neuro protection and clinical superiority of the minimally invasive interventional procedure with the CGuard EPS as compared to Abbott’s RX ACCULINK Carotid Stent in subjects at high risk for carotid endarterectomy.


This trial is a single-center randomized trial with two interventional arms comparing CGuard™ EPS to Acculink. The trial is planned to enroll 100 consecutive eligible patients with 50 patients in each arm. The primary endpoint of the trial will be new ischemic areas in the brain within 24 to 48 hours post procedure and new lesion permanence at 30-days as determined by Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWMRI). Each patient will receive clinical and ultrasound follow-up at 1 year post procedure. The trial will be conducted at the Center of Vascular and Hybrid Surgery within the Scientific Research Institute of Circulation Pathology in Novosibirsk, Russia, which is associated with the Novosibirsk State University.
 
Completed Clinical Trials for MGuard Bare-Metal Coronary Products
 
We have completed eight clinical trials with respect to our first generation stainless steel-based MGuard stent and our cobalt-chromium based MGuard Prime EPS stent. Our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union in October 2007. We subsequently replaced the stainless steel stent with a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent for MGuard Prime EPS.
 
The First in Men (FIM) study conducted in Germany from the fourth quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2008 focused on patients with occlusion in their stent graft. This group is considered to be in “high risk” for complications during and shortly after the procedure due to the substantial risk of occurrence of a thromboembolic event. The study demonstrated MGuard stent’s safety in this high risk group. This study was followed by the GUARD study in Brazil in 2007 with a similar patient population which reinforced the safety profile of MGuard stents in patients prone to procedural complications. The MAGICAL study was a pilot study in STEMI patients conducted in Poland from 2008 through 2012 which demonstrated safety, measured by MACE rates at 30 days following the stent procedure, as well as efficacy results, measured by the ability of MGuard to reestablish blood flow into the infarcted area of the muscle. Furthermore, we conducted three registries (iMOS, IMR and iMOS Prime) that confirmed the feasibility of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of STEMI patients and the safety of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS in the STEMI patient group. Safety was repeatedly demonstrated in these trials and registries by the low mortality rate in the first month after the procedure.
 
In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MGuard for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial (which we refer to as our “MASTER I trial”), a prospective, randomized study, which demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI, patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution, or restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack, compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. The results of this trial are summarized in greater detail below.
 
Finally, the MASTER II trial, which we initially initiated as part of our efforts to seek approval of our MGuard Prime EPS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was discontinued at our election in its current form in light of market conditions moving toward the use of drug-eluting stents over bare-metal stents. Analysis of the patients already enrolled in the MASTER II trial prior to its suspension, however, reconfirmed the MASTER I safety results due to a continued low mortality rate.

MASTER I Trial
 
In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MASTER I trial, a prospective, randomized study in Europe, South America and Israel to compare the MGuard with commercially-approved bare metal and drug-eluting stents in achieving superior myocardial reperfusion (the restoration of blood flow) in primary angioplasty for the treatment of acute STEMI, the most severe form of heart attack. The MASTER I trial enrolled 433 subjects, 50% of whom were treated with MGuard and 50% of whom were treated with a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent. The detailed acute and 30 days results from the trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 24, 2012 and published (Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Evaluation of a Polyethylene Terephthalate Micronet Mesh–Covered Stent (MGuard) in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Stone et. Al, JACC, 60; 2012). The results were as follows:

● | The primary endpoint of post-procedure complete ST-segment resolution (restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack) was statistically significantly improved in patients randomized to the MGuard compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (57.8% vs. 44.7%). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patients receiving MGuard exhibited superior rates of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow, which evidences normal coronary blood flow that fills the distal coronary bed completely, as compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (91.7% vs. 82.9%), with comparable rates of myocardial blush grade 2 or 3 (83.9% vs. 84.7%) and corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) (17.0 vs. 18.1), all markers of optimal blood flow to the heart. 
● | Angiographic success rates (attainment of <50% final residual stenosis of the target lesion and final TIMI 3 flow) were higher in the MGuard group compared to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents (91.7% vs 82.4%). 
● | Mortality (0% vs. 1.9%) and major adverse cardiac events (1.8% vs. 2.3%) at 30 days post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to MGuard as opposed to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 

 
The six month results from the MASTER I trial were presented at the 2013 EuroPCR Meeting, the official annual meeting of the European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, on May 23, 2013 in Paris, France. The results were as follows:



● | Mortality (0.5% vs. 2.8%) and major adverse cardiac events (5.2% vs. 3.4%) at 6 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as compared to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between patients treated with MGuard and those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The twelve month results from the MASTER I trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 29, 2013 and published (Mesh-Covered Embolic Protection Stent Implantation in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Final 1-Year Clinical and Angiographic Results From the MGUARD for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial, Dudek e. el, Coronary Interventions, 2014). The results were as follows:



● | Mortality (1.0% vs. 3.3%) and major adverse cardiac events (9.1% vs. 3.3%) at 12 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as opposed to those randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac events, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents.

In summary, the MASTER I trial demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. In addition, patients treated with MGuard showed a slightly lower mortality rate and a slightly higher major adverse cardiac event rate as compared to patients treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents six and twelve months post procedure.
 
A detailed table with the results from the MASTER I trial is set forth below. The “p-Value” refers to the probability of obtaining a given test result. Any p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Future Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS 
 
Post-marketing clinical trials (outside the United States) could be conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CGuard EPS in specific indications. These trials would be designed to facilitate market acceptance and expand the use of the product. We expect to be able to rely upon CE mark approval of the product and other supporting clinical data to obtain local approvals.
 
We do not anticipate conducting additional post-marketing clinical trials for our bare-metal MGuard coronary products.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our primary business objective is to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology and products to become the industry standard for treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease and to provide a superior solution to the common acute problems caused by current stenting procedures, such as restenosis, embolic showers and late thrombosis. We are pursuing the following business strategies to achieve this objective.

● | Grow our presence in existing and new markets for CGuard EPS. We have launched CGuard EPS in most European and Latin American countries through a comprehensive distributor sales organizations network. We are also pursuing additional product registrations and distribution contracts with local distributors in other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to leverage our MicroNet technology to develop additional applications for interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons. In addition to the applications described above, we believe that we will eventually be able to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology to address imminent market needs for new product innovations to significantly improve patients’ care. We continue to broadly develop and protect intellectual property using our mesh technology. Examples of some areas include peripheral vascular disease, neurovascular disease, renal artery disease and bifurcation disease. 
● | Establish relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our existing and future products. We are seeking strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could assist with our development and commercialization efforts for CGuard EPS and NGuard, as well as future efforts with MGuard Prime EPS, MGuard DES, and other potential products that are based on our MicroNet technology.

--


● | Continue to protect and expand our portfolio of patents. Our MicroNet technology and the use of patents to protect it are critical to our success. We own numerous patents for our MicroNet technology. Seventeen patent applications have been filed (eight of which are now pending) in the United States, some of which have corresponding patent applications and/or issued patents in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, and South Africa. We believe these patents and patent applications collectively cover all of our existing products, and may be useful for protecting our future technological developments. We intend to aggressively continue patenting new technology, and to actively pursue any infringement covered by any of our patents. We believe that our patents, and patent applications once allowed, are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments.

● | Resume development and successfully commercialize MGuard DES. While we have limited the focus of product development to carotid and neurovascular products, if we resume development of our coronary products, we plan to evaluate opportunities to further develop MGuard DES. 

Competition 
 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change and impacted by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
 
Carotid
 
The carotid stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd. (currently part of Medtronic, Inc.), and Cordis Corporation (currently part of Cardinal Health, Inc.). Gore Medical and Terumo Medical Corporation produce a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh-covered stent and a double layer metal stent, respectively. All of these larger companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations and relationships with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution methods that are more effective than ours. However, we believe that the European market is somewhat fragmented, and, in our opinion, smaller competitors may be able to gain market share with greater flexibility.
Coronary
 
The bare-metal stent and the drug-eluting stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, and Medtronic, Inc. In the future, we believe that physicians will look to next-generation stent technology to compete with existing therapies. These new technologies will likely include bio-absorbable stents, stents that focus on treating bifurcated lesions, and stents with superior polymer and drug coatings, and many industry participants are working to improve stenting procedures in the future as the portfolio of available stent technologies rapidly increases.
 
According to the MEDTECH OUTLOOK, the three major players (Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation and Medtronic, Inc.) in the worldwide coronary stent market have a combined total market share of approximately 92%. To date, our sales are not significant enough to register in market share. As such, one of the challenges we face to further our product growth is the competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the therapeutics area, as well as competition from academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Most of our current and potential competitors, including but not limited to those listed above, have, and will continue to have, substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do. Due to ongoing consolidation in the industry, there are high barriers to entry for small manufacturers in both the European and the United States markets.
 
Neurovascular
 
Stryker Corporation dominated the global interventional neurology market in 2014. The other key players in this market include Medtronic plc, Johnson & Johnson, Terumo Corporation, Penumbra, Abbott Laboratories, Merit Medical Systems, Inc., W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Microport Scientific Corporation, and Medikit Co., Ltd., among others. (Source: Markets and Markets 2015).

Research and Development Expenses
 
During each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we spent $1.3 million, on research and development.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Currently, we are actively selling our MGuard coronary products with a bio-stable MicroNet through local distributors in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.
 
Based on the positive CGuard EPS clinical data, we initiated the commercial launch of CGuard EPS in CE marked countries in early 2015. In September 2015, we announced full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe.
 
In 2017, we decided to shift our commercial strategy to focus on sales of our products through local distribution partners and our own internal sales initiatives to gain greater reach into all the relevant clinical specialties and to expand our geographic coverage. Pursuant to our new strategy, we completed our transition away from a single distributor covering 18 European countries to a direct distribution model. Through our former distributor in Europe, CGuard EPS was largely sold to interventional neuroradiologists. Our current strategy is intended to broaden our sales efforts to other key clinical specialties that implant carotid stents, the vascular surgeons, interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists. All territories previously covered by our former European distributor have been transferred to local distributors by June 2017. We plan to focus our marketing efforts primarily on Europe, Asia Pacific region and Latin America, expanding our direct distribution model in those markets, especially in countries with current or near-term regulatory approval. In addition, we are using international trade shows and industry conferences to gain market exposure and brand recognition. We plan to work with leading physicians to enhance our marketing efforts.
 
Product Positioning 
 
The MGuard coronary products have initially penetrated the market by entering segments with indications that present high risks of embolic dislodgement, notably acute MI and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions. Even though MGuard technology has demonstrated its advantages with clinical data, it is based on a bare-metal platform while the market demand has shifted away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting stents.
 
When treating carotid artery disease, we believe that there is an opportunity to enter the market with bare-metal stent platform and to become a competitive player without a drug-eluting stent platform. Therefore, we believe that CGuard EPS is poised for commercial growth in 2018 as more and more positive clinical data is presented. If we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, we plan to develop CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge), which we intend to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds. Based on the level of interest in this product that we have observed in our clinical trials, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller profile delivery catheter will enable us to meet the market demand for minimally invasive devices, which, we believe, may have broader and easier usage, and for a lower profile system used in procedures in which predilation could be problematic. We also believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller profile delivery catheter will enable us to have a competitive advantage in penetrating the Asia Pacific market, since its population is generally smaller than in Western countries. In addition, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller profile delivery catheter will enable us to offer CGuard EPS for use in transradial catheterization, which, we believe, is gaining favor among interventionalists. Finally, we do not expect that it would be crucial to use a drug-eluting stent platform to compete in certain new markets such as the neurovascular market, and hence, we plan to continue to explore this area of opportunity.
 
Insurance Reimbursement 
 
In most countries, a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses is covered by third-party payers. Third-party payers can include both government funded insurance programs and private insurance programs. While each payer develops and maintains its own coverage and reimbursement policies, the vast majority of payers have similarly established policies. The MGuard coronary product and CGuard product sold to date have been designed and labeled in such a way as to facilitate the utilization of existing reimbursement codes, and we intend to continue to design and label our present and future products in a manner consistent with this goal.
 
While most countries have established reimbursement codes for stenting procedures, certain countries may require additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for the MGuard coronary products and CGuard products or in order to obtain a higher reimbursement price. In these situations, we intend to complete the required clinical studies to obtain reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.

Patents
 
We have twenty-seven pending patent applications, ten of which are pending in the United States, many of which cover aspects of our MGuard and CGuard technology. Some of the corresponding patent applications outside the U.S. are filed in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India and South Africa. We hold an aggregate total of over 65 patents and pending applications including eight issued U.S. patents. These patent rights are directed to cover the following eight (8) patent families:

In lay terms, these patent applications generally cover three aspects of our products: the mesh sleeve with and without a drug, the product and the delivery mechanism of the stent. We also believe that one or more additional pending patent applications, upon issuance, will cover our existing products. We also believe that the patent applications we have filed, in particular those covering the use of a knitted micron-level mesh sleeve over a stent for various indications, if issued as patents with claims substantially in their present form, would likely create a significant barrier for another company seeking to use similar technology.

Government Regulation
 
The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the European Union CE mark and other corresponding foreign agencies.
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex approval process, clinical trials and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration market authorization. These differences may affect the timeliness of international market introduction of our products. For the European Union nations, medical devices must obtain a CE mark before they may be placed on the market. In order to obtain and maintain the CE mark, we must comply with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC by presenting comprehensive technical files for our products demonstrating safety and efficacy of the product to be placed on the market and passing initial and annual quality management system audit as per ISO 13485 standard by an European Notified Body. We have obtained ISO 13485 quality system certification and the products we currently distribute into the European Union display the required CE mark. In order to maintain certification, we are required to pass an annual surveillance audit conducted by Notified Body auditors.
 
As noted below, we have regulatory approval and have made sales of MGuard Prime EPS, CGuard EPS or both products either through distributors pursuant to distribution agreements or directly, in the following countries: Argentina, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We have temporary regulatory approval to sell MGuard Prime EPS in Malaysia while we are in the registration process due to a regulatory change in November 2015. In addition, we are awaiting regulatory approval to sell our products in Ecuador, Peru, Australia, Mexico, Serbia, Turkey, Taiwan and Vietnam (for CGuard EPS). While each of the European Union member countries accepts the CE mark as its sole requirement for marketing approval, some of these countries still require us to take additional steps in order to gain reimbursement rights for our products. Furthermore, while we believe that certain of the above-listed countries that are not members of the European Union accept the CE mark as a primary requirement for marketing approval, each such country requires additional regulatory requirements for final marketing approval of our products. Furthermore, we are currently targeting additional countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, however, even if all governmental regulatory requirements are satisfied in each such country, we anticipate that obtaining marketing approval in each country could take as few as three months or as many as twelve months or more, due to the nature of the approval process in each individual country, including typical wait times for application processing and review, as discussed in greater detail below.
 
In October 2007, our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union. We subsequently replaced the first generation MGuard product with MGuard Prime EPS, which uses a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent. Our MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 and marketing approval in those countries listed in the table below.

(1) | We have lost our approval due to administrative issues but are now in the process of renewing the approval. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | The Australia Regulatory Authority (TGA) allows patients to receive treatment with unapproved device via a compassionate route. 
(3) | We have made sales to distributors in this country, but based upon information from such distributors, we believe that the product has not been sold to customers in this country. 
(4) | Due to the changes made to the relevant regulations in Malaysia that became effective in November 2015, we are required to register our product. On November 29, 2015, we initiated the registration process required pursuant to the amended regulation. We have temporary authorization to sell and market MGuard Prime EPS in Malaysia pending a final determination of our application for registration which, we expect to receive around January 2019. 
(5) | We believe that we have regulatory approval for MGuard Prime EPS in South Africa based upon information from our former distributor in such country, who was responsible for obtaining the regulatory approval for MGuard Prime EPS. However, the certificate evidencing regulatory approval was held by our former distributor and we cannot guarantee that it is in full force and effect. Our distribution agreement with the distributor in South Africa expired pursuant to the terms of such distribution agreement on February 1, 2015. 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Government Regulation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
 
Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of medical devices.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a premarket approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are “approved” to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. We anticipate filing a premarket approval application in the future and do not anticipate filing a 510(k) premarket notification. Even though we do not anticipate filing a 510(k), we cannot be certain that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will find it more appropriate for us to file a 510(k) premarket notification instead of a premarket approval application. Further, we cannot be sure that we will ever obtain a premarket approval. Descriptions of the premarket approval and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. Premarket approval is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses these criteria to decide whether a premarket approval or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet called for submission of a premarket approval application.
 
Device classification depends on many factors including the device’s intended use and its indications for use. In addition, classification is risk-based, that is, the risk the device poses to the patient and/or the user is a major factor in determining the class to which it is assigned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through the 510(k) process described below.
 
Class II devices are subject to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), as of October 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.
 
Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot generally be marketed until they receive a premarket approval. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under MDFUMA, premarket approval applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.
 
Premarket Approval Pathway
 
A premarket approval application must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A premarket approval application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a premarket approval application is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an IDE. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to human health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.
 
The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board (IRB) approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements.
 
A clinical trial may be suspended by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a premarket approval application.
 
After a premarket approval application is sufficiently complete, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality Systems Regulations, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved premarket approval require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
We do not currently market, distribute, or sell any products that have market clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under its 510(k) process. If, in the future, we develop products where 510(k) clearance is required, we would be required to submit a 510(k) demonstrating that such proposed devices are substantially equivalent to a respective previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet called for the submission of 510(k). U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 
If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a premarket approval. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a premarket approval, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration disagrees with a manufacturer's determination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of the modified device is obtained.
 
Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our approved devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Device Reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. Class II devices also can have special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines that do not apply to Class I devices.
 
A noncomprehensive list of the regulatory requirements that apply to our approved products classified as medical devices include:
 

● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections and other regulatory action; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality Systems Regulations, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process; 
● | labeling regulations and U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
● | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
● | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our cleared devices; 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; 
● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
● | the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
● | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and, 
● | notices of corrections or removals. 



We do not currently have a registered establishment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If we are approved or cleared to manufacture, prepare, or process a device in the United States, we and any third-party manufacturers that we may use must will be required to register our establishments with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, we and our manufacturing facilities will be subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections for compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Quality System Regulation. Additionally, some of our subcontractors may also be subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced and unannounced inspections for compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Quality System Regulation. These regulations will require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and quality control activities. As a medical device manufacturer, we will further be required to comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations also govern product labeling and prohibit a manufacturer from marketing a medical device for unapproved applications.
 
We anticipate that our CGuard EPS will be classified as a Class III medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Class III medical devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory control by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration process of premarket approval involves scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices for the purpose(s) intended. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will either approve or deny a premarket approval application and we cannot market a device unless or until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves a premarket approval application.
 
We expect the approval process in the U.S. to take a significant amount of time, require the expenditure of significant resources, involve rigorous clinical investigations and testing, and potentially require changes to products. The approval process may result in limitations on the indicated uses of the medical devices for which we are able to obtain approval (since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can take action against a company that promotes off-label uses) and will also require increased post-market surveillance.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration actively monitors compliance with laws and regulations through its review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices (that is, medical devices that do not comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including as implemented through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations); order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other amending laws pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products, may limit our ability to obtain premarket approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.
 
U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
In addition to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, there are a variety of other healthcare laws and regulations to which we are subject once are products are marketed, sold, distributed, and/or utilized in the United States. Of specific note are federal and state fraud and abuse laws which prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of health care products and services. Other provisions of federal and state laws prohibit presenting, or causing to be presented, to third party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, other health care laws and regulations may apply, such as transparency and reporting requirements, and privacy and security requirements. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. The health care laws that may be applicable to our business or operations include:



● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for, or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal health care program. Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, and for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations and requirements on health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform certain services for them that involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, with respect to safeguarding the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information. 
● | The federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
● | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to referrals and items or services reimbursed by both governmental and non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal law, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Customers
 
Our customer base is varied. We began shipping our product to customers in Europe in January 2008 and have since expanded our global distribution network to Southeast Asia, India, Latin America and Israel. We currently have distribution agreements for our CE mark-approved MGuard Prime EPS and/or CGuard EPS with medical product distributors based in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We are currently in discussions with additional distribution companies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

Our agreement with Natec Medical Ltd., as amended, may be terminated by us upon eight months’ notice. On August 1, 2017, we amended the agreement with Natec Medical Ltd., so that we are responsible for purchasing and handling inventory of CGuard EPS delivery system, and Natec Medical Ltd.is responsible for the manufacturing process.
 
Natec Medical Ltd. supplies us with catheters that help create the base for our MGuard Prime EPS. Our agreement with Natec Medical Ltd., which may be terminated by either party upon six months’ notice, calls for non-binding minimum orders.
 
The cobalt-chromium stent for our MGuard Prime EPS was designed by Svelte Medical Systems Inc. We have an agreement with Svelte Medical Systems Inc., as amended, that grants us a non-exclusive, worldwide license for production and use of the MGuard Prime cobalt-chromium stent for the life of the stent’s patent, subject to the earlier termination of the agreement upon the bankruptcy of either party or the uncured default by either party under any material provision of the agreement. Our royalty payments to Svelte Medical Systems Inc. are determined by the sales volume of MGuard Prime EPS. Currently, the royalty rate is 2.9% of all net sales.


We manufacture our CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS at our own facility. The bare-metal cobalt-chromium stents for our MGuard Prime EPS and the self-expanding bare-metal stents for our CGuard EPS are being manufactured and supplied by MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung. Our agreement with MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung for the production of electro polished L605 bare-metal stents for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS is priced on a per-stent basis, subject to the quantity of stents ordered. The complete assembly process for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS, including knitting and securing the sleeve to the stent and the crimping of the sleeve stent on to a delivery catheter, is done at our Israel manufacturing site. Once MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS have been assembled, they are sent for sterilization in Germany, and then back to Israel for final packaging and distribution.
 
Each MGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, the stent and the mesh polymer. The stent is made out of cobalt chromium. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to insure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.
 
A CGuard EPS consists of a CGuard stent and the delivery system. Each CGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, a self-expending nickel-titanium stent and the mesh polymer. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). We have pending patent rights that cover the proposed CGuard stent with mesh. This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. The delivery system for CGuard is made out of polymer tubes we acquire from an original equipment manufacturer. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to insure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.
 
Employees 
 
As of February 12, 2018, we had 36 full-time employees. Except for one of our employees in Europe, our employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We do not expect the collective bargaining agreements to which our employees are party to have a material effect on our business or results of operations. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
