Item 1. Business
General
 
SmartHeat Inc., formerly known as Pacific Goldrim Resources, Inc. (the “Company” or “SmartHeat”), was incorporated on August 4, 2006, in the State of Nevada and at that time had little or no operations. On April 14, 2008 we changed our name to SmartHeat Inc. and acquired all of the equity interests in Taiyu, at that time a leading developer of plate heat exchangers (“PHEs”) and PHE Units in China.  Taiyu was formed in July 2002 under the laws of China and is headquartered in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China.  The Company, through its operating subsidiaries in China and Germany, formerly designed, manufactured, sold PHEs , PHE Units, temperature sensors, valves and automated control systems, heat meters and heat pumps for use in commercial and residential buildings until the sale of certain of its subsidiaries effective December 31, 2014.  From that time until the year ended 2016, we have primarily been engaged in the design and manufacturing of heat pumps for commercial applications through our principal operating subsidiary SmartHeat (Shenyang) Heat Pump Technology Co., Ltd.  (“SmartHeat Pump”). At that time the subsidiaries of SmartHeat Pump in China began the process of seeking bankruptcy protection and it primary operations became making arrangements with the Chinese government for the orderly winding down and liquidation of the business.
 
We have made the determination that our heat pump business cannot continue without incurring significant losses. As a result, our subsidiary SmartHeat Pump filed for bankruptcy protection with the relevant authorities in the PRC.  Prior to making such filing, SmartHeat Pump is required to make provisions to make payments to its employees and satisfy certain warranty requirements.  SmartHeat Pump’s business operations consist primarily of the foregoing activities, collecting receivables and selling inventory. 
 
We are still servicing existing customers who have purchased our plated heat exchanges “PHE”s through our subsidiary Heat PHE and are selling existing inventory and raw materials. We are in the process of winding down this business segment as well.
 
We are not actively selling new products or seeking new customers.
 
We are currently seeking potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, in a business combination, by reorganization, merger or acquisition.   Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence operations through funding and/or the acquisition or business combination with a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected.  We are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor, and we will be unable to do so until we determine any particular industry in which we may conduct business operations.
 
We are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except the search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition.  We are evaluating our status each quarter to determine if we are a “shell company.”   We do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any business or industry, and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities may include all lawful businesses.  We recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us will be extremely limited, and may be restricted to businesses or entities that desire to become a publicly-held company.
 Any of these types of business combination transactions, regardless of the particular prospect, would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could amount to as much as 95% or more of our outstanding voting securities; accordingly, investments in the private enterprise, if available, would be much more favorable than any investment in us.

Management intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any decision to participate in any specific business endeavor, none of which may be determinative or provide any assurance of success.  These may include, but will not be limited to, as applicable, an analysis of the quality of the particular business or entity’s management and personnel; the anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts that any such business or company may have; the merits of any such business’ or company’s technology or intellectual property; the present financial condition, projected growth potential and available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital, history of operations and future prospects; the nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of any such business’ or company’s management services and the depth of management; the business’ or the company’s potential for further research, development or exploration; risk factors specifically related to the business’ or company’s operations; the potential for growth, expansion and profit; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products, or services offered and trademarks and name identification; and numerous other factors that are difficult, if not impossible, to properly or accurately quantify or analyze, let alone describe or identify, without referring to specific objective criteria of an identified business or company.
 
Regardless, the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future, by reason of changing market strategies, plant or product expansion, changes in product emphasis, future management personnel and changes in innumerable other factors.  Further, in the case of a new business venture or one that is in a research and development mode, the risks will be substantial, and there will be no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business objectives.  Also, a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established, and with no past track record, the profitability of any such business will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty.
 
Our management will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel of any entity providing a potential business opportunity for us, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of information provided and gathered, check references of material personnel and conduct other reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably thorough review of any particular business opportunity; however, due to time constraints of management and limited capital, these activities may be limited. 
 
We are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may participate in any specific business endeavor or if at all.  We anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers in securities, venture capital personnel and others who may present unsolicited proposals.  In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate. Such persons may include our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their affiliates. In this event, such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential venture and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.  Management does not presently intend to acquire an interest in any business enterprise in which any member has an ownership interest.
 
Our History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 4, 2006, under the name Pacific Goldrim Resources, Inc., as an exploration stage corporation with minimal operations, to engage in the exploration for silver, lead and zinc. On April 14, 2008, we changed our name to SmartHeat Inc. and entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), to acquire Shenyang Taiyu Machinery & Electronic Equipment Co., Ltd., subsequently renamed SmartHeat Taiyu (Shenyang) Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (“Taiyu”), a privately held Sino-foreign joint venture company formed under the laws of the PRC on July 24, 2002, and engaged in the design, manufacture, sale and service of PHE products in China. The Share Exchange Agreement was entered into by SmartHeat, Taiyu and the shareholders of Taiyu. At the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, all of the equitable and legal rights, title and interests in and to Taiyu’s share capital of Yuan 25,000,000 were exchanged for 1,850,000 shares of SmartHeat common stock (the “Share Exchange”). We received PRC government approval on May 28, 2008, of our subscription for 71.6% of the registered capital of Taiyu, and approval on June 3, 2009, of the transfer of the remaining 28.4% ownership of Taiyu from the original joint venture shareholders who had received shares of our common stock in the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange and subsequent transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, and receipt of the above PRC government approvals, Taiyu became our wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE.
 
Prior to our acquisition of Taiyu, we had no interest in any property, but had the right to conduct exploration activities on 13 mineral title cells covering 27,027 hectares (66,785 acres) in the Slocan Mining Division of southeastern British Columbia, Canada. In connection with the acquisition of Taiyu, we transferred all of our pre-closing assets and liabilities (other than the obligation to pay a $10,000 fee to our audit firm) to a wholly owned subsidiary, PGR Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“SplitCo”), under the terms of an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations dated April 14, 2008. We sold all of the outstanding capital stock of SplitCo to Jason Schlombs, our former director and officer and one of our major shareholders, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 14, 2008, in exchange for the return of his 250,000 shares of our common stock to us for cancellation.

As an expansion of our business following our acquisition of Taiyu, we acquired and established strategic subsidiaries in China and Germany. On September 25, 2008, we acquired SanDeKe Co., Ltd., or SanDeKe, a Shanghai-based manufacturer of PHEs. On June 16, 2009, we completed an asset purchase transaction with Siping Beifang Heat Exchanger Manufacture Co., Ltd., or Siping Beifang, to set up a new manufacturing facility under our newly incorporated subsidiary, SmartHeat Siping Beifang Energy Technology Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Siping. On August 14, 2009, we formed Beijing SmartHeat Jinhui Energy Technology Co., Ltd., or Jinhui, a joint venture in Beijing of which we own 52%, to provide consulting services and expand our sales of PHEs into new industries and regions of China. On April 7, 2010, we formed SmartHeat (China) Investment Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Investment, as an investment holding company in Shenyang for our investment in and establishment of new companies and businesses in China. On April 12, 2010, SmartHeat Investment formed SmartHeat (Shenyang) Energy Equipment Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Energy, as its wholly owned subsidiary for the research, development, manufacturing and sales of energy products. On May 6, 2010, we formed SmartHeat (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Trading, through a nominee, Cleantech Holdings Inc., a British Virgin Islands company, or Cleantech Holdings, to market and expand sales of our branded products in China. Effective as of November 9, 2011, we terminated the nominee-owner relationship and acquired direct control over SmartHeat Trading. On December 2, 2010, we formed Hohhot Ruicheng Technology Co., Ltd., or Ruicheng, a joint venture in Hohhot City, China, for the design and manufacture of heat meters, of which we acquired 51% of the equity interest on January 7, 2011. On March 1, 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire 95% of the equity interests in Shenyang Bingchuan Refrigerating Machine Limited Company, a Shenyang-based state-owned heat pump manufacturer and designer subsequently renamed SmartHeat (Shenyang) Heat Pump Technology Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Pump. On November 1, 2011, we increased the registered capital of SmartHeat Pump and thereby increased our ownership percentage to 98.8%. On March 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Gustrower Warmepumpen GmbH, subsequently renamed SmartHeat Deutschland GmbH, or SmartHeat Germany, a designer and manufacturer of high efficiency heat pumps in Germany, to extend our clean technology heating solutions into the rapidly growing heat pump markets in Europe and China. We subsequently transferred ownership of SmartHeat Germany to SmartHeat Pump. On April 10, 2012, we established a new joint venture named Urumchi XinRui Technology Limited Liability Company (“XinRui”), of which we own 46%
 
On December 30, 2013, SmartHeat closed a transaction contemplated by an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2013, whereby the buyers purchased 40% of the equity interests in Taiyu, SmartHeat Siping, SmartHeat Energy, Ruicheng and XinRui. The purchase price was RMB 5,000,000.
 
On November 28, 2014, Heat PHE entered into an Amended Equity Interest Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Amended EIPA Buyers agreed to purchase the remaining 60% of Target Companies (constituting all of our remaining equity interests in the companies being sold). The purchase price for the remaining 60% consists of: (i) consideration of RMB 8,500,000 and (ii) the forgiveness of all net indebtedness owing to the companies being sold by SmartHeat and each of its other subsidiaries which was $8.79 million as of December 31, 2014.
 
The effectiveness of the transaction was subject to the following conditions: (i) approval of its shareholders and (ii) receipt by the Board of Directors (“BOD” or the “Board”) of the Company of an opinion that the purchase and sale transaction was fair to the shareholders of SmartHeat from a financial point of view. The parties executed a mutual release to be delivered at the closing which provided, in part, for the target companies to forgive all net indebtedness of $11.75 million from SmartHeat and all of its other subsidiaries. In the event that the conditions were not met prior to December 31, 2014, the consideration and all documents were to be deposited into escrow and released when the conditions were satisfied; provided that if the conditions were not satisfied on or before March 31, 2015, either party was able to terminate the Amended EIPA and the funds and documents were to be returned to the depositing party. The termination deadline of the Amended EIPA was extended to May 15, 2015.
 
On May 11, 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved the sale of all of the remaining interests, constituting 100% of its ownership interests, (the “Stock Sale”) of certain subsidiaries of the Company as described above, all of the conditions precedents to the Stock Sale were satisfied. The parties executed a mutual release which became effective and provided, in part, that the Target Companies forgave all net indebtedness from SmartHeat and all of its other subsidiaries owed to the Target Companies. The consideration and all documents relating to the transaction were released from escrow upon the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions.
 
On January 20, 2016, the Company entered a Share Purchase Agreement with a series of buyers to sell 85% of the equity shares of SmartHeat Deutschland GmbH (“SmartHeat Germany”) for Euro 170,000 ($185,400).  SmartHeat Germany was treated as a discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

In October of 2017, The Company entered into negotiations with Northtech Holdings Inc., a British Virgin Islands business corporation (“Northtech”) in order to restructure the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement dated July 27, 2012, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”). On October 31, 2017 the Credit Line was not extended, and the parties continued negotiations.  The parties have agreed that Northtech will convert all outstanding interest and principal due under the Credit Agreement into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $.065 per share, which represents a premium of $0649 to the thirty-day average closing price of the Company's common stock of $.0001 per share.  In addition, the parties agreed to reduce the maximum credit line under the Credit Agreement to $1,000,000 and extended the maturity date to December 31, 2018. Further conversion of any outstanding principal and interest under the Credit Agreement will be based on conversion price subject to a minimum of $.065 per share and a maximum of $.50 per share.
 
On June 14, 2018, we entered into the Sixth Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement with Northtech on the terms set forth above. The Amendment is required to receive the approval of a majority of shareholders of the Company in a vote to be held at the next meeting of the stockholders. In the event approval is not received, it will be considered an event of default under the Credit Agreement.
 
Our Business Segments
 
On August 23, 2013, the Company formed two new wholly-owned subsidiaries in the state of Nevada, Heat HP, Inc.(“Heat HP”) and Heat PHE, Inc. (“Heat PHE”), in order to reorganize the Company’s ownership structure over its subsidiaries. On August 23, 2013, the Company entered into an assignment agreement (“Assignment Agreement”) with each of Heat HP and Heat PHE which effected the reorganization.  The reorganization was performed so the Company’s subsidiaries would be organized along their respective operating segments with Heat HP holding those subsidiaries that operated in the heat pumps and related products segment and Heat PHE holding those subsidiaries that operated in the plate heating equipment, meters and related products segment.  The Company initially presented its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, in accordance with these operating segments and has continued segment reporting since that time.
 
Under the Assignment Agreement with Heat HP, the Company agreed to transfer, and in the case of indirectly owned subsidiaries, caused to be transferred, to Heat HP the following subsidiaries of the Company:
 

Heat HP 
----------------------------------------------------
SmartHeat (China) Investment Co., Ltd.

The effectiveness of the transaction was subject to the following conditions: (i) approval of its stockholders and (ii) receipt by the Board of Directors of the Company of an opinion that the sale was fair to the stockholders of SmartHeat from a financial point of view. The parties executed a mutual release, effective as of the Closing, which will provided, in part, for the companies being sold to forgive all net indebtedness from SmartHeat and all of its other subsidiaries owing to such companies as of the effective date of the Closing. On December 24, 2014, the consideration and all documents were deposited into escrow and were released upon satisfaction of the conditions.

The consideration and all documents relating to the transaction were released from escrow upon the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions.
 
The buyers consisted of 25 natural PRC citizens, including Wen Sha, Jun Wang and Xudong Wang, managers of the Company’s subsidiaries engaged in the PHE segment of its business, and Huajuan Ai and Yingkai Wang, the Company’s Corporate Secretary and Acting Chief Accountant, respectively.  Huajuan Ai, Wen Sha, Jun Wang and Xudong Wang are also principals in Northtech Holdings Inc., the company that provided a credit line of $2.5 million to the Company.
 
Competitive Business Conditions and Our Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
 
Management believes that there are hundreds of shell companies engaged in endeavors similar to our new business plan; however, there are very few non-shell companies such as ours which have the same business plan. Competitors also include other publicly-held companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful, and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse reorganization or merger.  There is no reasonable way to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in these endeavors.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
None; not applicable.
 
Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
Because we currently have no business operations other than reduction of inventory, produce no products nor provide any significant services, we are not presently subject to any governmental regulation other than has previously been received in this regard.  Our subsidiary SmartHeat Pump will be subject to the rules applicable to companies seeking bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation in the PRC. If we complete a business combination transaction, we will become subject to all governmental approval requirements to which the reorganized, merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on our Business
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the SEC and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations:
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.”  That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K applicable to larger companies
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes/Oxley Act of 2002.  The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthen auditor independence.  It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation to management’s conclusions about internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.

Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to stockholders at special or annual meetings thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.
 
We are also required to file Annual Reports on SEC Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on SEC Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on SEC Form 8-K.
 
Laws of the Peoples Republic of China
 
Our subsidiaries located in China are subject to national, provincial and local laws of the Peoples Republic of China. The legal system in China is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents. In 1979, China began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic and commercial matters, but these recently enacted laws and regulations may not cover all aspects of business activities in China sufficiently. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to our subsidiaries. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, there may be certain instances when we may not be aware of our subsidiaries violation of these policies and rules until sometime after such violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
The PRC government has enacted some laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. Our subsidiaries’ ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes under these laws and regulations is unpredictable, however, because the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations is limited and, given their relative newness, involve uncertainties. For example, contracts governed by PRC law tend to contain less detail than those under U.S. law and generally are not as comprehensive in defining the rights and obligations of the contracting parties. Consequently, contracts in China are more vulnerable to disputes and legal challenges than those in the U.S. In addition, contract interpretation and enforcement in China is not as developed as in the U.S., and the result of any contract dispute is subject to significant uncertainties. Our subsidiaries currently are not subject to any contract dispute, but we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will not be subject to future contract disputes with our suppliers, franchisees and other customers under contracts governed by PRC law, and if such disputes arise, we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will prevail.
 
The RMB is currently convertible under the “current account,” which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the “capital account,” which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our subsidiaries in China may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the SAFE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate their ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenues will be denominated in RMB, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenues generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in for
 
On August 29, 2008, the SAFE promulgated Circular 142, the Notice on Perfecting Practices Concerning Foreign Exchange Settlement Regarding the Capital Contribution by Foreign-invested Enterprises, to regulate the conversion by foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless specifically provided for otherwise. In addition, the SAFE strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of RMB funds converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE. The use of such RMB may not be changed without approval from the SAFE, and may not be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. These limitations could affect the ability of our subsidiaries in China to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.

On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Regulations, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The M&A Regulations, among other things, have certain provisions that require offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. We believe, based on the opinion of our PRC legal counsel, the Beijing Rondos Law Firm, that while the CSRC generally has jurisdiction over overseas listings of SPVs like us, CSRC’s approval is not required for the offerings of our securities because our current corporate structure was established before the new regulation became effective. However, there remains some uncertainty as to how this regulation will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that its approval is required for our public offerings, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency. If this happens, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our public offerings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 
On June 29, 2007, the PRC government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, effective on January 1, 2008, to govern the establishment of employment relationships between employers and employees, and the conclusion, performance, termination of and the amendment to employment contracts. The Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly affects the cost of an employer’s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires that certain terminations be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event our subsidiaries decide to significantly change or decrease their workforce in China, the Labor Contract Law could adversely affect their ability to effect such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our current business operations are not subject to any material environmental laws, rules or regulations that would have an adverse material effect on our business operations or financial condition or result in a material compliance cost; however, our former business conducted through our subsidiaries was subject to the environmental laws of the PRC and provincial and local governments. We will become subject to all governmental requirements to which the reorganized, merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject, on the closing of a business combination.
