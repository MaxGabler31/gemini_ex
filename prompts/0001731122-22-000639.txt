Company Overview
 
Splash is a portfolio company managing multiple brands across several growth segments within the consumer beverage industry. Splash has built organizational capabilities and an infrastructure enabling it to incubate and/or acquire brands with the intention of efficiently accelerating them to higher volumes. We have proven capabilities in building consumer franchises and marketing and distributing multiple brands of beverages within the non-alcoholic and alcoholic segments. Manufacturing is typically outsourced to third party co-packers and distillers, or in select cases for a brand such as Copa Di Vino wines, performed within our own facility in Oregon.
 
We believe the distribution landscape in the beverage industry is changing rapidly as tech-enabled e-commerce business models are thriving. Direct to consumer, office or home solutions are projected to continue to gain traction in the future. To address this opportunity Splash continues to shape its operating model to be vertically integrated building a proprietary e-commerce platform, Qplash, which allows us to purchase local and regional brands for developing a direct line of sales at retail stores.
 
Splash Beverage Group II, Inc. Splash’s wholly owned subsidiary, was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name TapouT Beverages, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring the rights under a license agreement with TapouT, LLC (Authentic Brands Group ) for the right to use the TapouT Performance brand in connection with manufacturing and selling certain beverages. In 2014, Robert Nistico was hired as Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s name was changed to Splash Beverage Group, Inc. to reflect the revised business plan of being a manufacturer and distributor of several brands of beverages including both non-alcoholic and alcoholic brands.

Robert Nistico has over 28 years of experience in all levels of the three-tier distribution system used in the beverage industry. Prior to joining the Company, he led the Marley Beverage Company from startup to over $47 million in annual revenues and ultimately profitability in three and one-half years. Before that he was the 5th employee at Red Bull North America, Inc. and served as General Manager, VP of Field Marketing and Sr. Vice President & General Manager during his 11 years there. He was instrumental in building the Red Bull brand in North and Central America and the Caribbean. Under his leadership, revenues grew from $0 revenue to over $1.6 billion annually. Nistico began his career with the Gallo Winery, quickly ascending within that system between winery and senior positions in distribution with Premier Beverage and RNDC Texas.
 
Mr. Nistico has assembled a team of experienced beverage industry professionals including SBG’s President & CMO, Bill Meissner, the former CEO and/or President of brands such as Sparkling Ice, Fuse and Jones Soda with the goal of replicating the business model of companies like Diageo of owning certain brands and managing others where there are synergies from a distribution standpoint. SBG however, has an additional strategic advantage of “brand incubation” with its own ecommerce platform.
 
Splash has license rights to the TapouT Performance brand globally and has a joint venture with SALT Naturally Flavored Tequila, and Copa Di Vino wines & Pulpoloco sangrias, SBG’s first acquisition. Mr. Nistico and Company leadership understand the importance of infusing beverage brands with strong pop culture and lifestyle elements which drives trial, belief and, most importantly, repeat purchases.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to combine the traditional approach of manufacturing, distributing, and marketing of beverages, with brands that have a reasonable level of pre-existing brand awareness and market presence, or have attributes that we believe to be purely innovative. We believe this allows us to break through the clutter of numerous brand introductions and dilute risk. This philosophy is applied regardless of whether the brand is 100% owned by us or a joint venture.
 
For acquisition or joint venture consideration, we prefer to work with brands that already have one or more of the following in place:
 

● | Some level of preexisting brand awareness
--+------------------------------------------


● | Regional presence that can be expanded
--+---------------------------------------


● | Licensing an existing brand name (TapouT for example)
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Add to an underdeveloped and/or growing category capitalizing on consumer trends 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovation to an existing attractive category (such as flavored tequila)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe this model provides us with two paths to success: one, developing our wholly owned core brands and two, the ability to tap into high growth, early-stage brands ready to scale. This platform allows us to significantly reduce development expense while simultaneously increasing efficiencies for all brands in our portfolio.
 
Most new single beverage brands have limited access to distribution and thus find it extremely difficult to obtain meaningful retail shelf presence. Our management team has over 120 years of combined experience in the beverage industry, including decades of successful brand introductions by our management team (Gallo, Red Bull, Bacardi, Diageo, Sparkling Ice, Jones Soda, FUZE Beverage, NOS Energy, SoBe Beverages, Muscle Milk, Marley Beverages), we believe our ability to break through the distribution and retail bottlenecks makes us an attractive joint venture partner to many new brand owners.
 
Our preference is to own and control all aspects of any given brand. However, we have also been flexible to engage in business ventures structured with a revenue split, a marketing spend commitment from the brand founder and an earned equity position that constitutes control. We have proven that many partners are happy to award Splash an equity position in their brand in exchange for distribution, sales and marketing management within the distribution network which eliminates their need to invest in infrastructure. Our partners only need to manage a small base of corporate operations.
 
The benefit to Splash in these shared brand ownerships is the ability to avoid the development costs for new products. This model spreads our risk over several brands, contributes to our economies of scale, and improves our relationship with distributors because we can provide them with a broader line of beverage products.
 
Since our inception, we have seen consistent deal flow, having been approached by over 20 brands. We only engage with brands that fit comfortably within the guidelines noted above and which provide efficiencies or synergies within the beverage categories and retail channels we participate in.
 
We also believe the distribution landscape in the beverage category is changing rapidly. Tech-enabled business models are thriving and direct to consumer, office or home solutions are projected to continue to gain traction as beverage alcohol regulations evolve. A core strategy for us is to build onto the early success we’re seeing with the Qplash online platform, our consumer-packaged goods retail division and our first entry point into the growing e-commerce channel.
 
Products
 
We currently produce, distribute and market SALT Naturally Flavored Tequila (“SALT”), a 100% agave 80 proof line of flavored tequilas, “TapouT Performance,” a hydration and recovery isotonic sport drink, Copa Di Vino single serve wine by the glass and import Pulpoloco Sangria in 3 flavors.

The following is a description of these products.
 
SALT Flavored Tequila
 

We produce, distribute, and market the following flavors under the brand name SALT Naturally Flavored Tequila:
 

● | Citrus flavor
--+--------------


● | Berry flavor

We believe that SALT is the first line of 100% agave 80-proof flavored tequilas. Vodka, rum, and brown spirits have experienced significant growth when flavors are introduced, and we expect this growth of flavors to continue, as the tequila category continues to rapidly expand.
 
SALT is currently being distributed by Republic National Distribution Co., Youngs Market, various Anheuser-Busch & Miller-Coors distributorships, and Major Brands Distribution Company, a wine and spirits distributor in the Mid-West to chains such as Walmart and Total Wine (which is the largest private wine and spirits chain in the U.S.), and others in multiple U.S. states. Additionally, SALT is for sale in Mexico. Several South American countries are expected to launch SALT during spring 2022.
 
SALT is a business venture between our Company and SALT USA, LLC. All aspects of manufacturing, logistics, distribution and marketing are our responsibility.

If the annual revenue is not equal to at least 80% of projected revenue, the applicable revenue percentage for all subsequent payments will automatically increase by 0.50%, without notice from the lender. Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 24, 2020, the Company instructed the Lender to pay $1,500,000 of the Gross Amount under the Credit Facility towards the purchase price in connection with the Company’s purchase of certain assets of Copa di Vino Corporation (“CdV”) and the balance of the Gross Amount was used for to pay off a line of credit for one of the Company’s other subsidiaries in order to make the Lender the first-in-line creditor.

Copa di Vino is the leading producer of premium wine by the glass in the United States. Founder James Martin discovered the concept on a bullet train adventure through the south of France. A year later he brought the technology to his hometown of The Dalles, Oregon located in the Columbia River Gorge. His passion for wine led to Copa di Vino – wine in a glass – a ready to drink wine glass that could go anywhere without the need for a bottle, corkscrew or glass.
 
Copa di Vino Wine Group, Inc.
 
Copa Di Vino is the leading producer of premium wine by the glass in the United States.

E-commerce
 
“Qplash” is our consumer-packaged goods retail division and our first entry point into the growing e-commerce channel. The division sells beverages and groceries online through www.qplash.com, and third-party storefronts such as Amazon.com and Walmart.com. Inside of the division, there are two primary customer groups: business to business retail businesses, which in turn offer the products to their customers, and business to customer, selling direct to end users.
 
Qplash sells to retailers through www.qplash.com. These retailers, generally in the high-end apparel space, buy beverages from Qplash and provide them to their customers in store to enhance their shopping experience. They offer high end beverages for customers to enjoy while shopping or to take on the go. This program allows businesses to control inventory, order with payment terms, and offers the convenience of delivery directly to each store.
 
To the end user, we ship orders from our warehouses direct to their home or office. We offer competitive pricing, an easy and convenient transactional process, and a wide selection of products. Consumers can order from www.qplash.com, from our storefront on Amazon, or other third-party platforms. Amazon is a valuable revenue source as it allows us to access their loyal customer base and provides a high conversion rate as customers are comfortable navigating and checking out through their website.
 
 Currently we offer over 350 listings and have warehouses that ship from both California and Pennsylvania. Our objective is to offer 1,500 items by the fall of 2022.
 
Additionally, this vertically integrated platform affords us a unique opportunity to incubate, accelerate and ultimately migrate brands to traditional distribution.

Manufacturing and Co-packing
 
We are responsible for the manufacturing of the TapouT Performance and SALT.
 
Although we are responsible for manufacturing TapouT Performance and SALT, we do not directly manufacture these products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to third party bottlers and contract packers.
 
Our TapouT Performance and Salt products are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States under separate arrangements with each party. Our co-packaging arrangements are generally on a month-to-month basis or are terminable upon request and do not typically obligate us to produce any minimum quantities of products within specified periods.
 
We purchase concentrates, flavors, dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, and other ingredients for our beverage products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our formulas.
 
The Copa di Vino is bottled at our manufacturing facility in The Dalles, Oregon. Pulpoloco is imported from Spain.
 
Distribution
 
We operate within what is referred to as a “Three Tier Distribution System” where manufacturers do not typically sell directly to retailers, but instead contract for local and regional distribution with independent distributors. These distributors typically have geographic rights to distribute major beverage brands such as Budweiser, Pepsi, and Red Bull and call on every store in a given area such as major cities or regions. However, due to increasing costs over the last 20 years for these distributors to call on every store (sometimes referred to in the industry as “DSD” or direct store delivery), there has been a great deal of consolidation which has limited the options for new brands to gain distribution and retail shelf presence. Our management team believes that their history of success and experience working within this channel will allow us to be successful in building a strong network of these distributors.
 
In addition to working with these independent distributors, we also have distribution arrangements with national retail accounts to distribute some of our products directly through their warehouse operations. Most notably, SBG executed a distribution agreement with AB-InBev, for distribution with their owned operations, AB ONE. This provides SBG very effective distribution capabilities.
 
Employees
 
We have 21 full-time employees, including non-officer employees and our executive officers. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Listing on the NYSE American
 
Our common stock and warrants are listed on the NYSE American exchange under the ticker symbols “SBEV” and “SBEV WS,” respectively.
