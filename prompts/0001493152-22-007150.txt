Viewbix Business Overview
 
Viewbix is an interactive video technology and data platform that provides its client with deep insights into their video marketing performance as well as the effectiveness of its messaging. Viewbix allows companies to add a layer of interactive content on top of a video that allows viewers to engage and interact with the video. The platform measures exactly when a viewer takes an action while watching a video and collects and reports the results to the client.
 
Viewbix developed the interactive video platform based on a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) business model with interactive elements, and the ability to collect and analyze information about each interactive action performed during the viewing of the video clip. The interactive elements and information gathered allows the client to analyze user viewing habits and optimize in real-time throughout the campaign, while increasing the effectiveness of online and live video marketing.

Viewbix has adapted its technology platform to work on most nonproprietary platforms on the Internet, including, but not limited to, online video campaigns, brand and image videos, online tutorials, live and real-time video streaming (e.g. music concerts and sporting events), video presentations, and more. Using the Viewbix platform, video creators can integrate advances features into their videos, specifically the inclusion of “click” buttons that trigger a particular action, into a given video, like the insertion of a smart form for retrieving the contact information of the viewer. Viewbix then collects all the data around the cross section of the viewing data and engagement data and offers its clients the opportunity to download and analyze the results. Viewbix also offers a full service option where the Viewbix account managers will analyze the data and report results and suggestions to its clients.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company initiated certain cost reduction measures during fiscal year-ended December 31, 2020. On January 1, 2020, each of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer tendered their resignations from their respective positions. Moreover, due to the Company’s failure to meet predetermined sales targets set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company determined to reduce the size of its sales team and, likewise, the R&D team was replaced with a more cost-effective consultant. These decisions, and future decisions related to cost-reduction measures, may impact the Company’s ability to sell and support its products in the future and, accordingly, may materially impact the Company’s business operations.
 
Industry Overview
 
Video marketing remains one of the fastest growing industries, and, accordingly is increasingly crowded with competition. According to a study published by Cisco, by 2022 online videos will represent 82% of online consumer traffic. Globally, three trillion minutes (or five million years) of video content will cross the Internet each month by 2022, which is the equivalent of 1.1 million minutes of video streamed or downloaded every second.
 
According to an additional study published by Statista, ad spending is expected to show an annual growth rate of 11%, resulting in a projected market volume of $162,242 million by 2026. In the video advertising segment, it is expected that $136,486 million will be generated through mobile in 2026.
 
Competition
 
While there are many companies that offer hosting and streaming services, Viewbix focuses on providing expanded value to its clients that reaches beyond the hosting and streaming platforms. Viewbix has several direct competitors, including Hapyak, which operates primarily via websites, and Innovid, which focuses on advertisements. Additionally, video hosting companies, such as Wistia and Vidyard, both offer certain interactive elements similar to Viewbix. However, Viewbix’s proprietary component is its focus on interactivity and deep data, whose results can thereafter be analyzed and applied.
