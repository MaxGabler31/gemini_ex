ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General Description of Business
Key Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the largest onshore, rig-based well servicing contractor based on the number of rigs owned. References to “Key,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this report refer to Key Energy Services, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled subsidiaries. We were organized in April 1977 in Maryland and commenced operations in July 1978 under the name National Environmental Group, Inc. In December 1992, we became Key Energy Group, Inc. and we changed our name to Key Energy Services, Inc. in December 1998. In connection with our reorganization described below, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 15, 2016.
We provide a full range of well services to major oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. Our services include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services, and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States. An important component of the Company’s growth strategy is to make acquisitions that will strengthen its core services or presence in selected markets, and the Company also makes strategic divestitures from time to time. To that end, we completed the sale of our business in Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2016, and of our Canadian subsidiary and Russian subsidiary in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. The Company expects that the industry in which it operates will continue to experience consolidation, and as part of its strategy the Company actively explores opportunities arising out of this consolidation, which could include mergers, consolidations or acquisitions or further dispositions or other transactions, including by engaging in discussions with other industry participants concerning these opportunities. There can be no assurance that any such activities will be consummated.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization
On October 24, 2016, Key and certain of our domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) pursuant to a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”). The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on December 6, 2016, and the Company emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on December 15, 2016 (the “Effective Date”). In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date as the “Predecessor Company,” and on and after the Effective Date as the “Successor Company.”
On the Effective Date, the Company:

• | Reincorporated the Successor Company in the state of Delaware and adopted an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;


• | Appointed new members to the Successor Company’s board of directors to replace directors of the Predecessor Company;


• | Issued to the Predecessor Company’s former stockholders, in exchange for the cancellation and discharge of the Predecessor Company’s common stock:


• | 815,887 shares of the Successor Company’s common stock;


• | 919,004 warrants to expire on December 15, 2020 (the “4-Year Warrants”), and 919,004 warrants to expire on December 15, 2021 (the “5-Year Warrants”), each exercisable for one share of the Successor Company’s common stock;


• | Issued to former holders of the Predecessor Company’s 6.75% senior notes, in exchange for the cancellation and discharge of such notes, 7,500,000 shares of the Successor Company’s common stock;


• | Issued 11,769,014 shares of the Successor Company’s common stock to certain participants in rights offerings conducted pursuant to the Plan;


• | Issued to Soter Capital LLC (“Soter”) the sole share of the Successor Company’s Series A Preferred Stock, which confers certain rights to elect directors (but has no economic rights);


• | Entered into a new $80 million senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”), which was increased to $100 million on February 3, 2017, and a $250 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) upon termination of the Predecessor Company’s asset-based revolving credit facility and term loan facility;


• | Entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain stockholders of the Successor Company;


• | Adopted a new management incentive plan (the “2016 Incentive Plan”) for officers, directors and employees of the Successor Company and its subsidiaries; and

Service Offerings
Our reportable business segments are Rig Services, Fishing and Rental Services, Coiled Tubing Services and Fluid Management Services. Our reportable business segments previously included an International segment. We also have a “Functional Support” segment associated with overhead and other costs in support of our reportable segments. Our Rig Services, Fluid Management Services, Coiled Tubing Services and Fishing and Rental Services operate geographically within the United States. The International reportable segment includes our former operations in Mexico, Canada and Russia. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Mexico. We completed the sale of our Canadian subsidiary and Russian subsidiary in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross margin measures. All inter-segment sales pricing is based on current market conditions. See “Note 23. Segment Information” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional financial information about our reportable business segments and the various geographical areas where we operate.
Rig Services
Our Rig Services include the completion of newly drilled wells, workover and recompletion of existing oil and natural gas wells, well maintenance, and the plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives. We also provide specialty drilling services to oil and natural gas producers with certain of our larger rigs that are capable of providing conventional and horizontal drilling services. Our rigs encompass various sizes and capabilities, allowing us to service all types of oil and gas wells. Many of our rigs are outfitted with our proprietary KeyView® technology, which captures and reports well site operating data and provides safety control systems. We believe that this technology allows our customers and our crews to better monitor well site operations, improves efficiency and safety, and adds value to the services that we offer.
The completion and recompletion services provided by our rigs prepare wells for production, whether newly drilled or recently extended through a workover operation. The completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing to access production zones, stimulating and testing these zones, and installing tubular and downhole equipment. We typically provide a well service rig and may also provide other equipment to assist in the completion process. Completion services vary by well and our work may take a few days to several weeks to perform, depending on the nature of the completion.
The workover services that we provide are designed to enhance the production of existing wells and generally are more complex and time consuming than normal maintenance services. Workover services can include deepening or extending wellbores into new formations by drilling horizontal or lateral wellbores, sealing off depleted production zones and accessing previously bypassed production zones, converting former production wells into injection wells for enhanced recovery operations and conducting major subsurface repairs due to equipment failures. Workover services may last from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity of the workover.
Maintenance services provided with our rig fleet are generally required throughout the life cycle of an oil or natural gas well. Examples of these maintenance services include routine mechanical repairs to the pumps, tubing and other equipment, removing debris and formation material from wellbores, and pulling rods and other downhole equipment from wellbores to identify and resolve production problems. Maintenance services are generally less complicated than completion and workover related services and require less time to perform.
Our rig fleet is also used in the process of permanently shutting-in oil or natural gas wells that are at the end of their productive lives. These plugging and abandonment services generally require auxiliary equipment in addition to a well servicing rig. The demand for plugging and abandonment services is not significantly impacted by the demand for oil and natural gas because well operators are required by state regulations to plug wells that are no longer productive.
We believe that the largest competitors for our Rig Services include C & J Energy Services, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Forbes Energy Services Ltd., Pioneer Energy Services Corp, Ranger Energy Services, Inc.,
and Nine Energy Services. Numerous smaller companies also compete in our rig-based markets in the United States.
Fishing and Rental Services
We offer a full line of fishing services and rental equipment designed for use in providing onshore drilling and workover services. Fishing services involve recovering lost or stuck equipment in the wellbore utilizing a broad array of “fishing tools.” Our rental tool inventory consists of drill pipe, tubulars, handling tools (including our patented Hydra-Walk® pipe-handling units and services), pressure-control equipment, pumps, power swivels, reversing units and foam air units. Our rental inventory also included

frac stack equipment used to support hydraulic fracturing operations and the associated flowback of frac fluids, proppants, oil and natural gas. We also had provided well-testing services. Our frac stack equipment and well-testing services were sold in the second quarter of 2017.
Demand for our Fishing and Rental Services is also closely related to capital spending by oil and natural gas producers.
Our primary competitors for our Fishing and Rental Services include Baker Oil Tools (owned by Baker Hughes Incorporated), Weatherford International Ltd., Basic Energy Services, Inc., Smith Services (owned by Schlumberger), Superior Energy Services, Inc., Quail Tools (owned by Parker Drilling Company) and Knight Oil Tools. Numerous smaller companies also compete in our fishing and rental services markets in the United States.
Coiled Tubing Services
 Coiled Tubing Services involve the use of a continuous metal pipe spooled onto a large reel which is then deployed into oil and natural gas wells to perform various applications, such as wellbore clean-outs, nitrogen jet lifts, through-tubing fishing, and formation stimulations utilizing acid and chemical treatments. Coiled tubing, particularly larger diameter coil units, is also used for a number of horizontal well applications such as milling temporary isolation plugs that separate frac zones and various other pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing well preparation services.
Our primary competitors in the Coiled Tubing Services market include Schlumberger Ltd., Baker Hughes Incorporated, Halliburton Company, Superior Energy Services, Inc., Nine Energy Services and C & J Energy Services, Inc. Numerous smaller companies also compete in our coiled tubing services markets in the United States. Demand for these services generally corresponds to demand for well completion services.
Fluid Management Services
We provide transportation and well-site storage services for various fluids utilized in connection with drilling, completions, workover and maintenance activities. We also provide disposal services for fluids produced subsequent to well completion. These fluids are removed from the well site and transported for disposal in saltwater disposal (“SWD”) wells owned by us or a third party. Demand and pricing for these services generally correspond to demand for our well service rigs.
We believe that the largest competitors for our domestic fluid management services include Select Energy Services, Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., C & J Energy Services, Inc., Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Forbes Energy Services Ltd., and Stallion Oilfield Services Ltd. Numerous smaller companies also compete in the fluid management services market in the United States.
International Segment
Our International segment included our former operations in Mexico, Canada and Russia. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Mexico, and we completed the sale of our Canadian subsidiary and Russian subsidiary in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. Our services in these international markets consisted of rig-based services such as the maintenance, workover, and recompletion of existing oil wells, completion of newly-drilled wells, and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives. We also had a technology development and control systems business based in Canada, which was focused on the development of hardware and software related to oilfield service equipment controls, data acquisition and digital information flow.
Functional Support Segment
Our Functional Support segment includes unallocated overhead costs associated with sales, safety and administrative support for each of our reporting segments.
Equipment Overview
We categorize our rigs and equipment as active, warm stacked or cold stacked. We consider an active rig or piece of equipment to be a unit that is working, deployed, available for work or idle. A warm stacked rig or piece of equipment is a unit that is down for repair or needs repair. A cold stacked rig or piece of equipment is a unit that would require such significant investment to redeploy that we may salvage for parts, sell the unit or scrap the unit. The definitions of active, warm stacked or cold stacked are used for the majority of our equipment.

Rigs
As mentioned above, our fleet is diverse and allows us to work on all types of wells, ranging from very shallow wells to long horizontal laterals. Higher derrick lifting capacity rigs will be utilized to service the deeper wells and longer laterals as they require a higher pull weight and taller derrick. The lower derrick lifting capacity rigs are typically used on shallower, less complex wells. In most cases, these rigs can be reassigned to other regions should market conditions warrant the transfer of equipment. The following table summarizes our rigs based on derrick height measured in feet as of December 31, 2018:

 | Derrick Height (Feet)
 | < 102’ | ≥ 102’ | | Total
Active | 102 | | 163 | | 265
Warm stacked | 173 | | 87 | | 260
Cold stacked | 246 | | 108 | | 354
Total | 521 | | 358 | | 879

Coiled Tubing
Coiled tubing uses a spooled continuous metal pipe that is injected downhole in oil and gas wells in order to convey tools, log, stimulate, clean-out and perform other intervention functions. Typically, larger diameter coiled tubing is able to service longer lateral horizontal wells. The table below summarizes our Coiled Tubing Services fleet by pipe diameter as of December 31, 2018:

 | Pipe Diameter
 | < 2” | ≥ 2” < 2.375” | | ≥ 2.375” | Total
Active | 10 | | 2 | | 9 | 21
Warm stacked | 6 | | 5 | | 2 | 13
Cold stacked | 6 | | 7 | | 2 | 15
Total | 22 | | 14 | | 13 | 49

Fluid Management Services
We have an extensive and diverse fleet of oilfield transportation service vehicles. We broadly define an oilfield transportation service vehicle as any heavy-duty, revenue-generating vehicle weighing over one ton. Our transportation fleet includes vacuum trucks, winch trucks, hot oilers and other vehicles, including kill trucks and various hauling and transport trucks. The table below summarizes our Fluid Management Services fleet as of December 31, 2018:

 | Active | Warm Stacked | | Cold Stacked | Total
Truck Type | | | | | 
Vacuum Trucks | 241 | | 151 | | 24 | 416
Winch Trucks | 71 | | 25 | | 10 | 106
Hot Oil Trucks | 21 | | 19 | | 8 | 48 
Kill Trucks | 37 | | 27 | | 9 | 73 
Other | 37 | | 14 | | 6 | 57 
Total | 407 | | 236 | | 57 | 700

Disposal Wells
As part of our Fluid Management Services, we provide disposal services for fluids produced subsequent to well completion. These fluids are removed from the well site and transported for disposal in SWD wells. The table below summarizes our SWD facilities, and brine and freshwater stations by state as of December 31, 2018:

 | Owned | Leased(1) | | Total
Location | | | | 
Arkansas | 1 | | — | | 1 
Louisiana | 3 | | — | | 3 
New Mexico | 1 | | 9 | | 10
Texas | 23 | | 27 | | 50
Total | 28 | | 36 | | 64


(1) | Includes SWD facilities as “leased” if we own the wellbore for the SWD but lease the land. In other cases, we lease both the wellbore and the land. Lease terms vary among different sites, but with respect to some of the SWD facilities for which we lease the land and own the wellbore, the land owner has an option under the land lease to retain the wellbore at the termination of the lease.

Other Business Data
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials.
Customers
Our customers include major oil companies, independent oil and natural gas production companies. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, Chevron Texaco Exploration and Production accounted for approximately 12% and 14% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. During the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016, OXY USA Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the period from December 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the period from January 1, 2016 through December 15, 2016. No customers accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Competition and Other External Factors
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition is influenced by such factors as product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. We devote substantial resources toward employee safety and training programs. We believe many of our larger customers place increased emphasis on the safety, performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work. However, in numerous instances, we secure and maintain work for large customers for which efficiency, safety, technology, size of fleet and availability of other services are of equal importance to price.
The demand for our services and price we receive fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven for the most part by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in a lower oil and natural gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work. Because these types of services can be easily “started” and “stopped,” and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Furthermore, in a low commodity price environment, fewer well service rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity.

Index to Financial Statements

The level of our revenues, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. and international oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.
Seasonality
Our operations are impacted by seasonal factors. Historically, our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays. During the summer months, our operations may be impacted by tropical or other inclement weather systems. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. In addition, the majority of our equipment works only during daylight hours. In the winter months when days become shorter, this reduces the amount of time that our assets can work and therefore has a negative impact on total hours worked. Lastly, during the fourth quarter, we historically experience a significant slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons and demand sometimes slows during this period as our customers exhaust their annual spending budgets.
Patents, Trade Secrets, Trademarks and Copyrights 
We own numerous patents, trademarks and proprietary technology that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the various markets in which we operate or intend to operate. We have devoted significant resources to developing technological improvements in our well service business and have sought patent protection for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. All the issued patents have varying remaining durations and begin expiring between 2019 and 2035.
We own several trademarks that are important to our business. In general, depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use, or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. While our patents and trademarks, in the aggregate, are of considerable importance to maintaining our competitive position, no single patent or trademark is considered to be of a critical or essential nature to our business.
We also rely on a combination of trade secret laws, copyright and contractual provisions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. We typically enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, strategic partners and suppliers and limit access to the distribution of our proprietary information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,600 persons. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. As noted below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” we have historically experienced a high employee turnover rate. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and consider our relations with our employees to be generally satisfactory.
Governmental Regulations 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws or regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations affecting our business will be adopted, or the effect such changes might have on us, our financial condition or our business. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject and for which a lack of compliance may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations routinely involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials, and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct of certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.

Index to Financial Statements

In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
Some scientific studies suggest that emissions of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) may contribute to warming of Earth’s atmosphere. While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business could increase our costs in order to comply with any new laws.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA,” which applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly and jointly and severally liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees and state and local government authorities.
Saltwater Disposal Wells
We operate SWD wells that are subject to the CWA, Safe Drinking Water Act, and state and local laws and regulations, including those established by the Underground Injection Control Program of the Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA,” which establishes the minimum program requirements. Most of our SWD wells are located in Texas. We also operate SWD wells in Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Regulations in these states require us to obtain an Underground Injection Control permit to operate each of our SWD wells. The applicable regulatory agency may suspend or modify one or more of our permits if our well operations are likely to result in pollution of freshwater, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or if the well leaks into the environment.
