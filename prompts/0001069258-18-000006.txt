Item 1. Business.
Overview
Kratos is a government contractor at the forefront of the U.S. Department of Defense’s (the “DoD”) Third Offset Strategy and Rapid Innovation Initiatives. Kratos is a leading technology, intellectual property, proprietary product and system solution company focused on the U.S. and its allies’ national security. Kratos is a recognized industry leader in the rapid development, demonstration and fielding of high technology systems and products at an affordable cost. A key element of our business plan is to make Company-funded investments related to key platforms, products and systems, so that we own the related intellectual property, providing us designed in, sole and single source positions with our offerings. We are an industry leader in high performance, jet powered, unmanned aerial drone target systems used to test weapon systems and to train the warfighter and a provider of high performance unmanned combat aerial systems for force multiplication and amplification. We are also an industry leader in satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security/warfare, missile defense and combat and training systems. Our workforce is primarily engineering and technically oriented with a significant number of employees holding national security clearances. Substantially all of our work is performed at customer locations, in a secure facility or at a critical infrastructure location. Our primary end customers are national and homeland security related agencies. We believe that our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products and designed-in positions on our customers’ programs, platforms and systems gives us a competitive advantage and creates a high barrier to entry into our markets. Our entire organization is focused on executing our strategy of becoming the leading technology and intellectual property based company in our industry. 
Industry Update

In May 2017, the President signed into law the fiscal year (“FY”) 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act. In total for 2017, Congress appropriated $524 billion in base discretionary funding for the DoD, consistent with the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “BCA”). Congress also appropriated approximately $68 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (“OCO”) funding and approximately $15 billion in additional DoD appropriations.
In May 2017, the President released a revised FY 2018 budget request, which seeks $575 billion for the DoD’s base budget, approximately $52 billion above the statutory caps provided for in the BCA. The President’s budget request also seeks an additional $65 billion in OCO funding for expeditionary needs, not capped by the BCA.
On September 8, 2017, the President signed a continuing resolution which generally funded the government at FY 2017 levels through December 8, 2017. The continuing resolution was extended to December 22, 2017 and further extended to January 19, 2018. As Congress did not enact appropriations legislation or a new continuing resolution by January 19, 2018, on January 20, 2018, the U.S. Government temporarily shut down. On January 22, 2018, a fourth continuing resolution was 
3

enacted, which funded the government through February 8, 2018.
On February 9, 2018, the Congress approved and the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provides that:

1. | spending limits created by the BCA will be increased by approximately $300 billion over the next two years;


2. | defense spending will be increased by $80 billion in the current FY and by $85 billion next year, to approximately $700 billion and $705 billion, respectively;


3. | domestic spending will be increased by $63 billion this year and by $68 billion next year; and


4. | Congress will suspend the debt limit through March 2019, putting the next debt limit vote past the 2018 midterm elections.

The Congress and the President also executed a fifth continuing resolution authorization through March 23, 2018, to provide congressional appropriators the time required to appropriately document and allocate the authorized spending.
The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the Company’s programs in particular in the future. If a prolonged government shutdown were to occur, it could result in program cancellations and/or stop work orders and could limit our ability to perform on our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government’s ability to make timely payments.
Current Reporting Segments

The Company operates in three reportable segments. The Kratos Government Solutions (“KGS”) reportable segment which is comprised of an aggregation of KGS operating segments, the Unmanned Systems (“US”) reportable segment, and the Public Safety & Security (“PSS”) reportable segment.
KGS has four operating segments: Defense Rocket Support Services (“DRSS”), Microwave Electronics Division (“ME”), Technical and Training Solutions (“TTS”), and Modular Systems (“MS”) that provide technology-based defense solutions, involving products and services, primarily for mission critical U.S. National Security priorities, with the primary focus relating to the nation’s Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance requirements. The US reportable segment provides unmanned aerial systems and unmanned ground and seaborne systems. The PSS reportable segment provides integrated solutions for advanced homeland security, public safety, critical infrastructure security, and security and surveillance systems for government, industrial and commercial customers.
We organize our business segments based primarily on the nature of the products, solutions and services offered. Transactions between segments are negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts, and these intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. From a customer and solutions perspective, we view our business as an integrated whole, leveraging skills and assets wherever possible.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that our intellectual property, proprietary products, and technology are strongly aligned with certain of the highest priority spending areas of the DoD, and the DoD’s focus on leveraging technology to defeat or deter peer and near-peer adversaries. We also believe that our proven ability to rapidly design, develop, demonstrate and field leading technology products and systems at an affordable cost differentiates us from our competitors. When combined with our longstanding customer relationships, and the designed-in position of our systems, technology and products into our customers’ platforms, programs, and systems, we believe these factors provide a unique competitive advantage and position us well for accelerated growth.
Specialized national security focus aligned with mission-critical national security priorities. Continued concerns related to the threats posed by certain foreign nations, including nations with peer or near peer capabilities and terrorists have caused the U.S. Government to identify national security as an area of functional and spending priority. Budget pressures, particularly related to DoD spending, have placed a premium on developing and fielding low-cost, high-technology solutions to assist in national security missions. While recent budget pressures have at times caused delays in orders for our business, current budget projections, including the pending fiscal 2018 and 2019 DoD budgets, suggest defense spending will increase over the next few years. The improving outlook for defense spending is primarily focused on enhanced power projection, 
4

warfighting readiness, lethality, and recapitalization of key strategic defense systems to address peer and near peer threats. Our primary capabilities and areas of focus, listed below, are strongly aligned with the objectives of the U.S. Government:

• | Unmanned aerial drone, unmanned ground and unmanned seaborne systems


• | Satellite communications and radio frequency interference detection location and mitigation


• | Microwave electronics supporting warfare, missile, radar and communication systems


• | Electronic warfare, attack, missile, and radar systems


• | Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance


• | Ballistic missile defense systems


• | Command, control and combat systems


• | Cybersecurity and information assurance


• | Specialized training systems and operational readiness

IP-centric defense company with proprietary products and technology which address critical current and emerging threats faced by U.S. and allied militaries. As a technology-focused defense company at the forefront of the DoD’s strategy of technology rich and affordable systems, our current and growing portfolio of proprietary products, solutions, and related intellectual property addresses some of the most critical needs of U.S. and allied militaries in the fields of unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cybersecurity/warfare, missile defense, combat and training systems. A key element of our customers’ strategy, and where we have invested significantly, is the development of capabilities and intellectual property addressing the recent challenges faced by U.S. and allied militaries in Anti-Access and Aerial-Denial (“A2/AD”) environments. This is evidenced by our significant investment in high-performance Unmanned Aerial Drone System (“UADS”) platforms and technology, which has culminated in a series of Unmanned Combat Aerial System (“UCAS”) contract wins. Additionally, with our satellite and terrestrial ground segment command, control, radio frequency interference monitoring, geolocation and mitigation products and capabilities, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the 2018 DoD budget request of $9.3 billion for space investments, a 29.1 percent increase over the 2017 budget, and a significant portion of which is for the development and protection of U.S. national security space assets and infrastructure. Accordingly, our proprietary products, systems and technologies are developed and refined with the goal of enabling our customers to maintain an advantage over the advanced and constantly evolving threats of adversaries, at an affordable cost. In many instances, we are one of the few companies that produce the mission-critical technology our customers require, or we outperformed our peers in a competitive bidding process. We maintain a strategy of internally funding research and development and owning the intellectual property of many of these high-performance capabilities and systems.
Technology-driven company aligned with and supporting our customers’ increased innovation, technology, and strategic national security initiatives, with focus on speed and affordability. As the DoD works to increase or maintain its technological advantage over adversaries, it has continued its efforts to create breakthrough technologies for national security, accelerate innovation to the warfighter, and repurpose current capabilities to create cost-effective, disruptive technology advances. With our focus on delivering leading edge systems, products and technologies that address the most critical current and emerging threats, our customers include some of the most technologically advanced organizations of the defense establishment, including the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (“DIUx”), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”), Air Force Research Laboratory (“AFRL”), the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), the Strategic Command (STRATCOM), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. intelligence community, and other confidential customers. We believe our focus on constant innovation, capability improvements across our product and solutions portfolio, speed of development and production and affordability are key differentiators that align us with and address our customers’ key initiatives.
In-depth understanding of customer missions. We have a reputation for successfully and rapidly designing, developing, demonstrating and fielding mission-critical products, solutions and services to our customers, at an affordable cost. Our long-term relationships with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and other national security related customers and agencies enable us to develop an in-depth understanding of their missions, problems and technical requirements. In addition, a substantial number of our employees are located at our customer locations, or at secure manufacturing facilities or at critical infrastructure locations, all of which provides Kratos with valuable strategic insight into our customers’ ongoing missions and future program and mission requirements. This understanding of our customers’ missions, requirements, and needs, in conjunction with the strategic location of our employees, enables us to offer technical solutions tailored to our customers’ specific requirements and evolving mission objectives. In addition, once we are on-site with a customer and providing our products and solutions, we have historically been successful in winning new and recompete business. 
Kratos is one of the industry leaders in high performance, jet powered, unmanned aerial target drone systems which are designed to replicate state of the art adversarial fighter aircraft, missiles and other threats. Kratos is the sole source or primary unmanned aerial target drone system provider to the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Army, and numerous allied foreign defense agencies.

Leveraging off of this technology, for which Kratos owns the intellectual property, we made a significant investment over the past four years developing Kratos’ first UCAS, our Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform (“UTAP-22”), now formally called “Mako.” After successfully achieving the Mako’s first concept flights at the end of 2015, in 2016 we received a $12.6 million single-award contract to demonstrate certain payload integration and loyal wingman teaming with manned aircraft in a major military exercise. This contract is one of the largest recently awarded contracts by the DIUx. We are currently under contract with several additional customers related to Kratos’ Mako.
A select sample of other key Kratos’ UAS products and contracts includes:

• | In 2016, we were awarded two of the four Gremlins Phase I UAS contracts awarded by DARPA, the government’s leader in breakthrough technologies for national security. For one contract we are a prime or lead contractor, and for the other contract we are teamed with a lead partner company.


• | In 2017, we successfully advanced to Phase II of the Gremlin’s program, teamed with our partner company.


• | In 2016 we were awarded the AFRL Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration (“LCASD”) UCAS single-award cost share contract. The LCASD is an approximately 30 foot by 22 foot unmanned strike aerial drone system. We expect the initial flight of this leading technology UAS to occur in 2018.


• | In 2016 we were awarded a contract by the DIUx related to our UTAP-22 Mako UCAS.


• | We have redeveloped our Air Force Subscale Aerial Target BQM-167 into what we believe to be the highest performance unmanned aircraft in the world, the U.S. Navy Sub-Sonic Aerial Target (“SSAT”) Drone BQM-177A, with low rate initial production awarded to Kratos in June 2017. We expect the SSAT program to become one of the largest and most important to Kratos in the near term.


• | We recently received a single award of $93 million from the U.S. Army Contract Command for advanced subscale aerial drone systems, an unmanned target aircraft with launchers and associated ground equipment and spares, with an estimated completion date of December 17, 2022.


• | We recently received an approximately $23 million sole source initial production award for a new high performance, jet powered UADS which has been under development, with an expected execution period through 2018.

We believe that our internally developed and owned intellectual property allows us to provide more capable jet powered, unmanned aircraft, designed to fly in A2/AD environments and with performance capabilities equal to or greater than fourth generation manned jet fighter aircraft, at an affordable cost. Kratos’ tactical UAS provide force multiplication and augmentation for manned high performance fighter aircraft. We believe that there are very few high-performance UAS that are as advanced as our technologies addressing the A2/AD environment, which the DoD has identified as a U.S. capabilities gap. As such, consistent with the needs and requirements of the U.S. and allied militaries, we believe that our leadership in these types of high performance unmanned aircraft provides us with a future market opportunity of these types of low-cost, high-performance systems.
We are also an industry leader in ground-based command, control and communications systems for satellites, and a leader in related radio frequency interference identification, geolocation and mitigation. Our primary customers include the U.S. Air Force, Space Command and other agencies. Our microwave electronics business products have designed-in positions on critical combat system programs, including Barak, Gripen, Iron Dome, Sling of David, F-15, F-16 and Arrow. Our advanced capabilities in the training systems and solutions market, including for aircraft and combat vehicles, have allowed us to successfully remain at the forefront of defense industry readiness initiatives. We believe our strategy of internally funding the research and development of many of our systems, products, solutions and capabilities will continue to solidify our position in high growth markets, such as high performance UADS, satellite communications, microwave electronics and training systems, and allow us to grow, over the long-term, at a rate greater than that of the industry.
Diverse base of key contracts with low concentration. Many of our contracts are single-award and/or sole source in nature, where we are the only awardee by the customer. In many cases, our ability to obtain single award, sole source contracts is due to our intellectual property, proprietary products, historical performance qualifications, relative experience and affordability. Additionally, as a result of our business development focus on securing key contracts, we are also a preferred contractor on numerous multi-year, government-wide acquisition contracts (“GWACs”) and multiple award contracts. Our preferred contractor status provides us with the opportunity to bid on billions of dollars of business each year against a discrete number of other pre-qualified companies.
6

We have a highly diverse base of customers and contracts with no contract representing more than 5% of 2017 revenue. Our fixed-price contracts, the majority of which are production contracts, represent approximately 88% of our 2017 revenue. Our cost-plus-fee contracts and time and materials contracts represent approximately 8% and 4%, respectively, of our 2017 revenue. We believe our diverse base of key contracts and low reliance on any one contract provides us with a stable, balanced revenue stream. Our recent major contract awards, including a $93 million UAS award with the Army, $23 million UAS sole source initial production award, $37 million SSAT low rate initial production contract, $16 million in specialized equipment for radars and systems, $22 million Lot 13 Option Exercise for the Air Force Subscale Aerial Target program, $46 million single award training contract to support the Royal Saudi Naval Forces, $54 million Marine Common Aircrew Trainers, $20 million KC-46 Tanker Maintenance Training System, and multiple tactical UADS awards have continued to allow us to grow the business while maintaining a diverse contract base.
Significant cash flow visibility driven by stable backlog. As of December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, our total backlog (see Backlog below) was approximately $730.4 million and $899.7 million respectively, of which approximately $531.1 million was funded in 2017 and $626.1 million was funded in 2016. The majority of our sales are from awards issued under long-term contracts, typically three to five years in duration. Our contract backlog provides visibility into stable future revenue and cash flow over a diverse set of contracts. Importantly, a number of our systems and products are designed-in on and support long term, multi-year/multi-decade programs, which provides significant operational and financial visibility to our Company.
Highly skilled employees and an experienced management team. We deliver our systems, products and services through a skilled and primarily engineering and technically oriented workforce of approximately 2,900 employees. Our senior managers have significant experience with U.S. Government agencies, the U.S. military and U.S. Government contractors. A significant number of Kratos employees hold national security clearances. Members of our management team have experience growing businesses both organically and through acquisitions and delivering significant value to stakeholders. We believe that the cumulative experience and differentiated expertise of our personnel in our core focus areas, coupled with our sizable and technically oriented employee base, allow us to qualify for and bid on larger programs and contracts in a prime contracting role.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to focus on our core business areas, including Unmanned Systems, Satellite Communications, Cyber Security, Microwave Electronics, Missile Defense and Training Systems. We will continue to invest in differentiating systems, products, technology and intellectual property. We intend to be the leader in rapidly developing, demonstrating and delivering to the warfighter leading technology systems, at an affordable cost.
Internal Growth
We are focused on generating internal growth by capitalizing on our ability to rapidly develop, demonstrate and field leading technology systems and products at an affordable cost. We will make targeted discretionary investments in mission critical DoD priority areas including; unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security and training systems, which have the highest potential for growth based on recent DoD funding requests, and in which we will retain the intellectual property rights.
Expand technology product, solution and service offerings provided to existing customers. We are focused on expanding the technology, products, systems and solutions we provide to our current customers by leveraging our strong relationships, technical capabilities, intellectual property and past performance qualifications as well as by offering a wider range of comprehensive low-cost technology rich products and solutions. In regard to areas of specialization, our product and solution offerings include the manufacturing of specialized defense electronics; integrated technology solutions for satellite command, control and communications; specialized high performance UADS and aircraft for tactical and threat representation target purposes; and Unmanned Ground Systems (“UGS”) and Unmanned Seaborne Systems (“USS”). We believe our understanding of customer needs, missions, requirements and processes, and our ability to rapidly deliver low cost, technology leading systems, products and solutions, position us well for success in the current National Security environment.
Capitalize on current contract base. We are pursuing new program and contract opportunities and awards as we build the business with our expanding technology base, intellectual property ownership, contract portfolio, and product, solution and service offerings. We are also aggressively pursuing several national security priority areas, including high performance UADS, satellite communications command, control, communication and signal monitoring products, microwave electronics for missiles, radars, electronic warfare and communications, cyber security solutions, specialized training systems, autonomy and artificial intelligence systems, robotics, directed energy systems, hypersonic systems, electromagnetic rail gun systems and next generation ballistic missile targets. We are also assessing new tactical program areas and platforms to pursue that are consistent with our core capabilities, technology and intellectual property.
7

Expand customer and contract base. We are focused on expanding our customer base into areas with significant growth opportunities as indicated by the FY 2018 and 2019 DoD budget request, by leveraging our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products, capabilities, industry reputation, long-term customer relationships and diverse contract base. We also believe that our ability to rapidly develop, demonstrate and field high technology systems and products at an affordable cost is a clear competitive differentiator for our Company. We anticipate that this overall expansion in our capabilities will enable us both to pursue larger program opportunities, higher value work and to further diversify our revenue base across additional U.S. Government, international and commercial customers.
Improve operating margins. We believe that we have opportunities to increase our operating margins and improve profitability by capitalizing on our corporate infrastructure investments as our business grows, production of our products and systems increases and related revenues increase. We are proactively focused on continuously improving efficiencies, reducing costs, and concentrating our efforts on operational excellence.
Invest in strategic growth areas. Over the past several years, we have made significant internally funded investments in strategic growth areas including unmanned tactical aircraft drone systems. Specifically, we have increased internally funded research and development, capital expenditures and infrastructure investments, including executive management, bid, proposal and new business capture, pursuit and related expenses. We have made these investments with the intention of developing, demonstrating, fielding and bringing to production high performance jet powered unmanned aerial combat systems. These investments also allow us to retain the intellectual property rights, design and data packages for these platforms and systems, and to ultimately secure sole source production positions in these strategic growth areas. Specifically, since 2012, we have invested over $85 million in our UAS through internally funded research, development and contract design retrofit costs for new platforms under development and capital expenditures for aircraft and related equipment related to this strategic growth area.

• | We invested in internally funded research, development and capital expenditures to build our own UTAP-22 (Mako) UAS from 2012 to 2015, and demonstrated the capabilities of the UTAP-22 Mako in a flight demonstration in the fall of 2015. As a result, we were awarded an initial $12.6 million prime contract from the DIUx for sensor integration and flight demonstration of our UTAP-22 Mako unmanned aerial system the following year. Under this effort, we integrated certain sensors into our UTAP-22 Mako and participated in a large, complex flight exercise in 2017. We are currently working under a funded contract on Kratos’ UTAP-22 Mako.


• | We received a $40.8 million single award, cost-share contract from the AFRL for the LCASD. Under the LCASD contract award, we are designing, developing, and will deliver, demonstrate and test a technical baseline for a high-speed long-range, low-cost limited life-strike UAS. For our investment, we will retain hard (including two LCASD aircraft) and other assets, and important intellectual property, software, data, platform and system rights, which we believe will be critically important and valuable over the expected long-term life of this platform, including with respect to future production opportunities.


• | We were awarded one of four prime contract awards from the DARPA for the Gremlins program. Under the Gremlins program, DARPA envisions a swarm of approximately 20 high performance unmanned aerial vehicles that are deployed by an inflight aircraft, and are later recovered, inflight, by an aircraft. The approximate $3.9 million Phase I contracts were awarded to four competing companies, with the intent to ultimately down select to one finalist company over a period of approximately 36 months. In 2017, we successfully advanced to Phase II of the Gremlin’s program, teamed with our partner company.

Capitalize on corporate infrastructure investments. In recent periods, we have made significant investments in our senior management and corporate infrastructure related to cyber security threats to our Company, increased and changing regulations we are subject to, and the changing national security industry environment. These investments also included hiring senior executives with significant experience in the national security industry, hiring firms to support us on Capitol Hill, Congressionally and with our customers, strengthening our internal controls over financial reporting and accounting staff in support of increasing public company reporting requirements, expanding our infrastructure in response to increases in cybersecurity protection and related regulatory requirements, and expanding our backlog and bid and proposal pipeline. We expect to be allocating additional resources in our pursuit of new, larger and highly technical prime contract opportunities. We believe our management experience and corporate infrastructure can support a company with a much larger revenue base than ours. Accordingly, we believe that, to the extent our revenue grows, we will be able to leverage this infrastructure base and increase our operating margins.

Customers
A representative list of customers in our KGS and US segments during 2017 included the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Missile Defense Agency, Space Command, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Foreign Military Sales (“FMS”), the U.S. Southern Command, STRATCOM, the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), DIUx, the Rapid Capabilities Offices, the U.S. intelligence community and certain confidential customers. In 2017, representative customers in the PSS segment included Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, Prince George’s County Public Schools, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, JP Morgan Chase, Alamo Colleges, City of Galveston, Texas Orthopedic Hospital, Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, Fidelity, Scripps Clinic, PNC Bank, AT&T, Exxon, Calpine Power Plants, DuPont Fabros, BP America, Houston Community College, Siemens, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and New Flyer.
Revenue from the U.S. Government (which includes FMS) includes revenue from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. Revenues from U.S. Government agency customers in aggregate accounted for approximately 60%, 60% and 61% of total revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Revenues from foreign customers were approximately $84.7 million or 11%, $80.1 million or 12%, and $73.2 million or 11% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 25, 2016, and December 27, 2015, respectively.
Backlog

As of December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, our backlog was approximately $730.4 million and $899.7 million, respectively, of which $531.1 million was funded in 2017 and $626.1 million was funded in 2016. Backlog is our estimate of the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the remaining life of awarded contracts and task orders that we have in hand as of the measurement date. Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded backlog. We define funded backlog as estimated future revenue under government contracts and task orders for which funding has been appropriated by Congress and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency, plus our estimate of the future revenue we expect to realize from our commercial contracts that are under firm orders. Our funded backlog does not include the full potential value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds to be used by an agency for a particular program of a contract on a yearly or quarterly basis even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. As a result, contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until Congress makes subsequent appropriation and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract.
Unfunded backlog reflects our estimate of future revenue under awarded government contracts and task orders for which either funding has not yet been appropriated or the expenditure has not yet been authorized. Our total backlog does not include estimates of revenue from government wide acquisition contracts (“GWACs”) or General Services Administration (“GSA”) schedules beyond awarded or funded task orders, but our unfunded backlog does include estimates of revenue beyond awarded or funded task orders for other types of indefinite delivery or indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts. Unfunded backlog also includes priced options, which consist of the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as a result of a customer exercising an option period that has been specifically defined in the original contract award.

Contracts undertaken by us may extend beyond one year. Accordingly, portions are carried forward from one year to the next as part of backlog. Because many factors affect the scheduling of projects, no assurance can be given as to when revenue will be realized on projects included in our backlog. Although funded backlog represents only business that is considered to be firm, we cannot guarantee that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur. The majority of funded backlog represents contracts with terms that would entitle us to all or a portion of our costs incurred and potential fees upon cancellation by the customer.
A significant number of the programs that Kratos systems, products and solutions support are multi-year/multi-decade in nature. Accordingly, based on historical customer usage or operational tempo, the Company has reasonable expectations or visibility of what ultimate orders for Kratos’ systems, products and solutions will be. The Company does not include these expected amounts in its backlog until a related contract award is received.
Management believes that year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future revenues. The actual timing of receipt of revenues, if any, on projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the scheduling of projects. In addition, cancellations or adjustments to contracts may occur. Backlog is typically subject to large 
9

variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded. Additionally, all U.S. Government contracts included in backlog, whether or not funded, may be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. Government.
Upon the Company’s adoption of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, the Company’s backlog will be calculated as the dollar value of the remaining performance obligations on executed contracts. Backlog can include award fees, incentive fees, or other variable consideration estimated at the most likely amount to which the Company is expected to be entitled to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Backlog can include both funded and unfunded future revenue under government contracts. Backlog will not include orders for which neither party has performed and which each party has the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party. As such, backlog generally will not include options for additional performance obligations which have not been executed unless they are considered a material right of the base agreement or contract. For IDIQ contracts, only tasks that have been executed should be included for backlog purposes. Based on the expected impact to the reported backlog that will occur upon adoption of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, we expect that our backlog balance as of December 31, 2017 when recast on a pro forma comparative basis in accordance with ASU 2014-09 will be reduced.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had a work force of approximately 2,900 full-time, part-time and on-call employees.
Competition
Our market is competitive and includes a number of companies in the U.S. defense and National Security industries. Most of the companies that we compete against have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and generate greater revenues than we do. Competition in the KGS and US segments include tier one, large U.S. Government contractors and system integrators such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon, BAE Systems, L3, Orbital/ATK and Boeing. While we view other government contractors as competitors, we also team with these same companies in joint proposals or in the delivery of our products, solutions and services for customers. Tier two competitors include smaller government contractors such as Mercury Computer, Qinetiq, Cobham, Aerojet Rocketdyne and AAR. Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of our business within the defense industry. It is also common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor or subcontractor on an award may, upon final award of the contract to another competitor, become a subcontractor for the final prime contractor. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or be a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not frequently found in other industries.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our ability to win new business include our intellectual property, proprietary products, technology and our ability to rapidly develop, demonstrate and deliver systems to the warfighter at an affordable cost. Also important is our past performance qualifications, customer relationships, domain and technology expertise, the ability to obtain and replace contract vehicles, the ability to deliver results within budget (time and cost), reputation, accountability, staffing flexibility, and project management expertise. Additionally, our ability to deliver cost effective systems, products, solutions and services that meet our customers’ requirements is also a key differentiator.
In the U.S. defense, IT, and services markets, the U.S. Government has stressed competition and affordability in connection with its future procurement of products and services. This has led to fewer sole source awards, as well as more emphasis on cost competitiveness, with contract awards issued on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (“LPTA”) basis rather than a best value basis, which has negatively impacted our DRSS business in our KGS segment. In addition, competitor bid protests have become more prevalent in the current competitive environment, resulting in further delay of contract procurement activity.
The majority of our government services business is included in our DRSS business. This cost competitive environment resulted in an impairment in the carrying value of our DRSS business in the fourth quarter of 2017. Approximately 10% of Kratos’ business for the year ended December 31, 2017 is IT or government services based. In 2010, Kratos changed its strategy to focus on being a system, product, technology and intellectual property based company and we deemphasized our focus in our legacy government services businesses. See the Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to rapidly develop new products and services, and enhancements to and applications for our existing products and services, to be delivered at an affordable cost. Our research and development expenses were $17.8 million, $13.9 million and $16.2 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We intend to continue our focus on research and development as a key strategy for growth, which will focus on investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Our current primary internal research and development (“IR&D”) focus areas include satellite communications and signal monitoring, unmanned systems, and electronic products.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the intellectual skills of our employees and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
As of December 31, 2017, we held a number of U.S. and foreign patents. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. We will continue to file and pursue patent applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. 
We own or have rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. Certain of our trademarks have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various government regulations, including various U.S. Government regulations as a contractor and subcontractor to the agencies of the U.S. Government. Among the most significant U.S. Government regulations affecting our business are:

• | the Federal Acquisition Regulations and supplemental agency regulations, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance under government contracts;


• | the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;


• | the Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under cost-based government contracts;


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from providing anything of value to a foreign official to help obtain, retain or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantages;


• | the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which, respectively, impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false facts provided to the government and impose penalties on the basis of false statements, even if they do not result in a payment; and


• | laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.

We also need special security clearances to continue working on and advancing certain of our programs and contracts with the U.S. Government. Classified programs generally will require that we comply with various Executive Orders, federal laws and regulations and customer security requirements that may include restrictions on how we develop, store, protect and share information, and may require our employees to obtain government clearances.
The nature of the work we do for the federal government may also limit the parties who may invest in or acquire us. Export laws may keep us from providing potential foreign acquirers with a review of the technical data they would be acquiring. In addition, there are special requirements for foreign parties who wish to buy or acquire control or influence over companies that control technology or produce goods in the security interests of the U.S. There may need to be a review under the Exon-Florio provisions of the Defense Production Act. Finally, the government may require a prospective foreign owner to establish intermediaries to actually run that part of the company that does classified work, and establishing a subsidiary and its separate operation may make such an acquisition less appealing to such potential acquirers.
In addition, the export from the U.S. of certain of our products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations as kept in force 
11

by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, as amended. Some of our products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act and its implementing regulations, which licenses are generally harder to obtain and take longer to obtain than do Export Administration Act licenses.
Our business may require compliance with state or local laws designed to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies.
Material Availability
We procure critical material, components, products and subsystems from both domestic and global supply partners. These supply sources may be single sources for certain components and the material provided may have extended lead times. To support our continuing customer needs, we have taken steps to mitigate sourcing risks. This includes working closely with our suppliers to ensure future material and subsystem availability to support our manufacturing plans. In some cases, we have elected to stock reserve material to ensure future availability.
Environmental
Our manufacturing operations are subject to many requirements under environmental laws. In the U.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants in the ground. Violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration. The failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions. Most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law. U.S. laws also allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations. Outside the U.S., the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome. We have management programs and processes in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violations of these laws.
Other environmental laws, primarily in the U.S., address the contamination of land and groundwater and require the clean-up of such contamination. These laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on-going business, but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator. In addition, if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a hazardous substance, such as through its historic use as a disposal site, any person or company that has contributed to that contamination, whether or not it has a legal interest in the land, may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel.
