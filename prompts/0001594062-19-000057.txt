As part of its plan, on December 30, 2009, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Zhongshan Guangsheng Industry Co., Ltd., of China ("Zhongshan"), the manufacturer of the tankless water heaters.   Zhongshan manufactures the tankless water heaters under the brand Gleamous Electric Appliances.

 Current Business and Strategy
 
Our business has commenced generating modest revenues subsequent to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and up to the period ended October 31, 2018, when the initial phase of our beta revenue model testing were complete. We continue to build both consumer and enterprise technology, consumer package goods, invest in research & development and advertising to consumer and professional traffic for both our apps and web properties, as well as the marketing of our financial services partnership through AFN and its next stage development. Once we have gained a large enough audience the Company will begin to aggressively monetize its audience relationships through: 1) paid advertisements from businesses seeking exposure to users of the Herbo platform; 2) enterprise license agreements with professional customers; 3) sales of products targeting general health and wellness and alternative medicines and 4) successful marketing of our financial services to an expanded number of clients across various states in the US through our AFN partnership. Our 2018 acquisition of Ga-Du and the aforementioned marketing agreement with AFN will allow us to offer certain financial and marketing services to businesses and individuals, including the Cannabis Industry, on a programmatic or membership basis (the "Financial Program"), from which AFN and Ga-Du derive fees and income from enrolling companies in the Financial Program and providing a range of services to our clients (the "Members") according to the AFN pricing schedule (the "Fees").  Under our agreements, Ga-Du was granted the exclusive right to undertake marketing responsibilities of Alliance's Financial Services to businesses in the Cannabis industry, initially in Michigan, Oregon and Washington, and subsequently, Colorado, with plans to extend throughout the United States, provided that it shall not extend to any states where Cannabis sales have not been legalized by that state's laws.  Alliance and Ga-Du recently commenced business in the States of Florida, Montana, and Pennsylvania.  Ga-Du is credited with all Cannabis related members and revenues that use Alliance's financial and marketing services, regardless of the source of revenue, or the party that enrolled the customer that generated the revenues, that are generated within any territory in which Ga-Du has commenced business. This business segment was beta tested in fiscal 2019, and allowed us to start generating fee based revenue subsequent to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and up to October 31, 2018.Thereafter revenue generating operations under the terms of the agreement with AFN were suspended pending expansion of a banking relationship by eXPOTM in order to allow next stage transactional volume growth.

The Company's Herbo apps, Fitrix app, UseHerbo.com and "The Pursuit of Fine Herb" original content also remain available for use, either through Apple and Google app stores or online through a web-browser or through social channels, such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. During fiscal 2019, and particularly during the 4th quarter, the Company has focused its attention on the enhancement of its Herbo enterprise software package.
 
According to the popular traffic measuring site in 2018, Alexa, an Amazon.com Company, the useherbo.com domain is ranked 39,310 globally and 3,498 in the United States. The Herbo apps through the play stores or direct download to our beta users have an install base of over 50,000 users. The Fitrix app through the play stores or direct download to our beta users has an install base of approximately 22,500 users.
 
All current advertisers on the Herbo platform continue to be allowed to advertise at no charge. We have elected to pursue this strategy to allow for a concrete set of metrics to develop. Once these metrics have been developed, we will be properly prepared to set fair market advertising rates aligned with the media value of our audience. Management believes this "customer first" will benefit the success of retention and advertiser growth on a long-term basis.
 
While we have listed products for sale on the useherbo.com platform, we are simply redirecting users to other sites in where the product can be purchased. Currently, the Company is investing in our internal enterprise capabilities that will allow for us to best service, deliver and account for all transactions. Again, our driving focus is never to disappoint a customer with a poor experience, so we are taking a slower approach to ensure that all enterprise systems and logistics are perfected before we begin monetizing our audience. During fiscal 2019 we expended over $350,000 with third parties in respect of the ongoing development of software to support our platform,
 
The following is to provide a road-map for how the Company intends to commence and generate revenue from its app and enterprise software portfolio, further enhance revenue generated from our marketing agreement and set out the anticipated costs to do so. Eco Science Solutions' core Initiatives remain centered on five main areas: 1) continued consumer and enterprise technology investment, 2) continued product development through Scientific Research and Development; 3) inventory build for distribution, and 4) strategic acquisitions that provide an accelerated time-frame to secure market share; 5) development of Sales, Customer and Finance personnel depth to support accelerated revenue growth in all areas, including under our LMMA.
 
Technology investment – Eco Science Solutions will continue to make investments in both e-commerce and mobile applications that facilitate B2C e-commerce opportunities.   The Company's technology investments are centered on our platform that matches and connects consumers with desired products and/or providers, as well as providing for a convenient payment solution.  Additionally, the Company is launching a turn-key Business to Business, Customer Resource Management System (B2B CRM) marketing solution to support health, wellness and alternative medicine businesses with their on-going efforts to market, attract, acquire and retain customers. The Company will expend amounts management deems appropriate to continue to enhance technology development over the coming 12 months as may be required.
 
Scientific Research and Development investment – Eco Science Solutions has engaged in the development of DNA testing protocols for the purpose of evaluating a consumer's physical and mental needs. This continued investment effort will provide for a person by person mapping platform to best match the most suitable cannabis-related and/or dietary supplement products per ailment, thus maximizing the results of natural medication. The Company has budgeted up to $1 million for investment purposes in Scientific Research and Development investment at a future date.
 
Product formulation, inventory build and distribution – As Eco Science Solutions continues to accumulate data through its e-commerce and marketing solutions, the Company is in the process of development and distribution of unique products that include cannabis-related ingredients for alternative health and wellness interests. The Company has budgeted $1.25 million for investment purposes in Product development, inventory build and distribution at a future date.
  10
 

Strategic acquisitions – Due to various hyper-growth trends in segments of the holistic health and wellness category, Eco Science Solutions believes that it will be presented with unique investment and acquisition opportunities that are both synergistic and accretive to the Company. The Management Team has already identified several candidates. The Company has not budgeted an exact dollar amount for investment purposes in Strategic acquisitions over the next 12-month period as we are working to secure additional financing for our ongoing operations.
 
Sales, Customer and Finance personnel development - Additionally, the Company has budgeted up to $2 million for general working capital purposes, including the development of personnel and internal systems to support them in future periods. To date during this past year, the Company has relied heavily on loans from related parties to fund our ongoing operations.  These anticipated working capital costs include our current management team who have been accruing fees for their ongoing services.
 
The Company has also budgeted $1.5 million in marketing and advertising investment for next 12-month period, to support the Eco Science Solutions, Herbo and Fitrix brands as well as our efforts under our marketing agreement with AFN as needed during 2020.
 
It is anticipated by Management, that all of the above business segments and operations, along with additional investment where required, when fully implemented, will allow us to commence consistent revenue generating operations, and out goal is to accomplish these tasks during fiscal 2020.
 
Operations of Ga-Du and the License and Master Marketing Agreement (LMMA)
 
Operations of Ga-Du
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Ga-Du, acquired in June 2017, offers the following suite of business functions and opportunities:
 
Financial Services Platform Summary
 
Ga-Du has developed multiple financial services applications.  It has created a software platform that captures individual and business entity data. Ga-Du platform is a secure portal for account access and features incorporating current banking standards for operating and securing online data.  In terms of Financial Services, the Ga-Du platform uses a strict and proprietary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process, this ensures compliance regardless of the underlying usage.  This software can be used for membership capture, registrations of various kinds, for customer accounts retention and marketing, and/or for bank accounts.  In addition, the Ga-Du banking platform has been enhanced for mobile devices.  The mobile payment platform accommodates the purchasing of products and services like those offered by ESSI, and/or a combined entity, as well as other products and services both inside and outside the cannabis industry.  By targeting digital customers rather than brick-and-mortar customers, the digital Ga-Du platform acquired by ESSI is ready to provide banking services to any underserved area.
Inventory Control and Advisory Systems Business Summary
 
Retail marijuana is arguably the fastest growing segment of the cannabis industry. National monthly sales numbers seem to demonstrate, average year-over-year increases of over 100% for some years following legalization.  However, cannabis retailers still face hurdles finding working capital due to the federal regulation of cannabis as a Schedule I drug.  This lack of capital results in a potential market disruption opportunity.  Because businesses have not had financial resources to develop their own effective business solutions of various kinds, they represent potential "soft targets" for Ga-Du software and enterprise processes for inventory control and other services.  ESSI, through its acquisition of Ga-Du Corporation, will make available its Ga-Du solutions, advisory services, and inventory control systems (from raw materials to finished product) directly to licensed retail businesses, as well as work-flow analysis and management. Ga-Du has an experienced retail management team which has put in place similar as well as other services systems and processes for inventory acquisition and control.   These systems and processes can be licensed to regulate marijuana retail businesses potentially, allowing the retail business to focus on the customer experience while letting ESSI provide the backend technology and systems. The Ga-Du Management team believes that combining the business customer network of ESSI with the technology and systems that Ga-Du has assembled, in a manner that can allow retail businesses rapid access to cutting-edge technology and retail-marijuana-specific inventory control solutions, may provide ESSI with an edge in the rapidly expanding area of cannabis advisory/business services.

We recently completed a beta program whereby we generated revenues between May and October 2018 under this business segment and while presently modest, we expect this segment to be the leading revenue stream in the Company's portfolio once the program is fully launched.  Presently AFN has suspended the program, pending expansion of a banking relationship by eXPOTM in order to allow next stage transactional volume growth.  During the beta phase of the testing, Alliance reported the following results: (1) Cumulative eXPOTM Credit Exchange (through October 31, 2018) on a 1 for 1 cash to credit basis:  $ 24,365,025 (2) Cumulative Cash Pick-Ups (through October 31, 2018): $11,546,079; and (3) Total Revenue (through October 31, 2018): $284,310.

This market is extremely competitive and characterized by well-funded existing players, high capital inflows, and rapidly changing technologies. In addition to competitive and technological challenges, participants in the social media industry must remain flexible enough to accommodate changes in consumer preferences and tastes.

The Department of Justice governs the use of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Schedule 21 of the U.S. Code includes five established schedules of controlled substances known as schedules I, II, III, IV, and V. The Department of Justice has mandated that schedules established by this section shall be updated and republished on a semi-annual basis during the two-year period beginning one year after October 27, 1970 and shall be updated and republished on an annual basis thereafter. Schedule I includes cannabis in its listing. Substances included in Schedule I have the following characteristics:
 
(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse;
 (B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States;
 (C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.
 We do not produce, market, or sell cannabis.  We are limiting ourselves to states where the state law allows for the production of cannabis. Beyond the state law allowing for cannabis production our construction must comply with all state and local building requirements as well as zoning requirements.  We work closely with the local authorities regarding zoning and work closely with the local building inspectors to comply in every way with building regulations.
 
The domestic recognized cannabis industry is estimated to be over $44 Billion in revenues opportunity over the next several years, with double-digit growth estimated for the foreseeable future.

The budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation.  It is estimated that for every $1 spent on medical and recreational cannabis, there is an infusion of approximately $2.60 to the local economy, which is termed the "marijuana multiplier" effect. With the current Administration hyper-focused on growing domestic job opportunities, the Company believes that the cannabis movement will be a boon for creating such job opportunities.
 
Eco Science Solutions, Inc. has no control of the legislative environment, while Management believes that the cannabis and cannabis related markets will only become more main-stream, it is important to indicate that the removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the most tightly restricted category reserved for drugs that have "no currently accepted medical use," has been proposed repeatedly since 1972 and has not been granted.
 
Rescheduling proponents argue that cannabis does not meet the Controlled Substances Act's strict criteria for placement in Schedule I and so the government is required by law to permit medical use or to remove the drug from federal control altogether. The US government, on the other hand, maintains that cannabis is dangerous enough to merit Schedule I status. The dispute is based on differing views on both how the Act should be interpreted and what kinds of scientific evidence are most relevant to the rescheduling decision.
 
The Act provides a process for rescheduling controlled substances by petitioning the Drug Enforcement Administration. The first petition under this process was filed in 1972 to allow cannabis to be legally prescribed by physicians. The petition was ultimately denied after 22 years of court challenges, but a pill form of cannabis's psychoactive ingredient, THC, was rescheduled in 1985 to allow prescription under schedule II. In 1999, it was again rescheduled to allow prescription under schedule III.
 
A second petition, based on claims related to clinical studies, was denied in 2001. The most recent rescheduling petition filed by medical cannabis advocates was in 2002, but it was denied by the DEA in July 2011. Subsequently, medical cannabis advocacy group Americans for Safe Access filed an appeal, Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration in January 2012 with the District of Columbia Circuit, which was heard on 16 October 2012 and denied on 22 January 2013.
 
Currently, the FDA is conducting an analysis, at the request of the DEA, on whether marijuana should be downgraded, said Douglas Throckmorton, Deputy Director for Regulatory Programs at the FDA, at a congressional hearing in June 2014. In August 2016, the DEA reaffirmed its position and refused to remove Schedule I classification. However, the DEA announced that it will end restrictions on the supply of marijuana to researchers and drug companies that had previously only been available from the government's own facility at the University of Mississippi.
 
On January 4, 2018 the office of the Attorney General published a memo regarding Marijuana Enforcement that rescinds Obama-era directives easing federal enforcement. While marijuana has always been illegal under federal law, as noted above, certain states have legalized adult usage under various local laws which govern substance usage and limits. In the January 8, 2018 memo, Jefferson B. Sessions, Attorney General has indicated enforcement decisions will be left up to the U.S. Attorney's in the respective States clearly indicating that the burden is with "federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute by weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of federal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community."
 The Company does not believe this directive will have a substantive impact on its planned operations.
 
On April 13, 2018 it was announced that President Donald Trump had promised Senate Republican Cory Gardner that he will support congressional efforts to protect states that have legalized marijuana, defusing a months-long standoff between Sen. Cory Gardner and the administration over Justice Department nominees. Trump told Gardner that despite the DOJ memo of January 4, 2018, the marijuana industry in Colorado will not be targeted. A bill has not been finalized, but discussion has commenced to find legislation that would, in effect, make clear the federal government cannot interfere with states that have voted to legalize marijuana.(1)
