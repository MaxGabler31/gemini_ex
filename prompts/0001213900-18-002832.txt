ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Zion Oil and Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of 18 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. We were incorporated in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed our initial public offering in January 2007. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ZN” and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol “ZNWAA.”
 
Zion currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License, comprising approximately 99,000 acres. In December 2016, Zion and a local Israeli construction company signed a contract for the civil works and drill site construction at the Megiddo-Jezreel #1 (“MJ #1”) location. The site was completed in early March 2017. The drilling rig and associated equipment were mobilized to the site, performance and endurance tested, and the MJ #1 exploratory well was spud on June 5, 2017, ahead of the June 30, 2017 deadline under the then-existing license terms. The MJ #1 well has been drilled to a total depth (“TD”) of 5,060 meters (approximately 16,600 feet). Zion also successfully obtained three open-hole wireline log suites (including a formation image log). The well has also been cased and cemented in preparation for upcoming testing of multiple zones of interest, including zone(s) where free-flowing hydrocarbons were collected after circulating mud in the borehole. Following review of the open-hole logs, we will finalize the testing program, which is planned to commence in the second quarter of 2018. Zion has encountered movable oil and gas in the well’s drilling mud. However, as of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we are not able to confirm whether the well will be commercially productive and will not be able to do so until after testing and evaluating of the MJ#1 well is complete.
 
Depending on the final outcome and results of the currently active MJ#1 well and having adequate cash resources, multiple wells could be drilled from this pad site as several subsurface geologic targets can be reached using directional well trajectories.
 
At present, we have no revenues or operating income. Our ability to generate future revenues and operating cash flow will depend on the successful exploration and exploitation of our current and any future petroleum rights or the acquisition of oil and/or gas producing properties, and the volume and timing of such production. In addition, even if we are successful in producing oil and gas in commercial quantities, our results will depend upon commodity prices for oil and gas, as well as operating expenses including taxes and royalties.
 
Our executive offices are located at 12655 North Central Expressway, Suite 1000, Dallas, Texas 75243, and our telephone number is (214) 221-4610. Our branch office’s address in Israel is 9 Halamish Street, North Industrial Park, Caesarea 3088900, and the telephone number is +972-4-623-8500. Our website address is: www.zionoil.com.
 
Company Background
 
In 1983, during a visit to Israel, John M. Brown (our Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors) became inspired and dedicated to finding oil and gas in Israel. During the next 17 years he made several trips each year to Israel, hired oil and gas consultants in Israel and Texas, met with Israeli government officials, made direct investments with local exploration companies, and assisted Israeli exploration companies in raising money for oil and gas exploration in Israel. This activity led Mr. Brown to form Zion Oil & Gas, Inc. in April 2000, in order to receive the award of a small onshore petroleum license from the Israeli government.
 
Zion’s vision, as guided by John Brown, of finding oil and/or natural gas in Israel, is biblically inspired. The vision is based, in part, on biblical references alluding to the presence of oil and/or natural gas in territories within the State of Israel that were formerly within certain ancient biblical tribal areas. While John Brown provides the broad vision and goals for our company, the actions taken by the Zion Board of Directors and management team as it actively explores for oil and gas in Israel, are based on modern science and good business practice. Zion’s oil and gas exploration activities are supported by appropriate geological, geophysical and other science-based studies and surveys typically carried out by companies engaged in oil and gas exploration activities.
 
Upon the award of our first petroleum right in May 2000, the Israeli government provided us access to most of its data with respect to previous exploration in the area, including geologic reports, seismic records and profiles, drilling reports, well files, gravity surveys, geochemical surveys and regional maps. We also gathered information concerning prior and ongoing geological, geophysical and drilling activity relevant to our planned activities from a variety of publicly accessible sources. Subsequently, we have acquired additional studies on our own such as seismic and other geophysical and geological surveys.

ZION’S CURRENT EXPLORATION LICENSE AREA
 
Zion currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License (covering an area of approximately 99,000 acres – See Map 1). Under Israeli law, Zion has an exclusive right to oil and gas exploration in our license area in that no other company may drill there. In the event we drill an oil or gas discovery in our license area, current Israeli law entitles us to convert the relevant portions of our license to a 30-year production lease, extendable to 50 years, subject to compliance with a field development work program and production.

Summary of Current and Former Company License Areas
 
Megiddo-Jezreel Petroleum License
 
The MJL was awarded on December 3, 2013 for a three-year primary term through December 2, 2016, with the possibility of additional one-year extensions up to an aggregate maximum of seven years. The MJL is onshore, south and west of the Sea of Galilee and the Company continues its exploration focus here as it appears to possess the key geologic ingredients of an active petroleum system with significant exploration potential. In late November 2016, The State of Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner officially approved Zion’s drilling date and license extension request.


On October 30, 2017, Zion sought a multi-year extension to its existing license. After receiving feedback from Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner, Zion submitted a revised extension request on November 9, 2017. On November 20, 2017, Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner officially approved Zion’s multi-year extension request on its Megiddo-Jezreel License No. 401, extending its validity to December 2, 2019. The Company now remains subject to the following updated key license terms:



Number | Activity Description | Execution by:
-------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------
1 | Submit final report on the results of drilling | 31 May 2018 
2 | Submit program for continuation of work under license | 30 June 2018 

Zion’s Former Jordan Valley, Asher-Menashe and Joseph Licenses
 
On March 29, 2015, the Energy Ministry formally approved the Company’s application to merge the southernmost portion of the Jordan Valley License into the Megiddo-Jezreel License. The Company has plugged all of its exploratory wells (in the former Joseph and Asher-Menashe License areas) but acknowledges its obligation to complete the abandonment of these well sites in accordance with guidance from the Environmental Ministry and local officials (see note 10B). 
Exploration Plans Going Forward
 
Zion currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License, comprising approximately 99,000 acres. In December 2016, Zion and a local Israeli construction company signed a contract for the civil works and drill site construction at the Megiddo-Jezreel #1 (“MJ #1”) location. The site was completed in early March 2017. The drilling rig and associated equipment were mobilized to the site, performance and endurance tested, and the MJ #1 exploratory well was spud on June 5, 2017, ahead of the June 30, 2017 deadline under the then-existing license terms. The MJ #1 well has been drilled to a total depth (“TD”) of 5,060 meters (approximately 16,600 feet). Zion also successfully obtained three open-hole wireline log suites (including a formation image log). The well has also been cased and cemented in preparation for upcoming testing of multiple zones of interest, including zone(s) where free-flowing hydrocarbons were collected after circulating mud in the borehole. Following review of the open-hole logs, we will finalize the testing program, which is planned to commence in the second quarter of 2018. However, as of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we are not able to confirm whether the well will be commercially productive and will not be able to do so until after testing and evaluating the MJ#1 well in Q2 2018.
 
Depending on the final outcome and results of the currently active MJ #1 well and having adequate cash resources, multiple wells could be drilled from this pad site as several subsurface geologic targets are reachable using directional well trajectories.
 
We continue our exploration focus on our Megiddo-Jezreel License area as that area appears to possess the key geologic ingredients of an active petroleum system.

Employees & Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 28 employees and contractors of whom all but six are on a full-time basis. Included in this number are certain contractors who provide services to Zion on an ongoing basis. Of the 28 total headcount, 18 work out of our Dallas office and 10 work out of the Caesarea, Israel office. None of our current employees or contractors are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and there have been no strikes.
 
We regularly utilize independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly for services connected to drilling operations, such as specialized drilling, health and safety, engineering, logging, cementing and well-testing.
 
Competition and Markets

The oil and gas exploration industry in Israel currently consists of a number of exploration companies. These include relatively small local or foreign companies (such as Zion Oil & Gas, Genie Oil & Gas/Afek, and Givot Olam), as well as larger consortia of local Israeli and foreign participants (Noble Energy Inc./Delek Group Ltd.). Most groups are engaged primarily in offshore activities, which is not an area in which we are currently active. So long as we hold our current license, Israeli law conveys an exclusive exploration right to Zion such that no additional companies may compete in our license area.
 
Historically, primarily for geopolitical reasons, Israel (particularly onshore) has not been an area of interest for international integrated or large or mid-size independent oil and gas exploration companies. Since the announcement of the Tamar and Leviathan discoveries, this situation has changed somewhat. Limited availability in Israel of oil field service companies, equipment and personnel continues to present obstacles, especially during periods of decreased activity and risk aversion in the current market. We attempt to enhance our position by developing and maintaining good professional relations with oil field service providers and by demonstrating a high level of credibility in making and meeting commercial commitments.
 
The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and from time to time there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies can vary greatly. If the unavailability or high cost of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel was particularly severe in the areas where we operate, we could be materially and adversely affected. We will continue to monitor the market and build service provider relationships in order to help mitigate concentration risk.
 
If any of our exploratory wells are commercially productive, we would install the appropriate production equipment which includes, among other items, oil and gas separation facilities and storage tanks. Under the terms of the Petroleum Law, we may be required by the Minister of Energy and Water Resources to offer first refusal for any oil and gas discovered to Israeli domestic purchasers at market prices.

Since Israel imports almost all of its crude oil needs and the market for crude oil in Israel is limited to two local oil refineries, no special marketing strategy needs to be adopted initially with regard to any oil that we may ultimately discover. We believe that we would have a ready local market for our oil at market prices in addition to having the option of exporting to the international market, if any of our future exploratory wells are commercially productive.
 
Israel’s Petroleum Law
 
Our business in Israel is subject to regulation by the State of Israel under the Petroleum Law. The administration and implementation of the Petroleum Law are vested in the Minister of Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources (“Energy Minister”), the Petroleum Commissioner and an advisory council. The following discussion includes a brief summary review of certain provisions of the Petroleum Law as currently in effect. This review is not complete, and it should not be relied on as a definitive restatement of the law related to petroleum exploration and production activities in Israel.
 
Petroleum resources are owned by the State of Israel, regardless of whether they are located on state lands or the offshore continental shelf. No person is allowed to explore for or produce petroleum without being granted a specific right under the Petroleum Law.
 
License. The “license” is a petroleum exploration right, bestowing an exclusive right for further exploration work and requiring the drilling of one or more test wells. The initial term of a license is up to three years, and it may be extended for up to an additional four years (in one year increments). A license area may not exceed 400,000 dunams (approximately 98,842 acres). One dunam is equal to 1,000 square meters (approximately 0.24711 of an acre). No one entity may hold more than 12 licenses or hold more than a total of four million dunam in aggregate license area.
 
Production lease. Upon discovery of petroleum in commercial quantities, a licensee has a statutory “right” to receive a production “lease.” The initial lease term is 30 years, extendable for an additional 20 years (up to a maximum period of 50 years). A lease confers upon the lessee the exclusive right to explore for and produce petroleum in the lease area and requires the lessee to produce petroleum in commercial quantities (or pursue test or development drilling). The lessee is entitled to transport and market the petroleum produced, subject, however, to the right of the government to require the lessee to supply local needs first, at market price.
 
Petroleum rights fees. The holders of licenses and leases are required to pay fees to the government of Israel to maintain the rights. The fees vary according to the nature of the right, the size and location (onshore or offshore) of the right, acreage subject to the right and, in the case of a license, the period during which the license has been maintained. Every subsequent year, the license fee increases incrementally.
 
Requirements and entitlements of holders of petroleum rights. The holder of a petroleum right (license or lease) is required to conduct its operations in accordance with a work program set as part of the petroleum right, with due diligence and in accordance with the accepted practice in the petroleum industry. The holder is required to submit progress and final reports; provided, however, the information disclosed in such reports remains confidential for as long as the holder owns a petroleum right on the area concerned.
 
If the holder of a petroleum right does not comply with the work program provided by the terms of the right, the Petroleum Commissioner may issue a notice requiring that the holder cure the default within 60 days of the giving of the notice, together with a warning that failure to comply within the 60-day cure period may entail cancellation of the right. If the petroleum right is cancelled following such notice, the holder of the right may, within 30 days of the date of notice of the Commissioner’s decision, appeal such cancellation to the Energy Minister. No petroleum right shall be cancelled until the Energy Minister has ruled on the appeal.
 
We are obligated, according to the Petroleum Law, to pay royalties to the Government of Israel on the gross production of oil and gas from the oil and gas properties of Zion located in Israel (excluding those reserves serving to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities). The royalty rate stated in the Petroleum Law is 12.5% of the produced reserves. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any outstanding obligation with respect to royalty payments, since it is in the development stage and, to this date, no proved reserves have been found.

In March 2011, the Israeli parliament enacted the Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, which imposes a new levy on oil and gas production. Under the new tax regime, the Israeli Government repealed the percentage depletion deduction and imposed a levy at an initial rate of 20% on profits from oil and gas which will gradually rise to 45.52% for 2016 onwards, depending on the levy coefficient (the R-Factor). The R-Factor refers to the percentage of the amount invested in the exploration, the development and the establishment of the project, so that the 20% rate will be imposed only after a recovery of 150% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 1.5) and will range linearly up to 45.52% after a recovery of 230% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 2.3). For purposes of the levy rate calculation, the minimal gas sale price that will be accepted by the State is the bi-annual average local price. The present 12.5% royalty imposed on oil revenues remains unchanged.
 
The grant of a petroleum right does not automatically entitle its holder to enter upon the land to which the right applies or to carry out exploration and production work thereon. Entry requires the consent of the private or public holders of the surface rights and of other public regulatory bodies (e.g. planning and building authorities, Nature Reserves Authority, municipal and security authorities, etc.). The holder of a petroleum right may request the government to acquire, on its behalf, land needed for petroleum purposes. The petroleum right holder is required to obtain all other necessary approvals.
 
Petroleum Taxation. Our activities in Israel will be subject to taxation both in Israel and in the United States. Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, we will be entitled to claim either a deduction or a foreign tax credit with respect to Israeli income taxes paid or incurred on our Israeli source oil and gas income. As a general rule, we anticipate that it will be more advantageous for us to claim a credit rather than a deduction for applicable Israeli income taxes on our U.S tax return. A tax treaty exists between the U.S. and Israel that would provide opportunity to use the tax credit.
 
Exploration and development expenses. Under current US and Israeli tax laws, exploration and development expenses incurred by a holder of a petroleum right can, at the option of such holder, either be expensed in the year incurred or capitalized and expensed (or amortized) over a period of years. Most of our expenses to date have been expensed for both U.S. and Israeli income tax purposes.
 
Depletion allowances. Until 2011, the holder of an interest in a petroleum license or lease was allowed a deduction for income tax purposes on account of the depletion of the petroleum reserve relating to such interest. This may have been by way of percentage depletion or cost depletion, whichever is greater. In 2010, the Finance Minister of Israel established an advisory committee to study the country’s fiscal policy as it relates to the upstream oil and natural gas sector, as well as various options, including an increase in royalties or cancellation of tax incentives. In January 2011, the Finance Ministry advisory committee issued its final recommendations which included cancellation of currently existing tax incentives, including the depletion allowance. In 2011, the depletion allowance was abolished.
 
Corporate tax. Under current Israeli tax laws, whether a company is registered in Israel or is a foreign company operating in Israel through a branch, it is subject to Israeli Companies Tax on its taxable income (including capital gains) from Israeli sources at a rate of 24%, effective January 1, 2017, and at a flat rate of 23%, effective January 1, 2018.
 
Import duties. Insofar as similar items are not available in Israel, the Petroleum Law provides that the owner of a petroleum right may import into Israel, free of most customs, purchase taxes and other import duties, all machinery, equipment, installations, fuel, structures, transport facilities, etc. (apart from consumer goods and private cars and similar vehicles) that are required for the petroleum exploration and production purposes, subject to the requirement that security be provided to ensure that the equipment is exported out of Israel within the agreed upon time frame.
 
Israeli Energy Related Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries or other agencies of Israel, each having jurisdiction over certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws.

The Onshore Petroleum Exploration Permitting Process in Israel

The permitting process in Israel with respect to petroleum exploration continues to undergo significant modification, the result of which is to considerably increase the complexity, time period, and expenditures needed to obtain the necessary permits to undertake exploratory drilling once a drilling prospect has been identified. Applications for new exploration licenses need to comply with more demanding requirements relating to a license applicant’s financial capability, experience and access to experienced personnel. Various guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner and Energy and Environmental Ministries since 2012 as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention of these guidelines was included in previous Zion Oil & Gas filings.
 
On May 16, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for the preparation and submission of a drilling program in accordance with industry best practices or “Good Oilfield Practice.”
 
On May 17, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for production testing in accordance with “Good Industry Practice” detailing the applicable measures and reporting requirements.
 
On December 28, 2017, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for the formal approval by the Commissioner of the discovery of a petroleum field capable of producing commercial quantities of petroleum. The guidelines detail the applicable petroleum discovery application requirements including submission of a conceptual field development plan.
 
We believe that these new regulations will significantly increase the expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights and drilling new wells, coupled with the heavy financial burden of “locking away” significant amounts of cash that could otherwise be used for operational purposes. Finally, this will also considerably increase the time needed to obtain all of the necessary authorizations and approvals prior to drilling. 
 
Environmental & Safety / Planning & Building

Oil and gas drilling operations could potentially harm the environment if there are polluting spills caused by the loss of well control.  The Petroleum Law and regulations provide that the conduct of petroleum exploration and drilling operations be pursued in compliance with “good oil field practices” and that measures of due care be taken to avoid seepage of oil, gas and well fluids into the ground and from one geologic formation to another. The Petroleum Law and regulations also require that, upon the abandonment of a well, it be adequately plugged and marked. Recently, as a condition for issuing the required permit for the construction of a drilling site, the planning commissions have required the submission of a site remediation plan, subject to approval of the environmental authorities.  Our operations are also subject to claims for personal injury and property damage caused by the release of chemicals or petroleum substances by us or others in connection with the conduct of petroleum operations on our behalf. Various guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner and Energy and Environmental Ministries since 2012 as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention of these guidelines was included in previous Zion Oil & Gas filings.

On January 21, 2016, the Environmental Ministry published Professional Guidelines and Standards for Remediation of Land. The guidelines clarify and define what is considered polluted land, remediation and the permitted methods to remediate polluted land, and it applies to oil and gas exploration companies including Zion.
 
On June 28, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for occupational health and safety practices regarding oil and gas drilling and production activities per international norms, coupled with Israeli legal safety guidelines. These regulations focus on industry best practices in the area of health, safety, and environmental (HS&E) factors as well as risk management. In addition, there is a new requirement to have the Petroleum Commissioner’s approval over the safety standards which the operator seeks to apply.
 
We do not know and cannot predict whether any new legislation in this area will be enacted and, if so, in what form and which of its provisions, if any, will relate to and affect our activities, how and to what extent or what impact, if any, it might have on our financial statements. There are no known proceedings instituted by governmental authorities, pending or known to be contemplated against us under any environmental laws. We are not aware of any events of noncompliance in our operations in connection with any environmental laws or regulations. However, we cannot predict whether any new or amended environmental laws or regulations introduced in the future will have a material adverse effect on our future business.
 
The Company believes that these new and/or revised regulations will significantly increase the complexity, time, and expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights, drilling, and plugging/abandoning new wells, coupled with the heavy financial burden of “locking away” significant amounts of cash that could otherwise be used for operational purposes.
 
Political Climate
 
We are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Specifically, we could be adversely affected by:
 

● | any major hostilities involving Israel; 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the Israeli army; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel.

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Any ongoing or future violence between Israel and the Palestinians, armed conflicts, terrorist activities, tension along Israel’s borders, or political instability in the region could possibly disrupt international trading activities in Israel and may materially and negatively affect our business conditions and could harm our prospects and business.
 
Civil unrest could spread throughout the region or grow in intensity, leading to more regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the United States and Israel, civil wars, or regional conflict. More recently, Russia initiated significant and direct military intervention in Syria consisting of air strikes against ISIS and other parties. With ongoing operations by Russia, the U.S. and other countries in areas in close proximity to Israel, there is an increased risk of deliberate and/or inadvertent mishaps that could give rise to grave military and political consequences.
 
We cannot predict the effect, if any, on our business of renewed hostilities between Israel and its neighbors or any other changes in the political climate in the area.
 
Foundations
 
If we are successful in finding commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in Israel, 6% of our gross revenues from production will go to fund two charitable foundations that we established with the purpose of donating to charities in Israel, the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 
For charitable activities concerning Israel, the Bnei Joseph Foundation (R.A.) was established. On November 11, 2008, both the Articles of Association and Incorporation Certificate were certified by the Registrar of Amutot (i.e. Charitable Foundations) in Israel.
 
For the U.S. and worldwide charitable activities, the Abraham Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland was established.  On June 20, 2008, the Articles of Incorporation were executed and filed by the Swiss Notary in the Commercial Registrar in Geneva. On June 23, 2008, the initial organizational meeting of the founding members was convened in Israel.  Regulations for the Organization of the Abraham Foundation, signed by the founding members, were then filed with the Registrar.  On November 19, 2008, the Swiss Confederation approved the Foundation as an international foundation under the supervision of the federal government.  On December 8, 2008, the Republic of Geneva and the Federal government of Switzerland issued a tax ruling providing complete tax exemption for the Foundation.
 
Our shareholders, in a resolution passed at the 2002 Annual Meeting, gave authority to the Zion Board of Directors to transfer a 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the two foundations with regard to the Joseph and Asher-Menashe licenses.  In accordance with that resolution, we took steps to legally donate a 3% overriding royalty interest to the Bnei Joseph Foundation (in Israel) and a 3% overriding royalty interest to the Abraham Foundation (in Switzerland).
 
On June 22, 2009, we received an official letter from the Commissioner informing us that the 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the Bnei Joseph Foundation and the Abraham Foundation had been registered in the Israeli Oil Register with regard to the Joseph and Asher-Menashe licenses. On November 9, 2011, we received an official letter from the Commissioner informing us that the 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the Bnei Joseph Foundation and the Abraham Foundation had been registered in the Israeli Oil Register with regard to the Jordan Valley License.
 
On February 5, 2014, the Company submitted applications to the Petroleum Commissioner, requesting royalty interest transfers from the Megiddo-Jezreel License of 3% overriding royalties to the Bnei Joseph Amutot and the Abraham Foundation, respectively. On April 8, 2014, the transfers were approved by the Petroleum Commissioner and duly registered.
