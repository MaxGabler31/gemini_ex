ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 Overview   Glatfelter began operations in 1864, and we believe we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of specialty papers and engineered materials. We are headquartered in York, Pennsylvania, and we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the Philippines. In addition to many of our manufacturing locations, we have sales and distribution offices in the U.S., Russia and China. Our 13 manufacturing facilities have a combined production capacity of approximately 1.0 million tons of engineered materials and specialty papers products used in a wide array of applications. We manage our company as three separate business units: Composite Fibers; Advanced Airlaid Materials; and Specialty Papers.
 Strategy   Our strategy is focused on 

The following charts depict Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) by business unit for the year ended December 31, 2017.

  
Over the past few years, we have shifted more of our focus to developing our engineered materials businesses (Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials). We have expanded our position in growing global markets with approximately half of our net sales and three-quarters of Adjusted EBITDA coming from these two businesses. This expansion counterbalances the decline of demand in certain markets served by Specialty Papers. 
 In our growth businesses, we partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide innovative solutions delivering outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the market demands and grow our revenue. We are committed to growing in our key markets and will make appropriate investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands. For example, we invested approximately $85 million to build a new advanced airlaid facility in Arkansas to service the North America market. The new facility will provide approximately 22,000 short tons of capacity with commercial shipments anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2018. The investment increases our total global airlaid materials capacity to approximately 129,000 short tons. 
 New product development and new business development are critical components of our business. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we invested $10.3 million, $10.3 million and $10.4 million, respectively, in new product development activities. 
 We are committed to ensuring our cost structure is competitive and to maintaining our leading market positions, expanding product margins and generating strong free cash flows driven by delivering on cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives. In 2017, we implemented significant cost optimization initiatives in both Composite Fibers and Specialty Papers. Combined, the actions are delivering meaningful results. 
 Our investment in a global business system transformation will unify our processes and systems to

  improve our cost structure, facilitate global growth, empower employees, enable compliance and improve the customer experience. Advanced Airlaid Materials successfully completed implementation of a new manufacturing and business systems in North America during the fourth quarter of 2017 with implementation at our European site to follow in 2018.
 Acquisitions   Over the past several years, we have completed a number of acquisitions that have diversified our revenue, expanded our geographic footprint and enhanced our asset base. Our acquisition strategy is focused on targeting investments in adjacent or closely related markets and which complement our long-term strategy of driving growth in core markets. Since 2006, we have successfully completed six acquisitions demonstrating our ability to establish leading market positions through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary businesses.
 Business Units   We manage our company as three separate business units: Composite Fibers; Advanced Airlaid Materials; and Specialty Papers. Consolidated net sales and the relative net sales contribution of each of our business units for the past three years are summarized below:

Dollars in thousands | 2017 | | | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
------------------------------+------+-----------+---+------+---+-----------+------+--
Net sales | $ | 1,591,297 | | | $ | 1,604,797 | | $ | 1,661,084 |

Total | | 1,032,322 | | 1,045,121 | | 1,051,911

Composite Fibers   Our Composite Fibers business unit serves customers globally and focuses on higher value-added products in the following markets:
 
• | Food & Beverage filtration paper primarily used for single-serve coffee and tea products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wallcovering base materials used by the world’s largest wallpaper manufacturers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technical Specialties a diverse line of special paper products used in applications such as electrical energy storage, transport and transmission, wipes, and other highly-engineered fiber-based applications;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Metallized products used in labels, packaging liners, gift wrap, and other consumer product applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe Composite Fibers maintains a market leadership position in the single-serve coffee and tea markets, wallcover base material and many products it produces. This business unit’s revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
----------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Food & beverage | $ | 268,474 | | $ | 258,463 | | $ | 274,865
Wallcovering | | 103,011 | | | 90,767 | | | 91,620 
Technical specialties | | 76,991 | | | 71,558 | | | 71,689 
Composite laminates | | 38,696 | | | 35,107 | | | 34,897 
Metallized | | 57,088 | | | 61,059 | | | 68,397 
Total | $ | 544,260 | | $ | 516,954 | | $ | 541,468

 
A significant portion of this business unit’s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates favorably affected the comparison of 2017 to 2016 by $2.0 million and unfavorably affected the comparison of 2016 to 2015 by $11.1 million. 
 We believe many of the markets served by Composite Fibers present attractive growth opportunities due to evolving consumer preferences, new or emerging geographic markets, and increased market share through superior products and quality. We also believe growth opportunities exist as a result of new product innovations. Many of this business’ papers are extremely lightweight, technically sophisticated, require specialized fibers, and require specifically designed papermaking equipment and production processes. Our proven capability to produce these demanding products and our focus on customer relationships positions us well to compete in these global markets.
 The Composite Fibers business unit is comprised of five paper making facilities (Germany, France and England), two metallizing operations (Wales and Germany) and a pulp mill (the Philippines). The combined attributes of the facilities are summarized as follows:
 
 
Production Capacity (short tons) | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------
155,500 lightweight and other paper | Abaca pulp | | 15,300
 | Wood pulp | | 96,300
 | Synthetic fiber | | 24,400
24,000 metallized | Base stock | | 23,900
18,000 abaca pulp | Abaca fiber | | 22,700

  Composite Fibers’ lightweight products are produced using highly specialized inclined wire paper machine technology. We believe we currently maintain approximately 25% of the global inclined wire capacity.
 The primary raw materials used in the production of our lightweight papers are abaca pulp, wood pulp and synthetic fibers. Sufficient quantities of abaca pulp and its source abaca fiber are important to support growth in this business unit. Abaca pulp, a specialized pulp with limited sources of availability, is produced by our Philippine mill, providing a unique advantage to our Composite Fibers business unit. In the event the supply of abaca fiber becomes constrained or when production demands exceed the capacity of the Philippines mill, alternative sources and/or substitute fibers are used to meet customer demands.
 In addition to critical raw materials, Composite Fibers’ production cost is influenced by energy prices, particularly natural gas. The business unit generates all of its steam needed for production by burning natural gas. However, in 2017 it purchased approximately 75% of its electricity needs the cost of which is influenced by the natural gas markets.
 In Composite Fibers’ markets, competition is product line specific as the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing equipment limits the number of companies offering multiple product lines. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single serve coffee & tea | Ahlstrom, Purico, Miquel y Costas and Zhejiang Kan 
Wallcovering | Technocell, Neu Kaliss, Goznak, Kämmerer and Ahlstrom 
Composite laminates | Schweitzer-Maudit, Purico, Miquel y Costas and Oi Feng 
Metallized | AR Metallizing, Torras Papel Novelis, Vaassen, Galileo Nanotech, and Wenzhou Protec Vacuum Metallizing Co.

 
Our strategy in Composite Fibers is focused on:
 
• | capitalizing on growing global markets in food & beverage, wallcover, electrical products and consumer products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | making targeted investments to create incremental capacity to serve growth markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging innovation resources to drive new product and new business development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensuring readily available access to specialized raw material requirements to support projected growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Airlaid Materials Our Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit is a leading global supplier of highly absorbent cellulose-based airlaid nonwoven materials primarily used to manufacture consumer products for growing global end-user markets. The markets served by Advanced Airlaid Materials include:

• | feminine hygiene;
--+------------------


• | specialty wipes;
--+-----------------


• | adult incontinence;
--+--------------------


• | home care; and
--+---------------


• | other consumer products.
--+-------------------------

 Advanced Airlaid Materials serves customers who are industry leading consumer product companies as well as private label converters. We believe this business unit holds leading market share positions in many of the markets it serves. Advanced Airlaid Materials has developed long-term customer relationships through superior quality, customer service, and a reputation for quickly bringing product and process innovations to market.
 Advanced Airlaid Materials’ revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
-------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Feminine hygiene | $ | 179,670 | | $ | 173,902 | | $ | 182,048
Specialty wipes | | 29,519 | | | 25,206 | | | 22,950 
Adult incontinence | | 14,425 | | | 12,281 | | | 10,720 
Home care | | 13,029 | | | 12,630 | | | 13,345 
Other | | 19,458 | | | 20,243 | | | 15,526 
Total | $ | 256,101 | | $ | 244,262 | | $ | 244,589

 
A significant portion of this business unit’s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates unfavorably affected the comparison of 2017 to 2016 by $2.8 million. The effect of currency changes was minimal in 2016 compared with 2015.
 The feminine hygiene category accounted for 70% of Advanced Airlaid Material’s revenue in 2017. The majority of sales of this product are to a small group of large, leading global consumer products companies. These markets are considered to be more growth oriented due to population growth in certain geographic regions and changing consumer preferences. In developing regions, demand is also influenced by increases in disposable income and cultural preferences. 
 The Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit operates state-of-the-art facilities in Falkenhagen, Germany and Gatineau, Canada. The Falkenhagen location operates three multi-bonded production lines and three proprietary single-lane festooners. The Gatineau 


 
 
GLATFELTER 2017 FORM 10-K | 3

  location consists of two airlaid production lines employing multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies and two proprietary single-lane festooners. In addition, a new production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas with an annual capacity of approximately 22,000 short tons, will primarily serve the growing demand for wipes and hygiene airlaid products in North America.
 The business unit’s three facilities operate with the following combined attributes:
 
 
Airlaid Production Capacity (short tons) | | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
-----------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------
 | 129,000 | | Fluff pulp | | 98,560

 
In addition to the cost of critical raw materials, our cost to produce is impacted by energy. Advanced Airlaid Materials purchases substantially all of the electricity and natural gas used in its operations. Approximately 90% of this business unit’s revenue is earned under contracts with pass-through provisions directly related to the cost of key raw materials.
 Advanced Airlaid Materials continues to be a technology and product innovation leader in technically demanding segments of the airlaid market. This business unit’s airlaid material production employs multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies as opposed to other methods such as hydrogen-bonding. We believe that its facilities are among the most modern and flexible airlaid facilities in the world, allowing it to produce at industry leading operating rates. Its proprietary single-lane festooning technology provides converting and product packaging which supports efficiency optimization by the customers converting processes. This business unit’s in-house technical expertise, combined with significant capital investment requirements and rigorous customer expectations creates large barriers to entry for new competitors.
 The following summarizes this business unit’s key competitors:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
-----------------+------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This business unit produces both commodity products and higher-value-added specialty products. Specialty Papers’ revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
----------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Carbonless & forms | $ | 292,071 | | $ | 319,648 | | $ | 349,831
Engineered products | | 189,930 | | | 189,463 | | | 190,943
Envelope & converting | | 154,291 | | | 173,362 | | | 178,067

Total | $ | 790,935 | | $ | 843,582 | | $ | 875,026

 
Many of the market segments served by Specialty Papers are characterized by declining demand resulting in an industry with excess capacity, lower operating rates and pricing pressure. In addition, foreign producers create additional imbalance by shipping product to the U.S. when market pricing is favorable. In response, we and other producers have closed, reduced or repurposed production capacity in an attempt to bring supply balance to the market. In the third quarter of 2017, we permanently shut down a machine which represented approximately 10% of Specialty Papers’ annual production. Maintaining the supply and demand balance will require the industry to continually remove capacity sufficient to match declining demand.
 We have been successful at maintaining this business unit’s shipments by leveraging the flexibility of our assets base to respond to new product and new business development opportunities, efficiently responding to changing customer demands and delivering superior customer service.

  We are one of the leading suppliers of carbonless and book publishing papers in the United States. Although the markets for these products are declining, we have been successful in executing our strategy to offset, in large part, this lost volume with products such as envelope papers, business forms, and other value-added specialty engineered products. 
 Specialty Papers’ highly technical engineered products include high speed ink jet printing papers, office specialty products, greeting cards, packaging, casting, release, transfer, playing card, postal, FDA-compliant food and other niche specialty applications. Such products comprise an array of distinct business niches that are in a continuous state of evolution. Many of these products are utilized for demanding, specialized customer and end-user applications. Some of our products are new and higher growth while others are more mature and further along in the product life cycle. Because many of these products are technically complex and involve substantial customer-supplier development collaboration, they typically command higher per ton prices and generally exhibit greater pricing stability relative to commodity grade paper products.
 The Specialty Papers business unit operates two integrated pulp and paper making facilities with the following combined attributes:
 
 
Uncoated Production Capacity (short tons) | | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
------------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------
 | 735,000 | | Pulpwood | | 2,340,000
 | | | Wood- and other pulps | | 665,515 

 
This business unit’s pulp mills have a combined pulp making capacity of 620,000 tons of bleached pulp per year. The principal raw material used to produce pulp is pulpwood, including both hardwoods and softwoods. Pulpwood is obtained from a variety of locations including the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. To protect our sources of pulpwood, we actively promote conservation and forest management among suppliers and woodland owners.
 The Spring Grove facility includes four uncoated paper machines as well as an off-line blade coater and a specialty coater. Annual production capacity for coated paper is approximately 65,000 tons. The Chillicothe facility operates three paper machines producing uncoated and carbonless paper. Two of the machines have built-in coating capability which along with three additional coaters across the Ohio operations’ facilities provide annual coated capacity of approximately 126,000 tons.
 In addition to critical raw materials, the cost to produce Specialty Papers’ products is influenced by energy. In 2017, the business unit generated all of its steam needed for production and generated more power than it consumes at the Spring Grove, PA facility, and it purchased 

  approximately 35% of its electricity needed for the Chillicothe, OH mill. The primary fuel source for both facilities is natural gas following the conversion of their boilers from coal. 
 In Specialty Papers’ markets, competition is product line specific due to the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing for certain products. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carbonless paper and forms | Appvion, Inc., and to a lesser extent, Georgia Pacific, Fibria Celulose, Koehler Paper, Mitsubishi Paper, Nekoosa Coated Products, Packaging Corp and Asia Pulp and Paper Co.
Engineered products | Specialty papers divisions of International Paper, Domtar Corp., Packaging Corp, and Sappi Limited, among others. 
Envelope & converting | Domtar, International Paper, Georgia Pacific and Packaging Corp 
Book publishing | Domtar Corp., North Pacific Paper (NORPAC), Resolute Forest and others 

 
Customer service, product performance, technological advances and product pricing are important competitive factors with respect to all our products. We believe our reputation in these areas continues to be excellent.
 To be successful in the market environment in which Specialty Papers operates, our strategy is focused on:
 
• | new product and new business development capabilities to ensure optimal utilization of our capacity and to maximize margins;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging our flexible operating platform to optimize product mix by shifting production among the machines in our system to more closely match output with changing demand trends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | driving operational excellence by utilizing ongoing continuous improvement methodologies to ensure efficiencies and asset reliability; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining superior customer service.
