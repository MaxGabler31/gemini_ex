Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 McDermott International, Inc. (“McDermott”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Panama in 1959, is a fully integrated provider of engineering, procurement, construction and installation (“EPCI”) and technology solutions to the energy industry. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbol MDR. 
 On May 10, 2018, we completed our combination with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (“CB&I”) through a series of transactions (the “Combination”) (see below (Business Combination with CB&I) and Note 3, Business Combination, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). We design and build end-to-end infrastructure and technology solutions to transport and transform oil and gas into a variety of products. Our proprietary technologies, integrated expertise and comprehensive solutions are utilized for offshore, subsea, power, liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and downstream energy projects around the world. Our customers include national, major integrated and other oil and gas companies as well as producers of petrochemicals and electric power, and we operate in most major energy producing regions throughout the world.
 Our business is organized into five operating groups, which represent our reportable segments, consisting of: North, Central and South America (“NCSA”); Europe, Africa, Russia and Caspian (“EARC”); the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”); Asia Pacific (“APAC”); and Technology. For further discussion, see “Business Segments” below and Note 24, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, “McDermott,” “we,” “our” or “us” mean McDermott and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to any of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II. 
 Business Combination with CB&I
 On May 10, 2018 (the “Combination Date”) we completed the Combination. On the Combination Date, we acquired the equity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. CB&I subsidiaries that owned CB&I’s technology business, as well as certain intellectual property rights, for $2.87 billion in cash consideration that was funded using debt financing and existing cash. Also on the Combination Date, CB&I shareholders received 0.82407 shares of McDermott common stock for each share of CB&I common stock tendered in an exchange offer. Each remaining share of CB&I common stock held by CB&I shareholders not acquired by McDermott in the exchange offer was effectively converted into the right to receive the same 0.82407 shares of McDermott common stock that was paid in the exchange offer, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares of McDermott common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes. Stock-settled equity based awards relating to shares of CB&I’s common stock were either canceled and converted into the right to receive cash or were converted into comparable McDermott awards on generally the same terms and conditions as prior to the Combination Date. We issued 84.5 million shares of McDermott common stock to the former CB&I shareholders and converted CB&I stock-settled equity awards into McDermott stock-settled equity-based awards to be settled in approximately 2.2 million shares of McDermott common stock. See Note 3, Business Combination, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 Strategic Review of Business Portfolio 
 We have performed a strategic review of our business portfolio, which included businesses acquired in the Combination. Our review sought to determine if any portions of our business are non-core for purposes of our vertically integrated offering model. As a result of our review, we identified our storage tank and U.S. pipe fabrication businesses as non-core for purposes of our vertically integrated offering model. As a result and in view of the considerations discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we are developing plans to sell each of the two businesses, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We expect a substantial portion of the proceeds resulting from the sales of these businesses would be utilized to reduce our outstanding debt. 
 1


Business Segments
Following completion of the Combination, during the second quarter of 2018, we reorganized our operations into five business segments. This reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients, leverage our workforce, help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities. Our five business segments, which represent our reportable segments are: NCSA; EARC; MENA; APAC; and Technology. We also report certain corporate and other non-operating activities under the heading of “Corporate and Other,” which primarily reflects costs that are not allocated to our segments. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and Note 24, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our business segments. 
 Through our five business segments, we deliver a broad services offering that addresses four key end markets, as follows: 
 Offshore and subsea—We offer a comprehensive range of technology and EPCI services for the upstream oil & gas sector, including any combination of front-end design, engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, installation, hook-up, start-up and commissioning services across all phases of the project life cycle. We have a particular focus on installation of offshore oil & gas production systems, including jackets, topsides and floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels and pipelines, as well as installation of subsea production systems.  
 LNG—We offer a full range of technology and engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction services for the LNG industry, with a focus on natural gas liquefaction plants and LNG regasification terminals. We provide a full range of services, including conceptual design, detailed engineering, material procurement, pipe and storage tank fabrication, construction, project management, compliance support, commissioning and startup, and operator training. 
 Downstream—We design, build, and offer technology licenses and services for state-of-the-art petrochemical and refinery process units and plants. Our comprehensive services include market-leading proprietary technologies, process design, front-end engineering and design, detailed engineering, material procurement, pipe and storage tank fabrication, construction, permitting assistance, operator training, commissioning and startup. We offer solutions for clean fuels production, including low sulfur gasoline and diesel, as well as a wide range of refinery process units and related ancillary facilities.
 Power—We design and build new combined-cycle and simple-cycle gas-fired power generation projects and provide related engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services. Additionally, we are a joint venture partner of NET Power, LLC, a company that is developing a new natural gas power generation technology that produces low-cost electricity while reducing air emissions.
Contracts
 Our contracts are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis. We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, principally fixed-price, but also including cost reimbursable, cost-plus, day-rate and unit-rate basis or some combination of those methods. Factors that customers may consider include price, facility or equipment availability, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, efficiency, safety record and reputation.
 Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed amount to cover costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts can involve more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work. See “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with contractual pricing in our industry, including the risk that, if our actual costs exceed the costs we estimate on our fixed-price contracts, our profitability will decline and we may suffer losses” in Item 1A.
 We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such charges, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices. 
 We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accordingly, for each contract, we regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage of completion of the related project in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project, we recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material. 
 2


Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts. While these letters of credit, bonds and guarantees may involve significant dollar amounts, historically there have been no material payments to our customers under these arrangements. 
 Some of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if we are responsible for the failure to meet specified contractual milestone dates and the applicable customer asserts a claim under those provisions. Those contracts define the conditions under which our customers may make claims against us for liquidated damages. In many cases in which we have historically had potential exposure for liquidated damages, such damages ultimately were not asserted by our customers.  See Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business, can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Therefore, change order awards (although frequently beneficial in the long term) can have the short-term effect of reducing the job percentage of completion and thus the revenues and profits recognized to date. We regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit, proportionate to the job percentage of completion in the period when those estimates are revised. Revenue from unapproved change orders is recognized to the extent of amounts management expects to recover or costs incurred. Unapproved change orders that are disputed by the customer are treated as claims. 
 In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Some of our contracts, regardless of type, may operate under joint venture, consortium or other collaborative arrangements. Typically, we enter into these arrangements with reputable companies with whom we have worked previously. These arrangements are generally made to strengthen our market position or technical skills, or where the size, scale or location of the project warrants the use of such arrangements.
 Remaining Performance Obligations (“RPOs”)
 RPOs represent the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on projects. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook—Remaining Performance Obligations” for discussion and quantification of our RPO’s. See also “Risk Factors—Our RPOs are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations” in Item 1A.
 Competition
 We operate in a competitive environment. Technology performance, price, timeliness of completion, quality, safety record, track record and reputation are principal competitive factors within our industry. There are numerous regional, national and global competitors that offer similar services to those offered by each of our operating groups, including Axens SA; Bechtel Group Inc.; China Offshore Oil Engineering Co. Ltd.; Fluor Corporation; Honeywell/UOP; Hyundai Heavy Industrial Co. Ltd.; KBR Inc.; Kiewit Corporation; Larsen and Toubro Ltd.; Lyondell Basell Industries N.V.; Petrofac International Ltd.; Saipem S.P.A.; Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.; Subsea 7 S.A.; Techidas Reunidas, S.A; TechnipFMC plc; Wood plc; Worley Parson Limited and W.R. Grace & Co. 
Significant Customers 
 See Note 24, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information on customers that accounted for significant percentages of our consolidated revenues.
 Raw Materials and Suppliers
 The principal raw materials we use are metal plate, structural steel, pipe, fittings, catalysts, proprietary equipment and selected engineered equipment such as pressure vessels, exchangers, pumps, valves, compressors, motors and electrical and instrumentation components. Most of these materials are available from numerous suppliers worldwide, with some furnished under negotiated supply agreements. We anticipate being able to obtain these materials for the foreseeable future; however, the price, availability and scheduled deliveries offered by our suppliers may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors, including supplier consolidations, supplier raw material shortages, costs, surcharges, supplier capacity, customer demand, market conditions and any duties and tariffs imposed on the materials.
 3


We use subcontractors where it assists us in meeting customer requirements with regard to resources, schedule, cost or technical expertise. These subcontractors may range from small local entities to companies with global capabilities, some of which may be utilized on a repetitive or preferred basis. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 31,900 persons worldwide, comprised of approximately 14,600 salaried employees and approximately 17,300 hourly and craft employees. Our number of employees, particularly hourly and craft, varies in relation to the location, number and size of projects we have in process at any given time. To preserve our project management and technological expertise as core competencies, we continuously recruit and develop qualified personnel, and maintain ongoing training programs for all our key personnel. 
 The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2018 was approximately 5% to 10%. We have agreements, which we customarily renew periodically, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites and fabrication facilities in the U.S. and Canada and various other countries. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.
 Patents and Licenses 
 We have numerous active patents and patent applications throughout the world, the majority of which are associated with technologies licensed by our Technology operating group. We continue to invest in research and development to ensure that our portfolio of patents remains competitive and we also acquire rights to technologies when we consider it advantageous for us to do so. However, no individual patent is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business. 
Hazard Risks and Loss Control Systems
 Our operations present risks of injury to or death of people, loss of or damage to property and damage to the environment. We conduct difficult and frequently precise operations in very challenging and dynamic locations. We have created loss control systems to assist us in the identification and treatment of the hazard risks presented by our operations, and we endeavor to make sure these systems are effective. 
 As loss control measures will not always be successful, we seek to establish various means of funding losses and liability related to incidents or occurrences. We primarily seek to do this through contractual protections, including waivers of consequential damages, indemnities, caps on liability, liquidated damage provisions and access to the insurance of other parties. We also procure insurance for certain potential losses or liabilities, operate our own “captive” insurance company or establish funded or unfunded reserves. In cases where we place insurance, we are subject to the credit worthiness of the relevant insurer(s), the available limits of the coverage, our retention under the relevant policy, exclusions in the policy and gaps in coverage. There can be no assurance that our insurance arrangements will adequately address all risks. See “Item 1A, Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Operations—Our operations are subject to operating risks and limits on insurance coverage and contractual indemnity protections, which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities and costs.” 
 Our wholly owned “captive” insurance subsidiary provides coverage for our retentions under employer’s liability, general and products liability, automotive liability and workers’ compensation insurance and, from time to time, builder’s risk and marine hull insurance within certain limits. We may also have business reasons in the future to arrange for our insurance subsidiary to insure other risks which we cannot or do not wish to transfer to outside insurance companies. Premiums charged and reserves related to these insurance programs are based on the facts and circumstances specific to historic losses, loss factors and the performance of the outside insurance market for the type of risk at issue. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover losses in our captive insurance programs. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted as required based upon reported claims, actual claim payments and settlements and claim reserves. Claims as a result of our operations, if greater in frequency or severity than actuarially predicted, could adversely impact the ability of our captive insurance subsidiary to respond to all claims presented.

Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 General 
 Many aspects of our operations and properties are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to: 

• | constructing and equipping offshore production platforms and various onshore and offshore facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | workplace health and safety, including marine vessel safety;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the operation of foreign-flagged vessels in the coastal trade;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | data privacy;
--+--------------


• | currency conversions and repatriation;
--+---------------------------------------


• | taxation of unremitted earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protecting the environment.
--+----------------------------

 In addition, we depend on the demand for certain of our services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, are affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for environmental, economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services. 
 We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. 
 The exploration and development of oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the United States is regulated primarily under the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and related regulations. These laws require the construction, operation and removal of offshore production facilities located on the outer continental shelf of the United States to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. Similar regulations govern the plugging and abandoning of wells located on the outer continental shelf of the United States and the removal of all production facilities. Violations of regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctions curtailing operations. 
 We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations. 
 Environmental 
 Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. 
 These laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to these federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges and hazardous substances and waste management and disposal, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, including, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.

In addition, offshore construction and drilling in some areas have been opposed by environmental groups and, in some areas, have been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. 
 We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under the CERCLA. CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. 
 In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, including those associated with acquired operations, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of waste to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year. 
 We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations and maintain insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We do not anticipate we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or for the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during 2019 or 2020. As of December 31, 2018, we had no environmental reserve recorded. See Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
 We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the “safe harbor” protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.

 We believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause estimates in our financial statements to differ materially from actual results and those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this report, including those mentioned under the caption “Risk Factors.” These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises, except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that factors not referred to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
