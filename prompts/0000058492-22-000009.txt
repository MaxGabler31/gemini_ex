 Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated ("Leggett & Platt," "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs, and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes and automobiles. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 15 business units, which are divided into seven groups under our three segments: Bedding Products; Specialized Products; and Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products.
 Overview of Our Segments

Bedding Products Segment

BEDDING GROUP 
Steel Rod 
Drawn Wire 
U.S. Spring 
Specialty Foam 
Adjustable Bed 
International Spring
Machinery 


Our Bedding Products segment has its roots in the Company's founding in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coil bedsprings. Today, we support our customers' needs from raw materials to components to finished mattresses and foundations to distribution and fulfillment. Our innerspring, specialty foam, and finished product development and production capabilities allow us to create value at each point, from raw materials all the way to private label finished goods and delivery to the consumer. 
We operate a steel rod mill in the U.S. with historical annual output of about 500,000 tons. A substantial majority of that output has been used by our two U.S. wire mills that have supplied virtually all of the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. We also supply steel rod and wire to trade customers that operate in a broad range of markets.
We are a major supplier of adjustable beds, with domestic manufacturing and distribution, and global sourcing capabilities. We also produce machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component and finished product needs.
These innovative proprietary products and our efficient and low-cost vertical integration have made us the largest U.S.-based manufacturer in many of these businesses. We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting end-consumer needs. We believe we attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, large-scale production, and purchasing leverage. Sourcing components and finished products from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising, and marketing their products.

Strategic Priorities

Primary Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is a primary financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. We target average annual TSR of 11–14% through an approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
Our incentive programs reward return and cash generation, and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 300 peers). For information about our TSR targets, see the discussion under Total Shareholder Return in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 32. 
Disciplined Growth

The expected long-term contribution to TSR from revenue growth is 6-9%. From 2019 to 2021, we generated combined unit volume and acquisition growth of 2% per year on average. We also benefited from commodity inflation, resulting in total revenue growth of 6% per year on average. We expect to achieve the growth target through a combination of sources, including: (i) increasing content and new programs, particularly in our Bedding Products and Specialized Products segments; (ii) expanding our addressable markets; and (iii) identifying strategic acquisitions that complement our current products or capabilities. 
We will continue to make investments to support expansion in current businesses and product lines where sales are growing profitably. We also envision periodic acquisitions that add capabilities in these businesses or provide opportunities 
PART I

to enter more diverse, faster-growing, and higher margin markets. We expect all acquisitions to have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in attractive and growing markets.
Returning Cash to Shareholders

From 2019 to 2021, we generated $1.54 billion of operating cash, and we returned some of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends ($634 million) and share repurchases ($37 million). Our long-term priorities for use of cash are: fund organic growth including capital expenditures, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock with available cash. Recently, because of the debt level increases in connection with the Elite Comfort Solutions (ECS) acquisition in early 2019, we have focused on deleveraging by temporarily limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisition spending, and using operating cash flow to repay debt.
For information about dividends and share repurchases, see the discussion under Dividends on page 47 and Stock Repurchases on page 47 in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Macro Market Challenges
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020 materially reducing the demand for our products. We responded to the pandemic by, among other things, aligning our variable cost structure to reduced demand levels, significantly reducing fixed costs, and cutting capital expenditures. We ended 2020 with fixed cost savings of approximately $90 million. By mid-second quarter of 2020, we began to see rapid recovery in businesses serving home-related and auto markets which benefited our Bedding, Home Furniture, Flooring and Textile, and Automotive businesses. 
As demand recovered in Bedding, we began to face global constraints, including shortages of nonwoven fabrics used in the production of ComfortCore® innersprings and availability of labor. Labor issues were amplified by the rapid change in our production needs. Our operations shifted from a near shutdown in early April 2020 to customer demand in excess of pre-pandemic levels in a matter of weeks across many of our businesses. Chemical shortages also emerged as producers of the chemicals used to make foam were impacted by various weather issues and reported a variety of equipment and production issues.
In 2021, despite continued macro market challenges, including supply chain issues related to semiconductor shortages, foam chemical shortages, labor availability, and transportation challenges, as well as higher costs associated with each of these issues, we recorded record sales and earnings from continuing operations. We made progress on the chemical and labor shortages; however, both of these issues continued throughout 2021. Semiconductor shortages are expected to continue through at least 2023. 
For more information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to COVID-19 Impacts on our Business in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 33.

Dependence on Market Demand for Key Product Families

Our business is dependent upon the market demand for, and continued sale of, various product families. The following table shows our approximate percentage of trade sales by product family for the last three years which indicates the degree of dependence upon market demand: 

Product Families | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Bedding Group | 48 | % | | 48 | % | 48 | %
Flooring & Textile Products Group | | | | | | 16 | 
Automotive Group | | | | | | 17 | 
Home Furniture Group | 8 | | | | | | 
Work Furniture Group | 6 | | | | | | 
Aerospace Products Group | 2 | | | | | | 
Hydraulic Cylinders Group | 2 | | | 2 | | 2 | 

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government. As such, our business is not materially dependent upon governmental customers. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use, except for semiconductors and certain chemicals as explained below. Among the most important raw materials that we use are:

• | Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, sheet, and stainless
• | Chemicals used in foam production 
• | Foam scrap 
• | Woven and nonwoven fabrics 
• | Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals 
• | Electronic systems (including semiconductors) 

Currently there is a shortage of semiconductors in the automotive industry. Automotive OEMs and other suppliers have not been able to secure an adequate supply of semiconductors, and as a result have reduced or completely shut down their production of some automobiles or parts, which in turn has reduced our sale of products. Consumer demand remains strong, but the semiconductor shortage has pushed vehicle inventories to very low levels. Our Automotive Group uses the semiconductors in seat comfort products, and to a lesser extent in motors and actuators. To date, our Automotive Group has been able to obtain an adequate supply of semiconductors. We are dependent on our suppliers to deliver these semiconductors in accordance with our production schedule, and a shortage of the semiconductors can disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver products to our customers. If we cannot secure an adequate supply of semiconductors in our supply chain, or the automotive OEMs and other suppliers continue to reduce their production as a result of such shortage, this may negatively impact our sales, earnings, and financial condition.
We have exposure to the cost of chemicals, including TDI, MDI, and polyol. The cost of these chemicals has fluctuated at times, but we have generally passed the changes through to our customers. Chemical prices deflated in the first half of 2020. Inflation began in the second half of the year and continued throughout 2021 as a result of several factors, including robust demand, shortages from severe weather, supplier production disruptions, port delays, and logistics challenges. The supply shortages resulted in significant restrictions by producers, however, supply availability improved in late fourth quarter 2021. If we are unable to obtain the chemicals or pass the cost along to our customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.
PART I

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses. We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2021, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 33% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole, and on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including each of our segments.
Patents and Trademarks
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,207 patents issued, 501 patents in process, 1,081 trademarks registered and 78 trademarks in process. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations as a whole. A significant number of our patents relate to products manufactured in each of our three segments, while over half of our trademarks relate to products manufactured by the Bedding Products segment. We do not have any patent or group of patents, the expiration of which would have a material negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
Some of our most significant trademarks include: 
• | ComfortCore®, Mira-Coil®, VertiCoil®, Quantum®, Nanocoil®, Softech®, Lura-Flex®, Superlastic®, and Active Support Technology® (mattress innersprings) 
• | Energex®,Coolflow®, ThermaGel®, and EcoFlowTM (specialty foam products) 
• | Semi-Flex® (box spring components and foundations) 
• | Spuhl®and Fides® (mattress innerspring manufacturing machines) 
• | Wall Hugger® (recliner chair mechanisms) 
• | No-Sag® (wire forms used in seating) 
• | LPSense® (capacitive sensing) 
• | Hanes® (fabric materials) 
• | Schukra® (automotive seating products) 
• | Gribetz®and Porter® (quilting and sewing machines) 

Product Development
One of our strongest performing product categories across the Company is ComfortCore®, our fabric-encased innerspring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses. ComfortCore® represented over 60% of our U.S. innerspring units in 2021. A number of our ComfortCore® innersprings contain a feature we call Quantum® Edge. These are narrow-diameter, fabric-encased coils that form a perimeter around an innerspring set, replacing a rigid foam perimeter in a finished mattress. In 2021, approximately 50% of our ComfortCore® innersprings in the U.S. had the Quantum® Edge feature.  
Our Specialty Foam business formulates many of the chemicals and additives used in the production of specialty foams for the bedding and furniture industries. These branded, specialty polyols and additives enhance foam performance by reducing heat retention, improving durability, and diminishing odor. These innovations enable us to create quality mattresses that can be compressed, and we have a significant amount of intellectual property around these specialty chemical formulations.
PART I

Our Automotive business designs and engineers lightweight structures that help reduce overall vehicle weight, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce noise while maintaining performance, safety, and functionality. These products help auto manufacturers meet emission standards and their environmental goals.
Many of our other businesses are engaged in product development activities to protect our market position, support ongoing growth, and help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
Human Capital Management
Our long-term success depends on our ability to attract and retain diverse talent, develop that talent, and plan for future succession. The first step toward building our future is to enable a culture of employee development and engagement at all levels of the Company by ensuring our employees have the tools and resources they need to succeed. Our employees are encouraged to actively develop their skills and take ownership in our success. We also recognize the importance of keeping our employees safe. In the following sections, we discuss our efforts to achieve these objectives. 
Board Oversight

The Board’s Human Resources and Compensation Committee has oversight of the Company’s human capital management, including oversight of (i) our human resources policies and programs; (ii) CEO, executive officer, and director compensation; (iii) our equity and incentive compensation plans; (iv) executive succession planning; and (v) senior management leadership development. Such oversight is designed to (i) support our business objectives; (ii) attract, retain, and develop high quality leadership; and (iii) link compensation with business objectives and performance. 
Our Employees

Our Employees. At year-end 2021, we had approximately 20,300 employees, of which 14,800 were engaged in production and 11,300 were international employees (including 5,500 in Asia and 3,200 in Europe). Of these employees, 7,100 were in Bedding Products, 7,400 were in Specialized Products, and 5,000 were in Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products, with the remainder at our corporate office or in other roles. At year-end 2020, we had approximately 20,400 employees.
Collective Bargaining. At year-end 2021, 16% of our employees were represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages, or other issues. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to labor contract negotiations during 2021. Management is not aware of circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2022.
Our Ability to Attract, Recruit, and Retain Employees

We operate in competitive labor markets, and accordingly, we strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs, learning and development opportunities that support career growth and advancement opportunities, and employee engagement initiatives that foster a strong Company culture. 
Competitive Compensation and Benefits. In addition to cash compensation, we offer customary benefits in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Many of our locations offer health and welfare benefits to eligible employees and their dependents which may include, but are not limited to, health insurance, dental and vision plans, flexible spending plans, retirement savings with matching contributions, and income protection benefits, such as short and long-term disability insurance, life insurance, and paid leave benefits that include vacation, personal time, and holidays. In the U.S., we offer a well-being program which includes counseling, legal and financial consultation, work-life assistance, and crisis intervention services. Additionally, in the U.S. and Canada, our employees are eligible to participate in discount stock purchase plans. We also provide cash and equity incentive programs for key management employees based on our performance. Finally, we support the work-life balance of our employees, including part-time jobs, flexible hours, paid leave benefits, and remote and hybrid working, where applicable.
Employee Engagement and Satisfaction. At many of our locations, we analyze employee satisfaction and attempt to enhance engagement and mitigate related risks. Important data on employee satisfaction, feedback, and turnover are 
PART I

analyzed to identify improvement opportunities. The results of surveys and data analyses are used to assess human capital risks and identify opportunities for more meaningful employee engagement. From this analysis, action plans are developed, and branch-level initiatives are adopted to improve engagement and reduce turnover. We also engage with our employees through our Ethics Hotline, which serves as a grievance-reporting mechanism. Employees can express concerns, confidentially and anonymously, regarding possible violations of ethics, law, or our policies. 
A core element of our human capital strategy is our ability to attract, inform, and engage talented job seekers. To offer potential employees relevant insight into the culture of the Company, we maintain a comprehensive social media strategy. Via the Life@Leggett blog, we regularly publish content showcasing Company history, product advancements, cultural events, and community engagement.
Turnover. We rely on a diverse workforce to sustain our strategies and deliver our results of operations. In order to achieve our goals, this workforce must be stable. In 2021, our turnover rates in the U.S. were reasonably comparable to average voluntary turnover rates of manufacturers in the industries in which we operate. 
Our Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity
We continue to foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&E) in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute, thrive, and advance. Our commitment is unwavering, and we are steadfast in maintaining our focus on building a workforce that represents the many customers we serve and the communities in which we operate around the world. In furtherance of this commitment, we expect to continue building our foundational awareness, understanding, engagement, and skills.
Fostering an Inclusive and Diverse Culture. We believe diverse teams generate better ideas and make better decisions, and that companies who lead in inclusion and diversity also lead financially. We have created strategies and action plans designed to foster an inclusive and diverse culture that aligns with our values and priorities. 
Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Plan. We have an inclusion and diversity team comprised of a broad group of employees including senior management. The team has established long-term strategies and action plans designed to: (i) ensure that we have a safe and inclusive workplace; (ii) equip our people to attract, develop, retain, and reward a diverse and inclusive workforce; (iii) be an inclusive and equitable corporate citizen; (iv) develop a governance and accountability model that will sustain inclusion and diversity; and (v) enhance our business results. To date, our team has:
•hired an ID&E Director to guide our priorities, plans, and actions;
•established a calendar of multicultural events and shared stories that celebrate our diversity;
•conducted an employee engagement survey that gathered feedback on employee experiences with ID&E in the workplace. This feedback is expected to drive our priorities across the Company and within our local plants. The survey included questions about various aspects of ID&E: dignity and respect, belonging and inclusion, diversity, trust, voice, equity and fairness, and psychological safety; and 
•gathered representation data on our salaried and hourly workforce across gender, race/ethnicity, and age characteristics. 
Our future action plans include a variety of activities designed to further our ID&E objectives. These activities may include: (i) sharing our ID&E insights, results, and next steps with employees; (ii) enhancing our inclusive leadership skills; (iii) identifying and communicating our ID&E goals; (iv) celebrating diversity awareness and understanding; (v) finalizing our philanthropy strategy to advocate support for underrepresented communities; (vi) enhancing our supplier diversity strategy; (vii) partnering with colleges, universities, associations, and historically black colleges and universities to attract our next generation of talent; and (viii) incorporating our learnings into global and local changes in human resource, talent, performance, promotion, and recruiting policies and practices. 
At year-end 2021, in the U.S., 28% of our employees identified as female and 38% identified with a historically marginalized group. We believe that it is important to increase representation of women in management and leadership roles in the Company and expect this to be a key commitment for us in 2022 and beyond. While the Company’s racial diversity is comparable to the 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics, we also see opportunities to increase our race and ethnic representation in leadership roles. Finally, as discussed above, in 2021, we gathered gender, race/ethnicity, and age data to serve as a baseline for future goals, metrics, and actions. 
PART I

Equal Opportunity. We are committed to equal opportunity and base workplace decisions solely on merit, qualifications, and other job-related, neutral, non-discriminatory criteria. We provide equal employment opportunity without regard to age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy, religion, disability, military status, genetic information, or other status protected by law. We are committed to providing a harassment-free work environment, and we prohibit retaliation, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination against individuals who, in good faith, complain of unlawful discrimination or harassment. 
Our Workforce Health and Safety
Workforce Health. We are focused on protecting our employees and ensuring a healthy work environment. To respond to COVID-19, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team. Our business leaders manage items such as developing health and safety protocols, responding to health and safety issues, interpreting government orders, and securing personal protective equipment. We developed a comprehensive handbook to set and communicate work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate COVID-19 health and safety measures, including proper social distancing. Our business leaders have implemented training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. When employees test positive for COVID-19, we follow adopted procedures including enhanced disinfecting that targets applicable areas. The affected employee is required to observe an isolation period, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work. Contact tracing is performed to identify employees who had direct contact with the affected employee. If direct contacts are identified, those employees must quarantine, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work.
Workplace Safety. We are dedicated to the safety of our employees through prevention, education, and awareness with the objective of reducing, or even eliminating, workplace injuries through accident investigation and process safety. Our dedicated staff of professionals supports safety management at our manufacturing facilities, including implementation of a comprehensive program called “SafeGuard.” The SafeGuard program develops relevant job hazard analyses, which are undertaken on many processes and used to develop comprehensive job procedures. This allows us to implement job-specific health and safety practices across our business. 
Continuing Education and Training
Developing Our Talent. Although some of our established learning and development programs, as disclosed below, have changed in delivery method due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, developing our talent continues to be part of our ongoing, long-term strategy, which is focused on growing talent, including technical/skilled positions, supervisory and management levels, and future leaders. We believe that people are our greatest asset, and the first step toward building our future and achieving or surpassing our long-term strategic business goals is to enable a culture of employee development at all levels of the Company. This means ensuring that our employees have the tools and resources necessary to execute those business strategies. 
Frontline Supervisor Training Program. The global Frontline Supervisor Training Program is designed to help managers and leaders at manufacturing and distribution locations develop the leadership skills necessary to enhance strong employee engagement. The program stresses communication, leadership, conflict resolution, respect in the workplace, and safety. In 2021, our program successfully trained almost 400 of our global team leaders.
Intern Program. We also have an intern program that is focused on the next generation of Company leaders. In 2021, leadership and developmental workshops for interns included goal setting, personal branding, networking in the workplace, communication and leadership, positive conflict, dealing with criticism, and giving and receiving feedback. Internships are a critical element in our talent pipeline in terms of our ability to recruit professionals early in their careers who will understand what we do in all our manufacturing diversity. Over the last 5 years, the Company has hosted approximately 100 interns in our Doors Internship Program. 
Health and Safety Training. Our manufacturing employees receive new hire safety training, annual refresher safety training, weekly “tool box” talks regarding safety and training, and job-specific safety training based on the jobs hazards analysis developed from our SafeGuard program.
PART I

Succession Development
Management and Leadership Positions. Our commitment to having strong managers and leadership in critical roles across the company continues to serve us well. Our values and culture guide our talent initiatives which are designed to create a pipeline of strong, high performing leadership candidates to serve in progressively important roles throughout the Company. Our internal promotion rate over the last three years for corporate officer positions was 77%. We are building on our success in these areas and continue to push our succession development processes to new levels to allow us to adapt and grow.
As a result of our intentional succession planning and development processes, which included many years of close collaboration, as of January 1, 2022, J. Mitchell Dolloff transitioned to Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Dolloff succeeded Karl G. Glassman, who had served as Chief Executive Officer since 2016. In addition, in August 2021, J. Tyson Hagale was promoted to Senior Vice President and President of the Bedding Products segment after serving the Company for more than 20 years in various roles of increasing responsibility.
Trends in Market Demand and Competition

Demand Trends for our Products. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn had a negative effect on the demand for our products and our customers’ products. By mid-second quarter 2020, we began to see rapid recovery in businesses serving home-related and auto markets. This benefited our Bedding, Home Furniture, Flooring and Textile, and Automotive businesses. We ended 2020 with fourth quarter sales in many of our businesses above fourth quarter 2019 levels. In 2021, our trade sales grew 7% compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. 
Competition. Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product family, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing, and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
 Based on certain industry data, we believe we are the largest U.S.-based manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

• | Bedding components 
• | Automotive seat support and lumbar systems 
• | Specialty bedding foams and private label finished mattresses
• | Components for home furniture and work furniture 
• | Flooring underlayment 
• | Adjustable beds 
• | Bedding industry machinery 

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors, as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically compete in market segments that value product differentiation. However, when we do compete on cost, we typically remain price competitive in most of our business units, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, automation, vertical integration in steel rod and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large-scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. We have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs, and shifting production offshore to take advantage of lower input costs.

For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring, steel wire rod, and mattress imports, please see Competition in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 36.
PART I

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year such as inflation and deflation, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, our operating cash flows are stronger in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors. 
Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies or unexpected operational or other developments, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures (including those capital expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings, and competitive position. 
Internet Access to Information

We routinely post information for investors under the Investor Relations section of our website (www.leggett.com). Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Human Resources and Compensation, and Nominating, Governance and Sustainability Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Governance section. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry and Market Data

Unless indicated otherwise, the information concerning our industries contained in this Annual Report is based on our general knowledge of and expectations concerning the industries. Our market share is based on estimates using our internal data, data from various industry analyses, internal research, and adjustments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. We have not independently verified data from industry analyses and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness.
 Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
PART I

OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact to (i) our manufacturing operations' ability to remain fully operational; and (ii) our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and parts, maintain appropriate labor levels, and ship finished products to customers due to supply chain disruptions or otherwise; all of which, in the aggregate, have had, and could further have, a negative impact on our trade sales, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition, and our stock price.
As of December 31, 2021, we had manufacturing facilities in 18 countries. All of these countries have been, and are continuing to be, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our facilities are open and running at this time. From time to time, we have some capacity restrictions on our plants due to governmental orders in various parts of the world. We have been and could be further negatively affected by governmental action in any one or more of the countries in which we operate by the imposition, or re-imposition, of restrictive social measures, mandatory closures of retail establishments that sell our products or our customers’ products, travel restrictions, and restrictions on the import or export of products. 
Depending on the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of the population vaccinated, and the effectiveness of the vaccines against new variants, our ability to keep our manufacturing operations fully operational, build and maintain appropriate labor levels, obtain necessary raw materials and parts, and ship finished products to customers, due to supply chain disruptions or otherwise, may be partially or completely disrupted, either on a temporary or prolonged basis. The continued realization of these risks to our manufacturing operations, labor force, and supply chain could also increase labor, commodity, and energy costs. 
Some facilities have experienced supply chain problems delivering products to customers and disruptions in logistics necessary to import, export, or transfer products, which have generally resulted in increased freight costs that are typically passed through to our customers. Our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports. More specifically, we have experienced supply chain disruptions related to semiconductor shortages, foam chemical shortages, labor availability, and freight challenges, as well as higher costs associated with each of these issues. This has resulted in reduced volume and higher costs in most of our businesses, including our Automotive business and Bedding Products segment, primarily related to negative impacts on component demand and finished goods production. If we are unable to obtain necessary raw materials or experience disruptions in delivering products to our customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. 
When our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 or may have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, we follow adopted protocols which may include enhanced disinfecting in targeted areas, contact tracing, testing, mask wearing, and mandating certain isolation and quarantine periods. A significant increase in COVID-19 cases among our employees may disrupt our ability to maintain necessary labor levels and produce and deliver products to our customers if we are unable to shift production to other manufacturing facilities. 
Certain governmental authorities, including state or foreign jurisdictions, may adopt laws mandating COVID-19 vaccination or periodic testing with masking requirements for unvaccinated employees. Because some of our employees may be hesitant to take a vaccine or be tested, the requirements, if adopted, may cause some employees to terminate employment with us which may challenge our ability to maintain appropriate labor levels in our facilities and keep our manufacturing locations fully operational. If these requirements are adopted, they may also create disruptions to our suppliers and customers.
Business disruptions to our steel rod mill, if coupled with an inability to purchase an adequate and/or timely supply of quality steel rod from alternative sources, could have a material negative impact on our Bedding Products segment and the Company's results of operations.
We purchase steel scrap from third party suppliers. This scrap is converted into steel rod in our mill in Sterling, Illinois. Our steel rod mill has historically had annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, a substantial majority of which has been used internally by our wire mills, which convert the steel rod into drawn steel wire. This wire is used in the production of many of our products, including mattress innersprings. 
A disruption to the operation of, or supply of steel scrap to, our steel rod mill could require us to purchase steel rod from alternative supply sources, subject to market availability. Ongoing trade action by the United States government, along with the existence of antidumping and countervailing duty orders against multiple countries, could result in reduced market availability and/or higher cost of steel rod.
PART I

If we experience a disruption to our ability to produce steel rod in our mill, coupled with a reduction of adequate and/or timely supply from alternative market sources of quality steel rod, we could experience a material negative impact on our Bedding Products segment and the Company's results of operations.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact on the collection of trade and other notes receivable in accordance with their terms due to customer bankruptcy, financial difficulties, or insolvency.
Beginning in early 2020, many of our customers and other third parties were adversely affected by the social and governmental restrictions and limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, we believed the risk of customer nonpayment increased. As such, in the first quarter of 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $20 million, including $9 million associated with a single customer in our Bedding Products segment (fully reserving the balances for this customer). As 2020 progressed, worldwide conditions stabilized, and our bad debt expense finished at $17 million for the year. During 2021, as social and governmental restrictions and limitations were relaxed, trends in customer payment experience and macroeconomic conditions improved and accordingly, we believe the risk of customer nonpayment decreased. Because of these improvements, we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts by $3 million for 2021.
 If our customers continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 they may suffer significant financial difficulty. As a result, they may be unable to pay their debts to us, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these parties. If we are unable to collect trade receivables and other notes receivable on a timely basis, larger provisions for bad debt may be required and result in a negative impact on our earnings, liquidity, cash flow, and financial condition. 
Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings. 
A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $2.2 billion, or 41% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and sundry assets totaled $1.1 billion, or 20% of total assets.
We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in the second quarter as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
Our annual goodwill impairment testing performed in the second quarter of 2021 indicated no goodwill impairments. However, fair value exceeds carrying value by less than 100% for two reporting units as summarized in the table below:

 | Fair value in excess of carrying value | | Goodwill 
 | Goodwill impairment testing as performed in the second quarter 2021 | | Goodwill impairment testing as performed in the second quarter 2020 | | As of December 31, 2021
Aerospace | 28 | % | | 51 | % | $68 million 
Work Furniture | 85 | % | | 25 | % | $101 million

The decrease in fair value for Aerospace, as compared to 2020, is reflective of industry trends. Demand for fabricated duct assemblies in 2021 was near 2019 levels, but demand for welded and seamless tube products is still well below pre-pandemic levels. With the lingering impact from pandemic-related disruption in air travel and resulting buildup of aircraft and supply chain inventories, the industry is not anticipated to return to 2019 demand levels until 2024. While there is also a lag in recovery in the Work Furniture reporting unit, we continue to see steady demand for products sold for residential use, and the contract market continues to gradually improve as employees return to the office. We are continuing to 
PART I

monitor all factors impacting these industries. If the adverse economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is longer than expected, we may not be able to achieve projected performance levels. If actual results of any of our reporting units materially differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur future impairment charges. These non-cash charges could have a material negative impact on our earnings.

For more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, please refer to Note C on page 83 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 If we do not comply with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we may not be able to borrow in the commercial paper market or under our credit facility and our outstanding debt instruments may default, all of which could adversely impact our liquidity.
Our credit facility is a multi-currency facility maturing in September 2026, providing us the ability, from time to time, to borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to $1.2 billion, subject to certain restrictive covenants and customary conditions. The credit facility serves as back-up for our commercial paper borrowing. 
Our credit facility was amended effective September 30, 2021 and contains revised restrictive covenants. The amended covenants (a) require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness minus the lesser of: (A) Unrestricted Cash, or (B) $750 million to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive trailing quarters, such ratio not being greater than 3.50 to 1.00, provided, however, subject to certain limitations, if the Company has made a Material Acquisition in any fiscal quarter, at the Company’s election, the maximum Leverage Ratio shall be 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter during which such Material Acquisition is consummated and the next three consecutive fiscal quarters; (b) limit the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and (c) limit our ability to sell, lease, transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than accounts receivable sold in a Permitted Securitization Transaction, products sold in the ordinary course of business and our ability to sell, lease, transfer or dispose of any of the assets of the Company or one of its subsidiaries to the Company or one of its subsidiaries, as applicable) at any given point in time; each (a), (b), and (c) above as determined by the terms of the Credit Agreement, filed with the SEC on October 1, 2021 as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K. 
If our earnings are reduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, the covenants in the credit facility will reduce our borrowing capacity, both under the credit facility or through commercial paper issuances. Depending on the degree of earnings reduction, our liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. This covenant may also restrict our current and future operations, including (i) our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and industries; and (ii) our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. If we are not in compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we may not be able to access the commercial paper market or borrow under the credit facility. 
Also, if we fail to comply with the covenants specified in the credit facility, we may trigger an event of default, in which case the lenders would have the right to: (i) terminate their commitment to provide loans under the credit facility; and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, our senior notes contain cross-default provisions which could make outstanding amounts under the senior notes immediately payable in the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility following a material uncured default. If debt under the credit facility or senior notes were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.

Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, we had $121 million of deferred tax assets ($137 million less a $16 million valuation allowance). After netting of deferred tax liabilities, the net amount presented within Sundry assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is $9 million. It is possible the amount and source of our taxable income could materially change in the future. Particularly, our mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction may materially change in that we may have more or less taxable income generated in North America, Europe, or Asia as compared to prior years. This change may 
PART I

impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation allowances are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets. As a result, we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.
MARKET RISK FACTORS
Volatile raw material and labor costs and availability could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our profit margins and earnings.
Steel is our principal raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years. This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed, and this would negatively impact our results of operations.
We have exposure to the cost of chemicals, including TDI, MDI, and polyol. The cost of these chemicals has fluctuated at times, but we have generally passed the changes through to our customers. Chemical prices deflated in the first half of 2020. Inflation began in the second half of the year and continued throughout 2021 as a result of several factors, including robust demand, shortages from severe weather, supplier production disruptions, port delays, and logistics challenges. The supply shortages resulted in significant restrictions by producers, however, supply availability improved in late fourth quarter 2021. We import certain chemicals to supplement domestic supply, but port delays and logistics issues could limit access to those products. If we are unable to obtain the chemicals or pass the cost along to our customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. 
Currently there is a shortage of semiconductors in the automotive industry. Automotive OEMs and other suppliers have not been able to secure an adequate supply of semiconductors, and as a result have reduced or completely shut down their production of some automobiles or parts, which in turn has reduced our sale of products. Consumer demand remains strong, but the semiconductor shortage has pushed vehicle inventories to very low levels. Our Automotive Group uses the semiconductors in seat comfort products, and to a lesser extent in motors and actuators. To date, our Automotive Group has been able to obtain an adequate supply of semiconductors. We are dependent on our suppliers to deliver these semiconductors in accordance with our production schedule, and a shortage of the semiconductors can disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver products to our customers. If we cannot secure an adequate supply of semiconductors in our supply chain, or the automotive OEMs and other suppliers continue to reduce their production as a result of such shortage, this may negatively impact our sales, earnings, and financial condition.
Some facilities have experienced disruptions in logistics necessary to import or transfer raw materials, which has generally resulted in increased transportation costs that are typically passed through to our customers. Our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports and trucking constraints. This could impact the availability of certain raw materials and parts that we use in our manufacturing process.
Higher raw material costs could lead some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods and replacing higher-cost components with lower-cost components. If this were to occur, it could negatively impact our results of operations.
Because of shortages in the labor markets, several industries in which we operate have experienced challenges in hiring and maintaining adequate workforce levels, as well as increased labor costs. If this continues, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.
Unfair competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings. 
We produce innersprings for mattresses that are sold to bedding manufacturers. We produce steel wire rod for consumption by our wire mills (primarily to produce innersprings) and to sell to third parties. We also produce and sell finished mattresses.
PART I

Since 2009, there have been antidumping duties on the import of innersprings from China, South Africa, and Vietnam imposed by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and International Trade Commission (ITC) extending through 2024. The DOC and ITC have also imposed antidumping duties and countervailing duties on imports of steel wire rod from various countries, including China. These duties will expire, unless extended, at different times ranging from 2022 to 2025. Also, antidumping duties have been imposed by the DOC and ITC on the import of finished mattresses from various countries including China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, which will expire, unless extended, at different times ranging from 2024 to 2026. If the existing antidumping and countervailing duties are overturned on appeal or not extended beyond their current terms and dumping and/or subsidization recurs, or manufacturers in the subject countries circumvent the existing duties through transshipment in other jurisdictions or otherwise, our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings could be adversely affected.
Our borrowing costs and access to liquidity may be impacted by our credit ratings. 
 Independent rating agencies evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have assigned ratings for our long-term and short-term debt. If our credit ratings are lowered below investment grade, we may not be able to access the commercial paper market. If this occurs, we expect to borrow under our credit facility for our liquidity needs but at higher interest costs. Because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, our credit ratings could decline. If this were to occur, our borrowing costs could increase materially, and our access to sources of liquidity, including the commercial paper market, may be adversely affected.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings.
International sales have represented a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2021, 36% of our sales were generated by international operations, primarily in Europe, China, Canada, and Mexico. We expect that a significant amount of our sales will continue to come from outside the United States in the future. Nearly 50 of our manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. We are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations by our purchase of raw materials and component parts from suppliers in multiple countries. We experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2021, we had foreign exchange rate risk associated with the U.S. Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Danish Krone, Mexican Peso, Swiss Franc, and Polish Zloty. If these exchange rates devalue the currency we receive for the sale of our products, or the currency we use to purchase raw materials or component parts from our suppliers, it may have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings.
For more information regarding currency exchange rate risk, please refer to Note S on page 117 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact to the market demand for our products and our customers’ products, growth rates in the industries in which we participate, and opportunities in those industries.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic various governments, primarily impacting us in North America, Europe, and Asia, and elsewhere have instituted, and may reinstitute quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, or restrictions on public gatherings as well as limitations on social interactions. These restrictions and limitations have had, and could further have, an adverse effect on the economies and financial markets of the countries where our products, or our customers’ products, are sold. The resulting economic downturn has had, and could further have, an effect on the market demand for our products and our customers’ products, growth rates in the industries in which we participate, and opportunities in those industries. As a result of the decreased market demand, our trade sales, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, and financial condition have been and could be further materially negatively affected.
PART I

TECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY RISK FACTORS
Technology failures or cybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 131 production facilities in 18 different countries, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. We rely on several on-premise and cloud-based computerized systems and networks to obtain, secure, process, analyze, and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our production facilities. We receive, process, manufacture, and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors. We also have risk associated with the network connectivity and systems for consolidated reporting. Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure, including our industrial control systems, could impede normal operations, create system disruptions, or create unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. 
We have a formal process in place for both incident response and cybersecurity continuous improvement that includes a cross functional Cybersecurity Oversight Committee. Members of the Cybersecurity Oversight Committee update the Board of Directors quarterly on cyber activity, with procedures in place for interim reporting if necessary.
Although we have not experienced any material technology failures or cybersecurity breaches, we have enhanced our cybersecurity protection efforts over the last few years and continue to do so. We use a third party to periodically benchmark our information security program against the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework. We provide quarterly cybersecurity training for employees with access to our email and data systems, and we have purchased broad-form cyber insurance coverage. However, in part, because of the risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic regarding increased remote access, remote work conditions, and associated strain on employees, technology failures or cybersecurity breaches could still create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We cannot be certain that the attacker’s capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. We could still experience material technology failures or cybersecurity breaches, including those resulting from ransomware attached to our industrial control systems. If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information. Also, we may incur remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation and legal costs, reputational damages, proprietary and confidentiality impacts, damage to our competitiveness, and negative impact on our stock price and long-term shareholder value. 
TRADE RISK FACTORS
Tariffs by the United States government could result in materially lower margins, lost sales, and an overall adverse effect on our results of operations. 
While we frequently manufacture products where our customers are located, we do, in some cases, import and export various raw materials, components, or finished goods across several business units, including the Automotive and Bedding groups and the Machinery business. The United States has imposed broad-ranging tariffs on steel and aluminum (each of which we use in our manufacturing processes), a wide assortment of Chinese-made products, and other products on a country-specific basis. In retaliation, many other countries have imposed counter-tariffs on US-produced items. If we are unable to pass through additional costs created by these tariffs, it could result in materially lower margins, lost sales, and an overall adverse effect on our results of operations.
The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us.
In June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” In January 2020, the Withdrawal Agreement Act was passed by the UK Parliament and the Brexit deal was ratified by the EU Parliament. This allowed the UK to formally leave the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period through December 31, 2020, while the EU and UK were to negotiate a trade agreement, among other things. Additional negotiations among the EU and UK continue, as well as negotiations of trade agreements between the UK and other countries, including the United States. Because we have multiple manufacturing facilities in the UK, EU, and other countries, and these facilities purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers in those countries, and sell products into the UK, EU, and elsewhere, the results of Brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to our supply chain and distribution networks, tariff rates, and currencies, and could fluctuate the 
PART I

value of the British Pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. These disruptions and uncertainties could increase our costs and adversely affect us. 
REGULATORY RISK FACTORS
Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 
Governments around the world have adopted legislative and regulatory proposals concerning the collection and use of personal data. As a multi-national company with employee personal data and business contact information from individuals in many countries, we are subject to many different data protection laws, including those in the U.S., and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such as those in Europe, China, and Brazil. For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR applies to our operations that collect or process personal data of EU individuals and UK individuals, respectively. If our operations are found to violate GDPR or the UK GDPR, we may incur substantial fines, face reputational harm, and be required to change our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
As a U.S. company, the ability to centrally manage aspects of our operation and workforce and the ability to make decisions based on complete and accurate global data are important and require the ability to transfer and access personal data. The adequacy of the laws of the data-importing country are of increasing importance under various laws, including the GDPR, the UK GDPR, and Brazil’s general data protection law. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in many countries, including Brazil, Europe, China, and the U.S. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield in 2020, the complex assessment and documentation requirements required under the EU Commission's recent Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as the still evolving guidance from Brazil and China, could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data. This may inhibit our ability to transfer our employee personal data from our other operations, such as in Europe, China, and Brazil, to the Company’s headquarters in the U.S. or elsewhere, making it much more difficult to effectively manage our global human capital. These evolving privacy and data protection requirements create uncertainty and added compliance obligations that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Climate change laws, regulations, and impacts could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, competitive position, and reputation.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 131 production facilities worldwide. Some of our facilities are engaged in manufacturing processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. We also maintain a fleet of over-the-road tractor trailers that emit greenhouse gases. Climate change has received increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit such emissions. Either the enactment of, or change to existing laws and regulations, could mandate more restrictive standards or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. To the extent our customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions, which could adversely impact their demand for our products and services. Also, if these laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, they could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. In either event, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position. Non-compliance with climate change legislative and regulatory requirements could also negatively impact our reputation. 
Also, we have experienced, in part due to severe weather impacts, supply shortages in chemicals, which have restricted foam supply. The restriction of foam supply has constrained overall mattress production in the bedding industry and has reduced our production levels. The cost of chemicals and foam have also increased due to the shortages. If we are unable to secure an adequate supply of chemicals and foam, or the cost of these raw materials materially increases, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
PART I

We have also experienced increased property insurance premiums, in part, due to enhanced weather-related risks, but this increase in premiums has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. However, a more severe impact is possible.
Increased scrutiny from investors, lenders, and other market participants regarding our environmental, social, and governance, or sustainability responsibilities, could expose us to additional costs or risks and adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, employee retention, and stock price. 
Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants, shareholders, and customers have focused increasingly on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or “sustainability” practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, lender, or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our access to capital may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. These limitations, in both the debt and equity markets, may materially negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity, our ability to refinance existing debt, grow our businesses, implement our strategies, our results of operations, and the price of our common stock.
Our sustainability report details how we seek to manage our operations responsibly and ethically. The sustainability report includes our policies and practices on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, Board and management sustainability oversight, governance and ethics, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product sustainability and stewardship, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. In 2021, we broadened the scope of the Board’s Nominating, Governance and Sustainability Committee to include oversight of our ESG programs and related risks. We also added newly created positions, including our first Chief Human Resource Officer, ID&E Director, and Sustainability Manager to help lead and evaluate our ESG practices. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. In addition to the costs associated with the above mentioned positions, we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards set forth in the sustainability report could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us. Our sustainability report can be found at www.leggett.com. Our website does not constitute part of this Form 10-K. 
Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions pursuant to ongoing tax audits could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.
We are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state, and local) and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty. There have been proposals, notably by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and in the European Union, to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules. These proposals, if adopted, could significantly impact how our earnings and transactions are taxed as a multinational corporation. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will become law, or how they might be interpreted, such changes could impact our assumptions related to the taxation of certain foreign earnings and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.
We are currently in various stages of audit by the U.S. and foreign governmental taxing authorities. We have established liabilities as we believe are appropriate, with such amounts representing what we believe is a reasonable provision for taxes that we ultimately might be required to pay. However, these liabilities could be increased over time as more information becomes known relative to the resolution of these audits, as either certain governmental tax positions may be sustained on audit or we may agree to certain tax adjustments. We could incur additional tax expense if we have adjustments higher than the liabilities recorded.
LITIGATION RISK FACTORS
We are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Although we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have recorded an immaterial aggregate litigation contingency accrual at 
PART I

December 31, 2021. Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be $10 million. If our assumptions or analyses regarding any of our contingencies are incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $10 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information regarding our legal contingencies, please see Note T on page 119 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
