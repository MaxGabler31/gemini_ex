MAXD “The Secret Sauce”

The MAX-D Secret Sauce is an epic proprietary breakthrough and patented-process that uses advanced resynthesis to restore lost, compressed harmonics and bring true high definition (HD) live sound to digital media without affecting file size or energy consumption. Consumers have shown their love for MAX-D by previously downloading the MAX-D app from both app stores over a million times which occurred with an unprecedented zero marketing dollars campaign. A new Native App to all formats will be launched later in 2021 that will be greatly improved and is expected to generate significant revenue for MAX-D and its partners. Late summer and early fall of 2021 will feature the release of the cloud-based player version of MAX-D onto high traffic web platforms in mainstream Music, TV, Movies, eSports and Online Gaming with many of the brands consumers already know, use and pay for.

CONSUMERS WANT BETTER AUDIO

Consumers have unknowingly sacrificed better audio quality for portable convenience.

Throughout history, we have attempted to capture, enhance and reproduce audio. During past century almost every generation has used a different audio delivery system and player reproduce audio. Some advancements in "Audio" were superior and some were sub-par, most were more convenient but often had inferior quality.

The most commonly used digital audio file today is an MP3. The general population has sacrificed the audio quality for convenience.

MAX-D DELIVERY & IMPLEMENTATION

The MAX-D process is the ONLY true dynamic process with the ability to deliver Pure HD Audio on existing hardware in real time. MAX-D consumers have the ability to “customize” their playback - as everyone wants to hear their audio differently.

The MAX-D process is available in four different versions, they are:

1. MAX-D Cloud Player

2. MAX-D Smart Phone App

3. API (Application Program Interface)

4. MAX-D Software Program

MAX-D Cloud Player - The MAX-D Cloud Player is a full featured version of the MAX-D Technology that can be implemented on any streaming service, or online platform in a very short amount of time, with very little coding or development required. This allows MAX-D partners to quickly adopt MAX-D HD Audio with no hassle.

MAX-D Smart Phone App - The MAX-D APP is used on a Smartphone with a least a 1 GHz processor. Android and iOS versions will be available in the very near future. The APP is a full-featured player with all the controls you would expect. Included are: genre settings for the consumer to choose the type of audio, a bypass for on/off functionality so the consumer can hear and feel the MAX-D difference and a harmonic tone control with three dynamic ranges for further customization.

API (Application Program Interface) - Devices (Original Equipment Manufacturer). The API allows the OEM developers to design their own custom interface. NOTE: The genre presets can be customized by MAX SOUND if necessary for specific types or applications.

2. As of the end of Q-3, MAX-D was negotiating US Representation of one of the world's best rated Haptic Feedback Wearable devices, and as of November19, the Company was finalizing said US Representation.


Hende Moto
----------


After a final phase of due diligence completed on November 12, 2021, Max Sound discovered the assets claimed by Hende were indeed not directly owned. Since a deal was contingent on value and contacts that were unverifiable, we’ve gone in a different direction and terminated the acquisition. Because we couldn’t document Hende’s direct ownership, we are unable to complete any relationship mechanically.

Nonetheless, we established some presence in the relevant markets for the concept car that Max Sound was instrumental in creating. Max Sound has also sponsored Hende at the top 100 leaders in transportation event where the company was awarded for its innovative design. We intend to do a redesign including an upgraded audio solution for the supercar. The car will be a showcase for new technology that can be licensed to other manufacturers. We have no intention to be a manufacturer.

The resources to build this is expected to be available sometime in the first quarter. No further information can be provided at this time because we have yet to value in dollars and cents the investment of these projects or any future budgeting which will be refined and established in the first quarter 2022. Stay tuned.

Plan of Operation

We began our operations on October 8, 2008, when we purchased the Form 10 Company from the previous owners. Since that date, we have conducted financings to raise initial start-up money for the building of our internet search engine and social networking website and to start our operations. In 2011, the Company shifted the focus of its business operations from their social networking website to the marketing of the Max Sound HD Audio Technology and in 2014 the Company began litigations against Google and others for infringement of its technologies and associated legal rights to the various proprietary technologies.

The Company believes that Max Sound HD Audio Technology is a game changer for several vertical markets whose demand will create revenue opportunities in 2021.

On March 4, 2021, the Company signed a 10-year exclusive licensing agreement with TIP Solutions (Licensee) to implement the MAXD HD Audio Source Code into their mobile phone app and platforms. The Licensee was granted an exclusive license of MAX-D HD audio technology for an annual payment of $100,000 or $25,000 paid quarterly for up to 10 years.

The agreement also calls for a license fee split in the event the following occurs:


· | If Licensor is TIP - 20% of total license revenue received by TIP will be paid to Max Sound within 30 days of such receipts. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | If the Licensor is Max Sound and combined with TIP Solutions Smart Call Assistant, 20% of total license revenue received by Max Sound will be paid to TIP within 30 days.


On March 9, 2021, the Company received a $100,000 payment from the Licensee.

We expect our financial requirements to increase with the additional expenses needed to market and promote the MAX-D HD Audio Technology. We plan to fund these additional expenses through financings and through loans from our stockholders and/or officers based on existing lines of credit and we are also considering various private funding opportunities until such time that our revenue stream is adequate enough to provide the necessary funds.

Inground Assets™

We previously discussed our development of the precious minerals and metals database project in Africa as well as being negotiated elsewhere that we have named Inground Assets™. This is a paradigm shifting algorithm planned for introduction in Q-1, 2022 online as a Dutch Auction. Current versions contain and display some or all of the following data on command –

Historical repositories dating back to 100 years that produce bulletins documenting the exploration of precious minerals and metals, and catalog harvested minerals including what is still available in each mapping. Each country's rarest available minerals can be included as well, eg. antimony, tantalite, silver, uranium, emeralds, copper, tungsten, beryllium, and more as well as Location Mapping that identify specific areas with which minerals are still available for harvesting. Generatable short reports on every mineral will be available in each specific areas, precise coordinates of all available rare metals and minerals, which includes thousands of recommended targeted dig areas. All Location Mapping areas where Microchipped Raw Materials are reviewable. All tributaries, rivers, and dams in a country are digitized for quick use and analysis, including digitized mapping of mountains, roadways, and deposits of many rare metals and waterways.

Ongoing Discussions with Google

On September 2, 2021, the honorable Judge Latham of the United States Bankruptcy Court Southern District of California, approved a global settlement in the Chapter's 11 and 7 bankruptcy filing (case number 20-01894) of Greg Halpern - Max Sound Founder and CEO. Although there are more motions and procedures still to be completed over the next few months, we believe this is an extremely positive outcome to our future. In addition, there are ongoing positive discussions with Google on their related claim that we expect to result in an outcome economically beneficial to the company and its founder.
