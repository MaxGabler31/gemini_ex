Business of the Issuer.
 
Principal Products or Services and Markets and Distribution Methods.
 
The Company's parking enforcement system is an automated system which generates parking citations. The system consists of a hand-held, light-weight, portable data entry terminal, a light-weight printer to generate the parking citation and a data collection computer system to store parking citation data at the end of each day. The data is stored on in-house servers at the Company in a cloud-computing environment. The system allows users to print photos on the tickets as well as store the photos with the ticket records. Some clients will prefer to remain on the batch system. 
 
The Company's system also includes a complete back office processing and filing system. The Company provides computers, printers and software to enable the user to obtain State Department of Motor Vehicle lookups, maintain citation information storage and recall, generate delinquent notices and have immediate access to files of all tickets previously written. In addition, the Company's system maintains a current, readily accessible list of vehicles with multiple outstanding citations, stolen vehicles, or vehicles otherwise wanted by local law enforcement officials. The system also generates reports of citations by number and officer, revenues collected, names of scofflaws, officer productivity and other reports as deemed necessary or valuable to the agency.
 
The Company offers Internet payment processing of tickets, permit registrations, and clearing of funds for its clients and industry affiliates. The program accepts credit cards and checks at its Remit-online.com web site 24 hours a day. As the items are accepted, email notification goes immediately to the client for notification and posting of payment. Settlement of funds is weekly or monthly per contract arrangement.
 
Under the permit fulfillment program, patrons can purchase permits at on-line web addresses for specific agencies. Payment processing is done for checks and credit cards and the permits are mailed directly for the agencies.
 
The Company's contracts for its parking enforcement systems generally provide that the Company will provide the ticket writers, a back office processing system, custom software and training and support in consideration of a fee per citation issued, a monthly fee for computer equipment rental and/or a set monthly fee. Occasionally, the Company will provide its system through an outright sale rather than through its typical lease arrangement. The Company generally warrants its equipment, provides updating and improvements to its system hardware and software and provides customary indemnification. The Company also contracts its systems under a privatization program whereby the Company provides a complete facilities management program for the client. The operation includes personnel to operate the system, issue tickets, and take care of enforcement tasks, along with the collection of ticket revenues, backlog ticket collections and other related duties. These programs are offered under a revenue guarantee or revenue split contract.
 
The Company is providing full service programs to private parking industry clients. The programs include permit fulfillment, payment processing, generating notice letters and related full service programs.

The Company has had a great deal of interest in the program and sales are commencing on a regular basis. The program receives "excellent" ratings at download.com.
 
VirtualPermit.com
 
This program is a paperless (and hard copy) permit system now being used by many of the Company's clients. It includes monitoring lots and garages, inventory of spaces, and can validate active or lapsed permits.
 
Park-by-phone.com
 
This program is a technology based parking reservation and payment system that benefits customers by allowing them to pay (by credit card) and park by making one telephone call to the Park-by-phone data center. Through strategic alliances with parking operators, cities, and venues, this system allows customers to have paid parking in an instant, without the need of cash or coins.
 
Time IMS
 
The Company has also developed an internet based time keeping program geared to agencies that need to keep accurate employee tracking and time keeping records. The internet software system offers outservice agencies the ability to accurately track and document skilled and unskilled care visits. The program can also be used for general timekeeping purposes (i.e. hourly workers, part time staffing, and other personnel tracking).
 
Competition.
 
The Company is aware of other companies that currently offer an automated ticket writing system: Rhino Technologies, Inc.; Cardinal; Com-Plus; T-2, and others. The Company believes that it is able to compete effectively in the field because of its fee per citation and leased system marketing approach which eliminates any significant capital expenditures by the user, its excellent program for customer support and because of the various enforcement products which it offers to complement its system.
 
Initially, the Company provides potential parking control clients with consulting services to analyze the client's ticketing and enforcement needs. The Company then develops a proposal based upon those needs, which indicates how the Company's system and related products would aid the client in achieving the two primary goals of ticket writing and enforcement: creation of an equitable enforcement policy and an increase in revenues. The Company believes that a system which is perceived by the public to provide a greater certainty of enforcement will result in a greater willingness upon the part of the public to promptly and consistently pay fines, thus increasing the flow of revenues to the client. Depending upon the size of the client, the Company's services may range from the simple sale of hardware (i.e., the Denver Boot) to providing a ticketing and enforcement system and related equipment through a lease or sale arrangement, training users and handling data processing of tickets and the collection of fines. The Internet based services added to client programs as well as the Remit-online.com payment processing program makes the Company's system more comprehensive and advantageous than competitor systems.

Research and Development.
 
In order to keep its products and systems from becoming obsolete, the Company regularly modifies and updates its hardware and software. In order to streamline its ticket writing and car rental equipment, the Company has redesigned the printer so that it weighs less than two pounds. New battery technology has also allowed the Company to reduce the weight in the printers.
 
The Company produces a printer to interface to its handheld devices that is light weight (at 1 1/2 pounds) and can produce a completed ticket in 20 seconds.
 
The Company has developed a keyboard and cradle for Palm devices.
 
Management keeps informed of new developments in components so that the printer is up-to-date, fast and suits user requirements. The Company communicates with vendors on a regular and ongoing basis so that management is aware of upgraded components, new components and new processes to upgrade its hardware. By adapting its equipment to user needs and keeping current of the latest technology, the Company anticipates that its enforcement ticket writing and rental car systems will not become obsolete. The Company is currently developing new applications with the new printer and Palm computing devices which will move outside the parking and rental car industries. The Company's software was developed in-house by four full-time programmers and by the Company’s former President and director, and is maintained and updated on a regular basis.
 
The office computer software allows the daily ticket and rental and inventory information to be transferred from the portable units to a central computer. The information is compiled and then processed further according to user requirements.
 
Through sophisticated communications software developed internally, the Company is able to update, modify, repair, enhance and change most software at the client's location via a modem and the Internet.
 
None of the cost of such activities was borne directly by the customers.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws.
 
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have no material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company has entered into an arrangement with RBRC (Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation) for the recycling of all batteries.
 
The Company donates its used computer equipment to various churches. The program has been very successful as the computers are capable of early computer training programs even though they are no longer acceptable to operate the Company's systems.
