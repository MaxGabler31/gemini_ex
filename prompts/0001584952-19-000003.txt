ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
EP Energy Corporation (EP Energy), a Delaware corporation formed in 2013, is an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our strategy is to invest in opportunities that provide the highest return across our asset base, continually seek out operating and capital efficiencies, effectively manage costs, and identify accretive acquisition opportunities and divestitures, all with the objective of enhancing our portfolio, growing asset value, improving cash flow and increasing financial flexibility. 
We operate through a diverse base of producing assets and are focused on the development of our drilling inventory located in three areas: the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, Northeastern Utah (NEU), formerly Altamont, in the Uinta basin, and the Permian basin in West Texas. As of December 31, 2018, we had proved reserves of 324.5 MMBoe (52% oil and 70% liquids) and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we had average net daily production of 80,654 Boe/d (57% oil and 74% liquids).
Each of our areas is characterized by a long-lived reserve base and high drilling success rates. We have established significant contiguous leasehold positions in each area, representing approximately 457,000 net (596,000 gross) acres in total. 
In addition to opportunities in our current portfolio, strategic acquisitions of leasehold acreage or acquisitions of producing assets can allow us to leverage existing expertise in our operating areas, balance our exposure to regions, basins and commodities, help us achieve or enhance risk-adjusted returns competitive with those available in our existing programs and increase our reserves. We also continuously evaluate our asset portfolio and will sell oil and natural gas properties if they no longer meet our long-term objectives.
Liquidity Concerns
In May 2020, $182 million of our senior unsecured notes will mature. Based on our current forecasted EBITDAX
(assuming $55/barrel of oil), cash on hand, and remaining capacity under our reserve-based revolving credit facility (the RBL
Facility), we project that as of May 2020, we will not have sufficient liquidity available to repay these notes and meet our
working capital needs and/or fund our planned capital expenditures. In order to address this projected shortfall in liquidity, we
are evaluating certain other sources of incremental liquidity, including additional debt issuances or refinancings and asset sales.
If we are not successful in obtaining the necessary additional liquidity, whether through executing one or more of these
potential actions or otherwise, and/or if commodity prices do not appreciably increase prior to the filing date of our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2019, we would expect to disclose in that Quarterly Report that, in the absence of executing on these potential actions or commodity prices appreciably increasing, there would be substantial doubt that we would be able to continue as a going concern beginning in May 2020. In addition, should we be required to include a going concern disclosure in our year-end audited financial statements (in the absence of a waiver or other suitable relief), the disclosure would result in an event of default under the RBL Facility, after which the lenders thereunder could accelerate the outstanding indebtedness. An event of default under our RBL Facility could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt agreements, including our senior secured term loan and our senior secured and unsecured notes, which could also result in the acceleration of those obligations by the lenders thereunder. Even if we are able to implement such strategic alternatives, they may be insufficient to meet our debt and other obligations. Furthermore, such strategic alternatives may adversely affect our creditors or our existing stockholders, potentially resulting in the loss of all or substantially all of their investment in us.
Reserves Summary
The following table provides a summary of oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as of December 31, 2018 and production data for the year ended December 31, 2018 for each of our areas of operation.

(1) | Proved reserves were evaluated based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $65.56 per Bbl (WTI), $3.10 per MMBtu (Henry Hub) and $23.60 per Bbl of NGLs.


(2) | Includes 7 MMBoe of proved developed non-producing reserves representing 2% of total net proved reserves at December 31, 2018.

Approximately 226 MMBoe, or 70%, of our total proved reserves are proved developed producing assets, which generated average production of 80.7 MBoe/d in 2018 from approximately 1,744 wells. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 169 MMBbls of proved oil reserves, 60 MMBbls of proved NGLs reserves and 575 Bcf of proved natural gas reserves, representing 52%, 18% and 30%, respectively, of our total proved reserves. For both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, 74% of our production was related to oil and NGLs.  
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 95% of our producing wells. This control provides us with flexibility around the amount and timing of capital spending and has allowed us to improve our capital and operating efficiencies. We also employ a function-based organizational structure to accelerate knowledge sharing, innovation, evaluation and target efficiencies across our drilling, completion and operating activities across our operating areas. In 2018, we completed 136 wells and as of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 29 wells drilled, but not completed across our programs.
Our Properties
Eagle Ford Shale.  The Eagle Ford Shale, located in South Texas, is one of the premier unconventional oil plays in the United States. We were an early entrant into this play in late 2008, and since that time have acquired a leasehold position in the core of the oil window, primarily in La Salle County. The Eagle Ford formation in La Salle County has up to 125 feet of net thickness (165 feet gross). Due to its high carbonate content, the formation is also very brittle, and exhibits high productivity when fractured.  During 2018, we (i) completed acquisitions expanding our Eagle Ford acreage position by approximately 30 percent in La Salle County, for approximately $277 million and (ii) invested $425 million in capital (excluding approximately $315 million in acquisition capital). As of December 31, 2018, we had 119,705 net (130,293 gross) acres in the Eagle Ford.
 During 2018, we operated an average of three drilling rigs and as of December 31, 2018, we had 804 net producing wells (800 net operated wells) in this program. We are currently running three rigs in the Eagle Ford. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average net daily production was 37,067 Boe/d, representing an increase of 4% over the same period in 2017 due to improved well performance and additional capital allocated to this program in 2018.
Northeastern Utah.  The Northeastern Utah asset, formerly Altamont, is located in Duchesne and Uinta counties in the Uinta basin. The Uinta basin is characterized by naturally fractured, tight-oil sands and carbonates with multiple pay zones. Our operations are primarily focused on developing the NEU Complex, which is comprised of the Altamont, Bluebell and Cedar Rim fields. The NEU Complex has a gross pay interval thickness of over 4,300 feet and we believe the Wasatch and Green River formations are ideal targets for horizontal drilling and modern fracture stimulation techniques. Our commingled production is from over 1,500 feet of net stimulated rock. Historically, our activity has been focused on the development of our vertical inventory on 80-acre and 160-acre spacing; however, we also recently completed our first two horizontal wells with lateral lengths between 7,900 and 9,800 feet. Industry activity has focused on horizontal drilling in the Wasatch and Green River formations testing tight carbonate and sand intervals and has also piloted 80-acre vertical downspacing in these formations. Due to the largely held-by-production nature of our acreage position, if horizontal drilling continues to be successful, it will result in additional opportunities that could be added to our inventory of drilling locations.
We are subject to a drilling joint venture to accelerate and fund future oil and natural gas development in
NEU. Under the joint venture, our partner is participating in the development of 60 wells and will provide a capital carry
in exchange for a 50 percent working interest in the joint venture wells. As of December 31, 2018, we have drilled and completed 43 wells under the joint venture agreement.
During 2018, we (i) completed the sale of certain assets in NEU for approximately $177 million representing approximately 13 percent of our NEU acreage position and (ii) invested $120 million in capital in NEU (excluding approximately $2 million in acquisition capital). As of December 31, 2018, we had 155,314 net (282,885 gross) acres in NEU. 
During 2018, we operated an average of two drilling rigs in NEU. As of December 31, 2018, we had 348 net producing wells (342 net operated wells) and are currently running one rig in this program.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average net daily production was 17,051 Boe/d, representing a decrease of 4% over 2017 due to the sale of certain assets in NEU during the first quarter of 2018 as further discussed in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", Note 2. 
Permian.  The Permian basin is characterized by numerous stacked oil reservoirs (including the Wolfcamp A, B and C zones) that provide multiple targets for horizontal drilling. In 2009 and 2010, we leased 138,130 net (138,469 gross) acres on the University of Texas Land System in the Permian basin, located primarily in Reagan, Crockett, Upton and Irion counties. In 
2

2014, we acquired approximately 37,000 net acres in the Southern Midland basin. As of December 31, 2018, we had 182,114 net (183,031 gross) acres in the Permian.
We are party to a Consolidated Drilling and Development Unit Agreement with the University of Texas Land System in the Permian basin to provide flexibility to extend the time frame to hold our acreage through 2021, with an annual well completion requirement of 55 wells per year through 2020. For the years ended 2016 and 2017, we met our annual well completion requirement; however, we failed to meet this requirement in 2018. To the extent that we meet our annual well completion requirement, the wells completed during that year qualify for a variable royalty, which is determined using a rolling average six month price with royalty rates of 12.5% at an average price of $50 per Bbl (WTI) and below; 18.75% at an average price of $50.01 to $60 per Bbl (WTI); 25% at an average price of $60.01 to $80 per Bbl (WTI); and 28% above $80 per Bbl (WTI). Should we not meet our annual well completion requirement in a given year, the wells completed during that given year will not qualify for the variable royalty and instead be subject to a 25.00% royalty rate.
In 2017, we entered into a drilling joint venture to accelerate and fund future oil and natural gas development in the Permian basin.  Under the joint venture, our partner had the option to participate in the development of up to 150 wells in two separate 75 well tranches primarily in Reagan and Crockett counties. In April 2018, we amended this drilling joint venture agreement to direct the development area for the second tranche from the Permian to the Eagle Ford with anticipated joint venture investment in the Eagle Ford of $225 million. The first wells under the amended agreement began producing in the third quarter of 2018. We retain operational control of the joint venture assets. For a further discussion of this joint venture, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 11.
During 2018, we invested $99 million in capital (excluding approximately $23 million in capital adjustments under a joint venture agreement) in the Permian and operated an average of less than one drilling rig. As of December 31, 2018, we had 353 net producing wells (350 net operated wells). We are currently not running any rigs in this program.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average net daily production was 26,465 Boe/d, representing a decrease of 8% over 2017, reflecting the slower pace of development from reduced capital spending in 2018.  
The following table provides a summary of acreage and gross operated wells completed in each of the following areas as of December 31, 2018:

 | Acres | Gross Operated Wells Completed(#)
 | Gross | Net | 
Eagle Ford Shale | 130,293 | | 119,705 | 85

Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Reserves and Production
Proved Reserves
The proved oil and gas reserve estimates as of December 31, 2018 presented in the table below have been prepared by Ryder Scott Company L.P. (Ryder Scott), our independent third party reserve engineers. The reserve data represents only estimates, which are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, and is consistent with estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies except for differences of less than 5% resulting from actual production, acquisitions, property sales, necessary reserve revisions and additions to reflect actual experience. The risks and uncertainties associated with estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves are discussed further in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at December 31, 2018.

(1) | Proved reserves were evaluated based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $65.56 per Bbl (WTI), $3.10 per MMBtu (Henry Hub) and $23.60 per Bbl of NGLs. For a further discussion of our proved reserves and changes therein, see Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations.


(2) | Includes 226 MMBoe of proved developed producing reserves representing 70% of total net proved reserves and 7 MMBoe of proved developed non-producing reserves representing 2% of total net proved reserves at December 31, 2018.

The table below presents net proved reserves as reported and sensitivities related to our estimated proved reserves based on differing price scenarios as of December 31, 2018.

 | Net Proved Reserves(MMBoe)
As Reported | 324.5 
10 percent increase in commodity prices | 330.4 
10 percent decrease in commodity prices | 316.5 

The sensitivities in the table above were based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $65.56 per barrel of oil (WTI), $3.10 per MMBtu of natural gas (Henry Hub) and $23.60 per Bbl of NGLs used to determine net proved reserves at December 31, 2018.
Ryder Scott prepared 100% (by volume) of our total net proved developed and undeveloped (PUD) reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Ryder Scott in evaluating and preparing estimates of our net proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 complied with current SEC regulations. Ryder Scott’s report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The technical person at Ryder Scott primarily responsible for overseeing the reserves evaluation and preparation has a B.S. degree in chemical engineering. He is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has more than 15 years of experience in petroleum reserves evaluation.

The significant assumptions used in the proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by Ryder Scott were also assessed by our internal reserve team. Our internal reserve team is comprised of a technical staff of engineers and geoscientists 
4

that perform technical analysis of each undeveloped location. The staff uses industry accepted practices to estimate, with reasonable certainty, the economically producible oil and natural gas. The practices for estimating hydrocarbons in place include, but are not limited to, mapping, seismic interpretation of two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional data, core analysis, mechanical properties of formations, thermal maturity, well logs of existing penetrations, correlation of known penetrations, decline curve analysis of producing locations with significant production history, well testing, static bottom hole testing, flowing bottom hole pressure analysis and pressure and rate transient analysis.
Our primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing our reserves estimates has a B.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He leads the reservoir engineering evaluation and strategic planning groups of the company.  In this capacity, he oversees the reserve reporting and technical support groups. He has eight years of industry experience in various engineering and management roles. For a discussion of the internal controls over our proved reserves estimation process, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates”.
In general, the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire additional properties with proved reserves, or both, our proved reserves will decline as they are produced. Recovery of PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but future events, including commodity price changes, may cause these assumptions to change. In addition, estimates of PUD reserves and proved non-producing reserves are inherently subject to greater uncertainties than estimates of proved producing reserves. For further discussion of our reserves, see Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)
As of December 31, 2018, we have 91 MMBoe of PUD reserves in the Eagle Ford and NEU. Estimated capital expenditures to develop our PUD reserves (convert PUD reserves to proved developed reserves) are based upon a long-range plan approved by our management team and reviewed with the Board of Directors. All PUD locations are surrounded by producing properties, and a majority of our PUDs directly offset a producing property. Where we have recorded PUDs beyond one location away from a producing property, reasonable certainty of economic producibility has been established by reliable technology in our areas, including field tests that demonstrate consistent and repeatable results within the formation being evaluated.
Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2018 reflect the effects of adjusting our PUD bookings methodology from a five-year to a three-year timeframe as a result of (i) the current economic price environment, (ii) a lower projected capital budget in 2019, and (iii) our available liquidity and access to the capital markets. Given our current financial situation with limited available liquidity, our PUD reserves of 91 MMboe at December 31, 2018 reflect only a three-year development timframe. The table below includes 64 MMBoe (29 MMBoe to extensions and discoveries, 4 MMBoe to acquisitions, and 31 MMBoe to revisions other than price) of negative adjustments in 2018 when calculating each respective category as a result of determining our PUDs using a three-year timeframe instead of a five-year timeframe. 
The following table summarizes our changes in PUDs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively (in MMBoe): 

Balance, December 31, 2016 | 227.8 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 15.1 | 
Revisions due to prices | 1.4 | 
Revisions other than prices | (23.4 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (30.7 | )
Divestitures | (16.4 | )
Balance, December 31, 2017 | 173.8 | 
Extensions and discoveries | — | 
Acquisitions | 12.5 | 
Revisions due to prices | 0.1 | 
Revisions other than prices | (65.6 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (22.6 | )
Divestitures | (7.3 | )
Balance, December 31, 2018 | 90.9 |

Revisions due to prices represent PUD revisions due to increases or decreases in commodity prices (using SEC 12-month average pricing). For the year ended December 31, 2018, revisions to PUDs other than prices primarily include negative revisions of 74 MMBoe due to a reallocation of capital from the Permian to other development areas and positive revisions of 12 MMBoe associated with increased drilling activity in the Eagle Ford and NEU. 
Extensions and discoveries in 2017 are primarily related to drilling activities across all areas. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revisions to PUDs other than prices include, among other items, negative revisions of 23 MMBoe due to a reallocation of capital in our development areas; a negative PUD ownership reversion of 10 MMBoe as a result of our variable royalty agreement in the Permian; a positive revision of 10 MMBoe from improved operating expenses and planned development of longer lateral PUDs; and the divestiture of 16 MMBoe is related to drilling joint ventures we entered into during 2017. 
The year ended December 31, 2018 includes 4 MMBoe of PUDs that have a positive undiscounted value, but a negative value when discounted at 10 percent. The majority of these PUDs become negative at a 10 percent discount rate due to the historically lower resource potential in this area. However, recent 2018 results prove this area to be much more prospective than currently modeled. We expect these wells to be economic with current results and assumptions.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016 we spent approximately $444 million, $377 million and $281 million, respectively, to convert approximately 13% or 23 MMBoe, 13% or 31 MMBoe and 9% or 25 MMBoe, respectively, of our prior year-end PUD reserves to proved developed reserves.  In 2019, 2020 and 2021 we estimate we will spend approximately $280 million, $564 million and $607 million to develop our PUD reserves, respectively, based on our December 31, 2018 reserve report. At this level of spending from 2019 through 2021, and based on our current liquidity projections and ability to fund capital expenditures in our long-range plan, and expected access to capital market transactions, we have the intent to develop 100% of our existing PUD reserves within a three-year period. The actual amount and timing of our forecasted expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, oilfield service costs, technology, acreage position, availability of capital and future commodity prices, which in the future could be lower than those in our projected long-range plan.

(1) | Gross interest reflects the total acreage we participate in regardless of our ownership interest in the acreage.


(2) | Net interest is the aggregate of the fractional working interests that we have in the gross acreage.

Our net developed acreage is concentrated in Texas (40%) and Utah (59%). Our net undeveloped acreage is concentrated in Texas (63%), Utah (14%), West Virginia (11%) and Wyoming (9%). Approximately 4%, 2% and 5% of our net undeveloped acreage is held under leases that have minimum remaining primary terms expiring in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We employ various techniques to manage the expiration of leases, including drilling the acreage ourselves prior to lease expiration, entering into farm-out or joint development agreements with other operators or extending lease terms.

Acquisition, Development and Exploration Expenditures
See Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations in the Total Costs Incurred table for details on our acquisition, development and exploration expenditures.
Transportation, Markets and Customers
Our marketing strategy seeks to ensure maximum deliverability of our physical production at the maximum realized prices. We leverage knowledge of markets and transportation infrastructure to enter into beneficial downstream processing, treating and marketing contracts. We primarily sell our domestic oil and natural gas production to third parties at spot market prices, while we sell our NGLs at market prices under monthly or long-term contracts. We typically sell our oil production to a relatively small number of creditworthy counterparties, as is customary in the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2018, nine purchasers accounted for approximately 90% of our oil revenues. The top two purchasers are: Shell Trading U.S. Co. (an affiliate of Shell Oil Company) and Flint Hills Resources, LP (an affiliate of Koch Industries), which together accounted for approximately 41% of our oil revenues. Across all of our areas, we maintain adequate gathering, treating, processing and transportation capacity, as well as downstream sales arrangements, to accommodate our production volumes.
In our Eagle Ford Shale area, we are connected to the Camino Real oil gathering system and to the NuStar Energy system.  The vast majority of our oil production flows on Camino Real, a 68-mile long pipeline with over 110,000 Bbls/d of capacity and a gravity bank that allows for oil blending to maintain attractive API levels. We have 80,000 Bbls/d of firm capacity on this oil system, of which we utilized an average of 35% during December 2018 and 36% on average for the year.  The system delivers oil to the Storey Oil Terminal east of Cotulla, Texas, southeast of Gardendale, Texas.  From the Storey Oil Terminal, oil can be pumped into Harvest’s Arrowhead #1 and/or #2 pipelines, as well as the Plains All American Pipeline connection to the Gardendale Hub.  Oil can also be loaded into trucks out of the Storey Oil Terminal or out of the numerous central tank batteries throughout our field, providing additional deliverability, reliability and flexibility.  We currently market our oil either at the Storey Oil Terminal, Gardendale or at our central tank batteries under a combination of short and long-term contracts, ranging from monthly deals to multi-year term sales. With adequate takeaway capacity in the region and close proximity to the Gulf Coast refining complex, we believe we have sufficient capacity on our contracts and do not anticipate any issues with marketing and delivering volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale. 
Our Eagle Ford natural gas production flows on either the Camino Real gas gathering system or the Frio LaSalle Pipeline system with the majority flowing on the Camino Real gas gathering system. The Camino Real gas gathering system receives high-pressure, unprocessed wellhead gas into an 83-mile pipeline with capacity up to 150 MMcf/d.  The gas is then redelivered into interconnects with ETC Texas Pipeline LTD, Enterprise Hydrocarbons LP, Regency Energy Partners LP and Eagle Ford Gathering LLC.  We currently have 125 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on Camino Real, of which we used an average of 56% during December 2018 and 45% on average for the year, and we have additional capacity available as needed.  We have firm gas gathering, processing and transportation agreements on three of the interconnected gas pipelines downstream of the Camino Real system, with a minimum capacity of approximately 100 MMBtu/d and rights to increase firm capacity as necessary.  In addition, gas produced from our northwest acreage position within the Eagle Ford area is connected to the Frio LaSalle Pipeline system, which provides access to firm H2S treating and processing.  Frio LaSalle can either return gas to the Camino Real system or, after processing, deliver to various Texas intrastate pipelines and a mix of interstates, such as Texas Eastern Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and Transco. We market our physical gas to various purchasers at spot market prices. 
In NEU, the wax crude we produce is sold at the wellhead to multiple purchasers who transport the oil via truck to downstream refineries. We sell most of the oil we produce in the basin to Salt Lake City refineries under long-term sales agreements that accommodate our production forecasts. Our produced natural gas is gathered and processed at the Altamont plant, a third-party-owned processing facility, under a long-term sales agreement that provides for residue gas return for operational use. 
In the Permian basin, we continue to leverage significant legacy gathering, processing and transportation infrastructure. For natural gas, we are connected to the West Texas Gas (WTG), DCP Midstream LP, Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent WestTex LLC and Cogent Midstream, LLC gathering systems, and we process a majority of our gas at the WTG Benedum & Sonora gas plants. We receive Waha pricing for our natural gas and Mt. Belvieu pricing for our NGLs. Our crude oil production facilities are connected to a third party oil gathering system that delivers to a Plains All American Pipeline at Owens Station in Reagan County, Texas, the Centurion Cline Shale Pipeline at Barnhart in Irion County, Texas and to the Magellan Longhorn pipeline in Crockett County, Texas. We sell our pipeline delivered crude to multiple purchasers under both short and long-term contracts at WTI-based pricing. We also maintain the capability to truck crude oil to those same purchasers under similarly-priced contracts to provide additional flow assurance. Given current Permian basin takeaway capacity, we anticipate no limitations moving physical crude oil to market.

While most of our physical production is priced off spot market indices, we actively manage the volatility of spot market pricing through our risk management program. We enter into financial derivatives contracts on our oil, natural gas and a portion of our NGLs production to stabilize our cash flows, reduce the risk of downward commodity price movements and protect the economic assumptions associated with our capital investment program. We employ a disciplined risk management program that utilizes risk control processes. For a further discussion of these risk management activities and derivative contracts, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Competitors
The exploration and production business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional oil and natural gas reserves and in the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our competitors include major and intermediate sized oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas operators and individual producers or operators with varying scopes of operations and financial resources. Competitive factors include financial resources, price and contract terms, our ability to access drilling, completion and other equipment and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel on a timely and cost effective basis. Ultimately, our future success in this business will be dependent on our ability to find and/or fund the acquisition and development of additional reserves at costs that yield acceptable returns on the capital invested.
Use of 3-D Seismic Data
Within our areas we have an inventory of approximately 1,473 square miles of 3-D seismic data providing approximately 49% coverage of our leased acreage in those areas. We use our 3-D seismic data to improve our geologic models for each area. In the Eagle Ford and the Permian, detailed maps of structural features (e.g., natural fractures, faulting and stratigraphic discontinuities) are used to position well bore laterals to optimally exploit oil bearing zones and navigate drilling hazards. In NEU, data analytics are run using 3-D seismic attributes to identify ideal locations in the reservoir and estimate resource distribution. Seismic data sets are continually updated to keep pace with technological advancements in seismic processing. 
Regulatory Environment
Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are regulated at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. These regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the drilling and spacing of wells, conservation, forced pooling and protection of correlative rights among interest owners.  We are also subject to various governmental safety and environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our operations under federal oil and natural gas leases are regulated by the statutes and regulations of the Department of the Interior (DOI) that currently impose liability upon lessees for the cost of environmental impacts resulting from their operations. Royalty obligations on all federal leases are regulated by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue within the DOI, which has promulgated valuation guidelines for the payment of royalties by producers. These laws and regulations affect the construction and operation of facilities, water disposal rights and drilling operations, among other items.  In addition, we maintain insurance to limit exposure to sudden and accidental pollution liability exposures.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a process of pumping fluid and proppant (usually sand) under high pressure into deep underground geologic formations that contain recoverable hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbon formations are typically thousands of feet below the surface. The hydraulic fracturing process creates small fractures in the hydrocarbon formation. These fractures allow natural gas and oil to move more freely through the formation to the well and finally to the surface production facilities. We use hydraulic fracturing to maximize productivity of our oil and natural gas wells in our areas, and our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves will be developed using hydraulic fracturing. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred costs of approximately $282 million associated with hydraulic fracturing.
Hydraulic fracturing fluid is typically composed of over 99% water and proppant. The other 1% or less of the fluid is composed of additives that may contain acid, friction reducer, surfactant, gelling agent and scale inhibitor. We retain service companies to conduct such operations and we have worked with several service companies to evaluate, test and, where appropriate, modify our fluid design to reduce the use of chemicals in our fracturing fluid. We have worked closely with our service companies to provide voluntary and regulatory disclosure of our hydraulic fracturing fluids.
In order to protect surface and groundwater quality during the drilling and completion phases of our operations, we follow applicable industry practices and legal requirements of the applicable state oil and natural gas commissions with regard to well design, including requirements associated with casing steel strength, cement strength and slurry design. Our activities in the field are monitored by state and federal regulators. Key aspects of our field protection measures include: (i) pressure testing well construction and integrity, (ii) casing and cementing practices to ensure pressure management and separation of hydrocarbons from groundwater, and (iii) public disclosure of the contents of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
10

In addition to these measures, our drilling, casing and cementing procedures are designed to prevent fluid migration and typically include some or all of the following:

• | Our drilling process executes several repeated cycles conducted in sequence—drill, set casing, cement casing and then test casing and cement for integrity before proceeding to the next drilling interval.


• | Conductor casing is drilled and cemented or driven in place. This string serves as the structural foundation for the well. Conductor casing is not necessary or required for all wells.


• | Surface casing is set and is cemented in place. Surface casing is set on all wells. The purpose of the surface casing is to isolate and protect Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDW) as identified by federal and state regulatory bodies. The surface casing and cement isolates wellbore materials from any potential contact with USDWs.


• | Intermediate casing is set through the surface casing to a depth necessary to isolate abnormally pressured subsurface formations from normally pressured formations. Intermediate casing is not necessary or required for all wells. Our standard practices include cementing above any hydrocarbon bearing zone and performing casing pressure tests to verify the integrity of the casing and cement.


• | Production casing is set through the surface and intermediate casing through the depth of the targeted producing formation. Our standard practices include pumping cement above the confining structure of the target zone and performing casing pressure tests and other tests to verify the integrity of the casing and cement. If any problems are detected, then appropriate remedial action is taken.


• | With the casing set and cemented, a barrier of steel and cement is in place that is designed to isolate the wellbore from surrounding geologic formations. This barrier as designed mitigates against the risk of drilling or fracturing fluids entering potential sources of drinking water.

In addition to the required use of casing and cement in the well construction, we follow additional regulatory requirements and industry operating practices. These typically include pressure testing of casing and surface equipment and continuous monitoring of surface pressure, pumping rates, volumes of fluids and chemical concentrations during hydraulic fracturing operations. When any pressure differential outside the normal range of operations occurs, pumping is shut down until the cause of the pressure differential is identified and any required remedial measures are completed. Hydraulic fracturing fluid is delivered to our sites in accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations in DOT approved shipping containers using DOT transporters.
We also have procedures to address water use and disposal. This includes evaluating surface and groundwater sources, commercial sources, and potential recycling and reuse of treated water sources. When commercially and technically feasible, we use recycled or treated water. This practice helps mitigate against potential adverse impacts to other water supply sources. When using raw surface or groundwater, we obtain all required water rights or compensate owners for water consumption. We are evaluating additional treatment capability to augment future water supplies at several of our sites. During our drilling and completions operations, we manage waste water to minimize environmental risks and costs. Flowback water returned to the surface is typically contained in steel tanks or pits. Water that is not treated for reuse is typically piped or trucked to waste disposal injection wells, a number of which we operate. These wells are permitted through the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). We also use commercial UIC permitted water injection facilities for flowback and produced water disposal.
We have not received regulatory citations or notice of suits related to our hydraulic fracturing operations for environmental concerns. We have not experienced a surface release of fluids associated with hydraulic fracturing that resulted in material financial exposure or significant environmental impact. Consistent with local, state and federal requirements, releases are reported to appropriate regulatory agencies and site restoration completed. No remediation reserve has been identified or anticipated as a result of hydraulic fracturing releases experienced to date.
Spill Prevention/Response Procedures. There are various state and federal regulations that are designed to prevent and respond to any spills or leaks resulting from exploration and production activities. In this regard, we maintain spill prevention control and countermeasures programs, which frequently include the installation and maintenance of spill containment devices designed to contain spill materials on location. In addition, we maintain emergency response plans to minimize potential environmental impacts in the event of a spill or leak or any significant hydraulic fracturing well control issue.
