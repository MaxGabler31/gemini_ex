ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
With a gaming footprint that includes 44 properties across 20 states as of December 31, 2021, Penn National is a highly innovative omni-channel provider of retail casino gaming, online gaming, live racing, sports betting, and digital sports content. Our wholly-owned interactive division, Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC (“Penn Interactive”), operates retail sports betting in the Company’s retail properties, as well as online sports betting and online social casino, bingo, and iCasino products (collectively, “iGaming”). In October 2021, we acquired Score Media and Gaming, Inc. (“theScore”), a sports betting and digital media company. In addition, in February 2020, we entered a strategic partnership with Barstool Sports, Inc. (“Barstool Sports”), a leading digital sports, entertainment, lifestyle and media company. Combined with the power of theScore and Barstool Sports, Penn National has evolved into a leading North American digital sports content, gaming and technology company. The Company’s omni-channel approach is further bolstered by its mychoice customer loyalty program (the “mychoice program”), which rewards and recognizes its over 25 million members for their loyalty to both retail and online gaming and sports betting products with a dynamic set of industry offers, experiences, and service levels.
Reportable Segments
We have five reportable segments: Northeast, South, West, Midwest, and Interactive. Our retail gaming and racing properties are grouped into reportable segments by geographic region and each property is viewed as an operating segment except for our two properties in Jackpot, Nevada, which are viewed as one operating segment. We also consider our combined Video Gaming Terminal (“VGT”) operations, by state, to be separate operating segments. Interactive includes the operations of Penn Interactive, theScore, and our proportionate share of earnings attributable to Barstool Sports. See Note 18, “Segment Information,” for further information.

In connection with the acquisition of the membership interests in Greektown Holdings, LLC on May 23, 2019, the Company entered into the Greektown Lease with VICI for the real estate assets used in the operations of Greektown Casino-Hotel. Both the Margaritaville Lease and the Greektown Lease have initial terms of 15 years, with four subsequent five-year renewal options on the same terms and conditions, exercisable at the Company’s option.
Tropicana Lease
On April 16, 2020, we sold the real estate assets associated with the operations of Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Inc. (“Tropicana”) property to a subsidiary of GLPI in exchange for rent credits of $307.5 million. Contemporaneous with the sale, the Company entered into a leaseback of the real estate assets for nominal cash rent. We are required to continue to operate the Tropicana for two years (subject to three one-year extensions at GLPI’s option) or until the real estate assets and the operations of the Tropicana are sold by GLPI. On January 11, 2022, Penn National entered into a definitive purchase agreement to sell its outstanding equity interest in Tropicana, which has the gaming license and operates the Tropicana, to Bally’s Corporation (“Bally’s”). This transaction is expected to close within the second half of 2022, subject to Penn National, GLPI, and Bally’s entering into definitive agreements and obtaining regulatory approval.
Trademarks
We own a number of trademarks and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), including but not limited to, “Ameristar®,” “Argosy®,” “Boomtown®,” “Greektown®,” “Hollywood Casino®,” “Hollywood Gaming®,” “L’Auberge®,” “M Resort®,” “Tropicana Las Vegas,” and “My Choice®” (“mychoice”) among other trademarks. We believe that our rights to our trademarks are well-established and have competitive value to our properties. We also have a number of trademark applications pending with the USPTO.
Among others, we have a licensing agreement with a third-party to use the “Margaritaville®” trademark in connection with the operations of Margaritaville in Bossier City, Louisiana. Upon closing of the transaction with Barstool Sports in February 2020, we have the sole right to utilize the Barstool Sports® brand for all our online and retail sports betting and iGaming products. 
Competition
The gaming, media and entertainment industries are characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants. In a broad sense, both our land-based and interactive gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to those in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. Competition is discussed in further detail within “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and a discussion of the impact of competition on our results of operations, and cash flows is included within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Gaming Issues
The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our properties is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. For a more detailed description of the statutes and regulations to which we are subject, see Exhibit 99.1, “Description of Government Regulations,” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Our businesses are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop diverse and high quality talent. Our commitment to an equal-opportunity and respectful workplace characterized by both diversity and inclusion, in which everyone feels valued, respected and supported, is a factor driving our success. Our talent and development programs are designed to develop, support and maintain talent succession pipelines in preparation for key roles and leadership positions; recognize, reward and support our team members through competitive pay and wellness programs; enhance the Company’s philanthropic culture by encouraging participation and championing programs in the communities in which we work and live; and invest in technology and resources to provide our team members with the most efficient tools to perform their jobs.
Some of the key programs and initiatives developed to attract, retain and develop diverse and high quality talent include:
•Executive and High Potential Talent Review Process
•Diversity and Veteran Recruitment Initiatives
•AwardCo Recognition Program and Property Engagement Committees
•Emerging Leaders Program
Through the dedicated efforts of our Corporate and property leadership teams, our charitable Foundation and the PENN Diversity Committee, we launched a number of major new initiatives in 2021 that will help to improve the lives of our team members, their families and those in need in our communities.
Highlights from last year’s efforts include the launch of a $4 million STEM Scholarship Fund and internship program at historically black colleges and universities in states in which we operate. In addition, we started a new pilot program to help mentor and develop our hourly and early career team members who want to pursue leadership positions at our Company. We also kicked off our annual $1 Million Diversity Scholarship Program for the children of team members and are now reviewing applications for the 2022-2023 school year. In our inaugural year, we awarded over $1 million in scholarships to 58 individuals, the majority of whom were first generation college students.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 21,973 full-time and part-time employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had 43 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4,341 active employees. Four collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire in 2022. Although we believe that we have good employee relations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or enter into replacement agreements. If we are able to extend or enter into replacement agreements, there can be no assurance as to whether the terms will be on comparable terms to the existing agreements.
