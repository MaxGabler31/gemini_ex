 aiWARE
 Today, over 80% of new data created worldwide is unstructured, which is increasing at an annual growth rate of 30-60% per year, according to Gartner (2020 Strategic Roadmap for Storage, July 1, 2020). This creates significant challenges for companies and governments across the globe, including how to create systematic solutions to address the ever-increasing volume of unstructured data.  Whether it is a local police department trying to rapidly solve crimes through analysis of video evidence, a media company searching years of television archives for specific images and video content, or the U.S. military trying to analyze huge volumes of satellite and other aerial images, we believe AI is the only efficient solution to these complex challenges.  
 1

To address the ever-growing challenges surrounding unstructured data, we developed aiWARE, our proprietary AI operating system.  aiWARE orchestrates AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. aiWARE offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction, problem solving and optimization, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and analyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights. 
 aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a future proof, scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged by organizations in a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data, together with structured data, such as the media and entertainment, government, legal and compliance, energy and other vertical markets, driving down the cost, complexity and time to develop, deploy and distribute AI-enabled applications in their operations. Our aiWARE platform is offered primarily through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) delivery model and can be deployed in a number of environments and configurations to meet customers’ needs.
 
Our aiWARE platform encompasses the following: 
  
• | Ingestion. We have built a scalable, source and type agnostic ingestion process that utilizes adapters, which are lightweight, pluggable software modules based on docker microservices, to capture a wide range of unstructured data, such as audio files, video files, images and documents, as well as structured data, such as public and private databases, from wherever they reside, to ingest them into our platform and normalize them for further processing, correlation and analytics. The open architecture of our solution also enables external developers to write these adapters to extend the platform to be able to ingest data of any type and from any source for their particular use cases. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Orchestration and Cognitive Processing. Source data ingested into aiWARE can be processed through one or more AI models, which extract from and/or add useful metadata to structured and unstructured data. Our platform includes an innovative, open AI ecosystem that currently incorporates hundreds of AI models across over 20 different cognitive capabilities from multiple third-party vendors, including Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others, as well as our own proprietary AI models, which use advanced algorithms to perform a variety of cognitive processes, including transcription, language translation, face detection, face recognition, object detection, object recognition, logo recognition, sentiment analysis, text keyword/topic analysis, audio/video fingerprinting, geolocation, visual moderation and optical character recognition, among others. Our open architecture allows us and third-party developers to easily integrate additional AI models within aiWARE, which makes our solution readily scalable for a broad range of processes and vertical markets.

• | Proprietary Indexing and Storage. The results of processed data are indexed and stored in a scalable, time-correlated temporal elastic database within aiWARE. This intelligent data lake gives us the unique ability to synthesize various disparate cognitive results in a cohesive, time-based format, and to dissect and analyze this information, producing a multi-dimensional index for ease of search, discovery and analytics, allowing users to access multivariate intelligence previously unattainable from their data. Our architecture leverages several commercial, open source, distributed and non-relational databases with proven scalability and performance characteristics. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integration. Through our self-service development environment, developers, including end customers, system integrators and application developers, can access our application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and developer tools, including Automate Studio, to rapidly build, integrate, deploy and operate AI models and AI-powered workflows and applications on aiWARE to satisfy specific use cases. Automate Studio is our low-code workflow designer that provides an intuitive drag-and-drop user interface to allow users to easily create intelligent workflows that leverage aiWARE’s scalable, event-driven architecture and ecosystem of AI models, to design and operationalize AI-powered business processes at scale, without the need for in-depth coding skills or AI expertise. In addition, we recently integrated aiWARE with Alteryx, Inc.’s (“Alteryx”) analytic process automation platform. Our AI tools are available for download by Alteryx users, allowing users to access and run our AI models within Alteryx and blend both structured data and unstructured data, including video, images, audio, sensor data, and text, to generate rapid AI-enabled analytics for greater insights and more informed decision making.

• | Applications and Cognitive Analytics. We have developed a suite of core applications and several industry targeted applications, which are discussed in more detail below, to facilitate the use of our platform and enable users to unlock actionable insights from their diverse datasets. As noted above, the modular structure of aiWARE enables rapid development and deployment of applications that are relevant to the specific needs of different markets. This allows us and third parties to quickly and easily build and deploy new applications on top of our aiWARE architecture or integrate existing applications with aiWARE. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 aiWARE is available through multiple deployment models that can be configured to meet each customer’s specific requirements.  These deployment models include fully cloud-based options hosted by us in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) commercial and secure government cloud environments; on-premises options, which allow users to utilize aiWARE’s cognitive processing and certain other capabilities in their controlled environment; and hybrid cloud/on-premises options, which give users of our on-premises capabilities the option to also connect to our services in the cloud, either to provision additional services to run within their controlled environment, or to use our additional cloud-based services to process data, search and analyze the results.  We currently hold an Authorization to Operate (“ATO”) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”) for our AWS secure government cloud platform to support government customers.
 Our current architecture gives us the flexibility to deploy many of aiWARE’s capabilities in virtually any environment, including select arm64 architectures, with improved scalability and reliability. We are continuing to enhance the portability of aiWARE in order to provide substantially all of the features and functionality of the platform within any environment to meet our customers’ needs.
 Markets in Which We Operate
 In 2021, we realigned our organization to focus on two distinct markets: Commercial Enterprise, or CE, and Government & Regulated Industries, or GRI. We have developed several applications and services addressing specific customer use cases within these target markets.  We intend to leverage the capabilities that we have developed for these key markets to expand into other markets in the future.  We have identified numerous ways in which our aiWARE platform and related AI technology may be used to extract valuable insights from large volumes of data to solve real-world problems across a broad range of markets and applications.

 Government and Regulated Industries
 GRI today consists of customers in government and regulated industries, including our state, local and federal government, legal, compliance and energy customers. To date, a smaller portion of our historical revenue is generated from GRI customers; however, we believe that there are tremendous near and long term opportunities to grow our business in the GRI markets.  The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence final report published in 2021 recommended that Congress fund $14 billion in Department of Defense AI initiatives and also called for doubling non-defense AI R&D to reach $36 billion by 2026. The U.S. General Services Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center have been created to speed the adoption of AI technologies by civilian and defense agencies, respectively, and the U.S. Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs have opened their own AI research offices. In the energy market, according to Frost and Sullivan (Growth Opportunities from Decarbonization in the Global Power Market, 2019-2030), it is estimated that $3.4 trillion will be invested in renewable energy over the next 10 years.  We believe that the applicability of our AI solutions will extend beyond utilities and across the global $1.5 trillion electric energy market (inspirecleanenergy.com, Understanding the Energy Market, March 2017), including improved optimization to reduce energy production lost, which we have estimated to be over $21 billion in the U.S. annually over the last 10 years based on data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Frequently Asked Questions, https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/index.php).
 We also believe there are increasing opportunities to provide our AI-powered solutions to address the needs of customers in the state and local government, legal and compliance markets, including law enforcement, legal and judicial professionals, and companies and regulatory bodies in highly regulated industries.  Law enforcement and other government agencies regularly accumulate large amounts of unstructured audio and video data, including from police body cameras, police car recorders, interview room cameras, 911 audio tapes and surveillance cameras.  Historically, in most cases, investigators have had to review audio and video data manually, a task that consumes huge amounts of time and delays investigations.  In addition, public agencies are required to provide certain information, including in many cases audio and video files, in response to requests from the public.  Recently, statutes in several states have broadened the scope of information required to be disclosed and have shortened the time periods in which such disclosures must be made. Reviewing video footage to identify and authenticate the appropriate footage to be disclosed, and to redact facial images and other sensitive information prior to disclosure, have historically been time-consuming and largely manual processes. Today, law enforcement and other government agencies can leverage our aiWARE platform and applications to organize, review, analyze and gain insight from their various data sources to greatly enhance their investigative workflows and to support their public disclosure requirements. 
 Within the legal market, our AI technologies support eDiscovery, the process of identifying, collecting and producing electronically stored information, where audio and video content analysis is playing an increasingly important role in civil litigation and criminal proceedings. Our aiWARE platform’s applications and cognitive capabilities enable users to quickly search and analyze large volumes of audio files, video files, text-based documents and other electronically stored information to identify particular words, phrases, faces, objects and voices, and to redact sensitive information prior to production, greatly increasing the speed, reducing the cost, and improving the results of discovery processes.
 AI is also revolutionizing the way the world produces, transmits, and consumes energy. We have developed a suite of solutions that enable our GRI customers in the energy market, including utility companies, equipment providers, battery providers and independent energy aggregators, to optimize and synchronize the energy grid, using predictive AI to make clean energy more predictable, efficient, safe, reliable and cost effective. Our energy solutions power next generation smart grids by continuously collecting and synthesizing large amounts of data, empowering utilities to predict optimal energy supply mix and pricing to meet grid demand and ensure grid reliability and resiliency.

Illuminate’s text analytics capabilities allow users to visually explore entities, such as the persons, organizations and locations identified in the data. Once processed and reviewed through the application, users are able to transfer a relevant subset of media and documents to our Redact application if redaction is necessary or export it for transfer to their eDiscovery or case management platform for further processing and workflows. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Redact. Our Redact application enables law enforcement and judicial agencies to leverage AI to automate the redaction of faces and other sensitive information within audio, video and image-based evidence, significantly streamlining their redaction workflows. Redact employs AI technology to automatically detect when persons appear in evidence for review and selection. Users can also define other sensitive items appearing in video evidence and choose to automatically track the defined items for redaction throughout the video or at a single time stamp. The application then systematically obscures selected portions of the data in the evidence. With Redact, agencies can complete their review and redaction of evidence in a fraction of the amount of time spent on manual processes, freeing up valuable resources while also complying with stringent disclosure requirements.

Competition 
 Software Products & Services
 The market for AI-enabled solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with new AI capabilities and solutions introduced by both large established players that target multiple vertical markets or enterprise functions, as well as smaller emerging companies developing point solutions that generally only address a single cognitive category or a specific industry segment.  We believe the following competitive attributes are necessary for us to successfully compete in the AI industry for CE and GRI customers for our Software Products & Services: 

• | Applications to enable our platform to be effectively leveraged for a wide variety of use cases;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to seamlessly utilize multiple AI models in the same and different classes;

• | Ease of deployment and integration;
--+------------------------------------


• | Platform scalability, reliability and security; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Cost of deploying and using our products.
--+------------------------------------------

 7


We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We believe that few of our competitors currently compete directly with us across all of our cognitive capabilities and vertical markets, and that none of our competitors currently deploy an AI operating system with an open ecosystem comprised of a comparable number of multiple proprietary and third party AI models that can be accessed by customers from a single integrated platform. 
 Competitors for our Software Products & Services fall into the following primary categories: 
  
• | Infrastructure-based cloud computing vendors offering cognitive processing services via APIs, such as IBM Watson via IBM Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Services via Azure and Amazon Machine Learning via AWS;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smaller AI-focused vendors offering solutions within a single cognitive category such as facial recognition, object recognition, or natural language processing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise services and solutions providers that combine their services with technology developed in-house to address specific challenges for organizations, such as Palantir and C3.ai;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | System integrators that aggregate and integrate solutions from multiple underlying providers of cognitive services for clients, such as Accenture and Deloitte Consulting; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of hardware and/or software solutions serving a particular market, which are incorporating into their solutions automated processing, search and/or data analytics capabilities that provide functionality similar to our industry targeted applications, including the following:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the media and entertainment market, providers of digital asset management systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the public safety market, providers of police body cameras and car recorders and associated content storage and management systems; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the legal market, providers of eDiscovery solutions and/or associated hosting and managed services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managed Services
 Competitors of our Managed Services are mainly traditional advertising agencies that are either large full-service agencies or smaller niche agencies with a particular specialization or focus, such as radio media placement or podcast advertising, as well as large consulting firms in the media industry. We believe that we currently, and will continue to, compete successfully against our competitors on several key factors. We are a leader in endorsed radio and podcast advertising services, and we leverage our platform to provide our customers with innovative technology that we believe provides them with better analytics and insights into their advertising campaigns than our competitors for superior advertising performance and optimization. 
 We do not currently face significant competition from third parties for our content licensing Managed Services, particularly in North America; however, many content owners choose to manage the licensing of their content in-house, and content owners that we currently represent may choose to license their content directly in the future.  We believe that we may face more competition in North America if new content licensing companies emerge or expand their business in the region. As we expand our content licensing services to international markets, we believe that we may face greater competition from established content licensing and talent management companies.  We believe that our ability to use the cognitive capabilities of aiWARE to enrich and enhance the searchability of content, and to leverage relationships with existing customers and vendors across our Managed Services business, gives us a competitive advantage over other content licensing companies and allows us to achieve greater benefits for content owners than they can achieve through their own in-house efforts. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development organization is comprised of employees who are responsible for the design, development and testing of our AI and software solutions, including software engineers, quality engineers, data scientists, data engineers, product managers and user experience designers.  Our research and development organization is generally organized in teams, with one team focused on our core aiWARE architecture and capabilities and other teams focused on solutions and applications that address specific use cases in our key markets. We focus our efforts on developing new features and expanding the core technologies that further enhance the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of aiWARE, as well as allow us to operate in new vertical markets.  In addition, we contract with select third-party engineering services to support development and quality assurance testing.  We plan to continue to make significant investments in developing our AI technologies, expanding the functionality and capabilities of aiWARE and related solutions, and building new software capabilities.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. 
 As of March 9, 2022, in the United States, we had 32 issued patents, which expire between 2027 and 2040, and had 10 patent applications pending for examination. As of such date, we also had 12 issued patents and 29 patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions (including international PCT applications), all of which are based on counterpart U.S. patent applications pursued by us. In addition, we have registered, or have applied for registration of, numerous trademarks, including Veritone and aiWARE, in the United States and in several foreign jurisdictions.  We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection and other subjects. 
 Our customers utilize our products and services to process, analyze and store data, which may contain personal information that is subject to data protection and privacy laws in various jurisdictions including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and other states within the United States.   Under these data protection and privacy laws, we are required to maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and protection of personal data and information, and we must comply (either directly or indirectly in support of our customers’ compliance efforts, as provided for in our contracts with customers) with a number of requirements with respect to individuals whose personal data or information we collect and process, including, among others, notification requirements and requirements to comply with requests from individuals to (i) opt out of collection, processing and/or sale of their data or information, (ii) delete their data or information, and (iii) receive copies of and other information regarding our collection and processing of their data or information.
 The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will take effect on January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA to include additional obligations of businesses with respect to collecting, processing and sharing personal information and responding to requests from consumers related to their personal information.  We will be obligated to comply with the CPRA and the regulations to be implemented thereunder commencing in January 2023. 
 Human Capital Resources
 As of February 28, 2022, we had a total of 546 employees, substantially all of whom were full-time employees. 
 We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and our company culture is a critical component of our success.  We strive to create a work environment in which all employees feel a strong sense of community and embody our core values.  We have implemented a number of initiatives to ensure that our employees are engaged and motivated to work hard, and have fun at the same time.  We conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction, identify areas for improvement and implement positive change to evolve and better our company culture.
 We strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. To attract top talent, we strive to offer competitive salaries, incentives, equity compensation and benefits.  We conduct a regular quarterly talent review process, in which we obtain employee feedback, evaluate performance, and establish goals, objectives and development plans for all employees.  We continuously monitor and evaluate employee turnover to identify and address areas of concern to improve employee retention.
