ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Vivos Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on December 23, 1994 as Savage Mountain Sports Corporation (“SMSC”). On December 28, 2017, the Company changed its name from Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. to Vivos Inc. The Company has authorized capital of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.
 
Our principal place of business is 719 Jadwin Avenue, Richland, Washington 99352. Our telephone number is (509) 736-4000. Our corporate website address is http://www.radiogel.com. Our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol “RDGL.”
 
Overview
 
The Company is a radiation oncology medical device company engaged in the development of its yttrium-90 based brachytherapy device, RadioGel™, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company’s development efforts. The Company’s overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers and patients by providing them with new isotope technologies that offer safe and effective treatments for cancer.
 
The Company’s current focus is on the development of our RadioGel™ device candidate, including obtaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market and sell RadioGel™ as a Class II medical device. RadioGel™ is an injectable particle-gel for brachytherapy radiation treatment of cancerous tumors in people and animals. RadioGel™ is comprised of a hydrogel, or a substance that is liquid at room temperature and then gels when reaching body temperature after injection into a tumor. In the gel are small, one micron, yttrium-90 phosphate particles (“Y-90”). Once injected, these inert particles are locked in place inside the tumor by the gel, delivering a very high local radiation dose. The radiation is beta, consisting of high-speed electrons. These electrons only travel a short distance so the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Optimally, patients can go home immediately following treatment without the risk of radiation exposure to family members. Since Y-90 has a half-life of 2.7 days, the radioactively drops to 5% of its original value after ten days.
 
The Company’s lead brachytherapy products, including RadioGel™, incorporate patented technology developed for Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. Battelle has granted the Company an exclusive license to patents covering the manufacturing, processing and applications of RadioGel™ (the “Battelle License”). Other intellectual property protection includes proprietary production processes and trademark protection in 17 countries. The Company plans to continue efforts to develop new refinements on the production process, and the product and application hardware, as a basis for future patents.

The Company is currently focusing on obtaining approval from the FDA to market and sell RadioGel™ as a Class II medical device. The Company first requested FDA approval of RadioGel™ in June 2013, at which time the FDA classified RadioGel™ as a medical device. The Company then followed with a 510(k) submission which the FDA responded, in turn, with a request for a physician letter of substantial equivalence and a reformatted 510(k) summary, which the Company provided in January 2014. In February 2014, the FDA ruled the device as not substantially equivalent due to a lack of a predicate device and it was therefore classified as a Class III device. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory review, control and oversight. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed. Class II devices represent lower risk devices than Class III and require fewer regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. In contrast, Class I devices are deemed to be lower risk than Class II or III, and are therefore subject to the least regulatory controls.
 
The Company is currently developing test plans to address issues raised by the FDA in connection with the Company’s previous submissions regarding RadioGel™, including developing specific test plans and specific indication of use. The Company intends to request that the FDA grant approval to re-apply for de novo classification of RadioGel™, which would reclassify the device from a Class III device to a Class II device, further simplifying the path to FDA approval. In the event the FDA denies the Company’s application and subsequently determines during the de novo review that RadioGel™ cannot be classified as a Class I or Class I1 device, the Company will then need to submit a pre-market approval application to obtain the necessary regulatory approval as a Class III device. See also Business – Regulatory History for a discussion regarding the Company’s application for FDA approval of RadioGel™.
 
IsoPet Solutions
 
The Company’s, IsoPet Solutions division was established in May 2016 to focus on the veterinary oncology market, namely engagement of university veterinarian hospital to develop the detailed therapy procedures to treat animal tumors and ultimately use of the technology in private clinics. The Company has engaged four different university veterinarian hospitals to begin using RadioGel™ for treatment of four different cancer types in dogs and cats. Washington State University Veterinary Hospital has tested one cat to demonstrate the procedures and the absence of any significant toxicity effect. The other three centers are expected to begin therapy during the second quarter of 2017 after their internal administrative review process is completed.
 
These animal therapies will focus on creating labels that describe the procedures in detail as a guide to future veterinarians. The labels will be voluntarily submitted to the FDA for review. They will then be used as data for future FDA applications in the medical sector and as key intellectual property for licensing to private veterinary clinics.
 
The Company anticipates that future profit will be derived from direct sales of RadioGel™ and related services, and from licensing to private medical and veterinary clinics in the U.S. and internationally.
 
Regulatory History
 
RadioGel™ has a long regulatory history with the FDA. Initially, the Company submitted a presubmission (Q130140) to obtain FDA feedback about the proposed product. The FDA requested that the Company file a request for designation with the Office of Combination Products (RFD130051), which led to the determination that RadioGel™ is a device to be reviewed and regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The Company then submitted a 510(k) notice for RadioGel™ (K133368), which was found Not Substantially Equivalent due to the lack of a suitable predicate, and RadioGel™ was assigned to the Class III product code NAW (microspheres). Class III products or devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory review, control and oversight. Class III products or devices must typically be approved by FDA before they are marketed. Class II devices represent lower risk products or devices than Class III and require fewer regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the product’s or device’s safety and effectiveness. In contrast, Class I products and devices are deemed to be lower risk than Class I or II and are therefore subject to the least regulatory controls.

A presubmission meeting (Q140496) was held with the FDA on June 17, 2014, during which the FDA maintained that RadioGel™ should be considered a Class III device and therefore subject to pre-market approval. On December 29, 2014, the Company submitted a de novo petition for RadioGel™ (DEN140043). The de novo petition was denied by the FDA on June 1, 2015, with the FDA providing numerous comments and questions. On September 29, 2015, the Company submitted a follow-up pre-submission informational meeting request with the FDA (Q151569). At such meeting on November 9, 2015, the FDA indicated acceptance of the Company’s applied dosimetry methods and clarified the FDA’s outstanding questions regarding RadioGel™. The Company intends to prepare a new pre-submission to obtain FDA feedback on the proposed testing to address the concerns raised by the FDA staff, as well as the suitability of RadioGel™ for de novo reclassification.
 
In the event the FDA denies the Company’s application for de novo review, and therefore determines that RadioGel™ cannot be classified as a Class I or Class I1 device, the Company will then need to submit a pre-market approval application to obtain the necessary regulatory approval as a Class III device.
 
In previous FDA submittals, the Company proposed applying RadioGel™ for a very broad range of cancer therapies, referred to as Indication for Use. The FDA has requested that the Company reduce its Indications for Use. To comply with that request, the Company has expanded its Medical Advisory Board (“MAB”) and engaged doctors from respected hospitals who have evaluated the candidate cancer therapies based on three criteria: (1) potential for FDA approval and successful therapy; (2) notable advantage over current therapies; and (3) probability of wide spread acceptance by the medical community. 
 
The MAB selected eighteen applications for RadioGel™, each of which meet the criteria described above. This large number confirms the wide applicability of the device and defines the path for future business growth. The Company intends to apply to the FDA for a single Indication for Use, followed by subsequent applications for additional Indications for Use. The initial application should facilitate each subsequent application, and the testing for many of the subsequent applications could be conducted in parallel, depending on available resources.
 
The MAB selected the treatment of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers for the first Indication for Use to be submitted to the FDA. According to the American Cancer Society, one out of every three new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. is a cancerous skin lesion of this type, representing 5.5 million tumors diagnosed annually. The MAB believes RadioGel™ has the potential to be the preferred treatment in a reasonable number of cases in a very large market.
 
Financing and Strategy
 
Research and development of RadioGel™ and other products in the Company’s brachytherapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities as well as a series of grants. The Company requires funding of approximately $1.5 million annually to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 12 to 24 months, the Company believes it will cost approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million to fund: (1) the FDA approval process and initial deployment of RadioGel™ and other brachytherapy products, and (2) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. The continued deployment of RadioGel™ and the Company’s other brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel. The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12 to 24 months will be the FDA’s classification of the Company’s brachytherapy products, including RadioGel™, as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company’s spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company’s arrangements with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products’ success in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements or additional capital raises.

Following receipt of required regulatory approvals and financing in the U.S., the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing. Outside of the U.S., the Company intends to pursue licensing arrangements and/or partnerships to facilitate its global commercialization strategy.
 
In the longer-term, subject to the Company receiving adequate funding, regulatory approval for RadioGel™ and other brachytherapy products, and thereafter being able to successfully commercialize its brachytherapy products, the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect to other products and technologies intended to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses
 
Based on the Company’s financial history since inception, its auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to delay the implementation of its business strategy and may not be able to continue operations.
 
Product Features
 
The Company’s RadioGel™ device has the following product features:
 

● | Beta particles only travel a short distance so the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the nearby normal tissues. In medical terms Y-90 beta emitter has a high efficacy rate; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Benefitting from the short penetration distance, the patient can go home immediately with no fear of exposure to family members, and there is a greatly reduced radiation risk to the doctor. A simple plastic tube around the syringe, gloves and safety glasses are all that is required. Other gamma emitting products require much more protection; 
● | A 2.7-day half-life means that only 5% of the radiation remains after ten days. This is in contrast to the industry-standard gamma irradiation product, which has a half-life of 17 days; 
● | The short half-life also means that any medical waste can be stored for thirty days then disposed as normal hospital waste; 
● | RadioGel™ can be administered with small diameter needles (27-gauge) so there is minimal damage to the normal tissue. This is in contrast to the injection of metal seeds, which does considerable damage; and 
● | After about 120 days the gel resorbs by a normal biological cycle, called the Krebs Cycle. The only remaining evidence of the treatment are phosphate particles so small in diameter that it requires a high-resolution microscope to find them. This is in contrast to permanent presence of metal seeds. 

 
Steps from Production to Therapy
 
Device Production
 
During the next two years, the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing and distribution. As future product volume increases, the Company will reassess its make-buy decision on manufacturing and will analyze the cost/benefit of a centrally located facility.
 
Production of the Hydrogel
 
RadioGel™ is manufactured with a proprietary process under ventilated sterile hood by following strict Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, procedures. It is made in large batches that are frozen for up to three months. When the product is ready to ship, a small quantity of the gel is dissolved in a sterile saline solution. It is then passed through an ultra-fine filter to ensure sterility.

Production of the Yttrium-90 Phosphate Particles
 
The Y-90 particles are produced with simple ingredients via a proprietary process, again following strict GLP procedures. They are then mixed into a phosphate-buffered saline solution. They can be produced in large batches for several shipments. The number of particles per shipment is determined by the dose prescribed by the doctor.
 
Shipment
 
RadioGel™ is shipped in two containers, one with a solution of the gel and the other with a solution of the particles. Before shipment they are subjected to sterility testing, again by strict procedures. The vial with the Y-90 is put through a special radiation calibrator, which measures beta particles. The vials can be shipped via FedEx or UPS by following the proper protocols.
At the User
 
The user receives the two vials. The solution containing the RadioGel™ is mixed with the solution containing the Y-90 particles. This is then shaken to ensure homogeneity and withdrawn into a syringe. The quantities that are mixed are calculated from the information on the product label.
 


The specific injection technique depends on the Indication for Use. For small tumors, one centimeter in diameter or less, the cancer is treated with a single injection. For larger tumors, the cancer is treated with a series of small injections from the same syringe.
 


Principal Markets
 
The Company is currently pursuing two synergistic business sectors, medical and veterinary, each of which are summarized below.
 
Medical Sector
 
Brachytherapy is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area. According to the 2014 MEDraysintell report, the global market for brachytherapy reached US$ 680 million in 2013 and is projected to reach $2.4 billion by 2030. It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately half of the global market. The Company believes there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck cancers. The 2014 U.S. estimated new cases of cancer according to the American Cancer Society are 233,000 prostate, 235,030 breast, 31,190 liver, and 46,420 pancreas.
 
RadioGel™ is currently fully developed, requiring only FDA approval before commercialization. The Company has been seeking FDA approval of RadioGel™ for almost four years. The principal issue preventing approval is that the Company attempted to obtain regulatory approval for a broad range of Indications for Use, including all non-resectable cancers, without sufficient supporting data. 
 
Building on the FDA’s ruling of RadioGel™ as a device, the Company is currently developing test plans to address issues raised in the Company’s prior FDA submittal regarding RadioGel™. The Company intends to request FDA approval to submit RadioGel™ for de novo classification, which would reclassify the device from a Class III device to a Class II device, and accelerate the regulatory approval path.
 
After analyzing the Company’s data and the last four years of communication from the FDA, the Company has taken the following steps:
 

1. | Under new leadership, the Company is implementing all past recommendations from the FDA. The Company intends to narrow the Indications for Use, will provide test plans for FDA review to respond to answer all previous FDA questions, and will request a pre-submission meeting; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Prepare a pre-submission request document and FDA meeting request to obtain feedback on the test plans in order to initiate testing, to present the proposed content for the final application and to request permission to submit a de novo; 


- 5 -
-----


3. | Submit an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to obtain permission to conduct human clinical studies; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. | File a de novo or Pre-Market Approval application. 

 
The critical path is the required testing – in vitro, animal testing, human clinical studies – all of which is resource dependent.
 
In previous submittals, the Company proposed applying a very broad range of cancer therapies, referred to as Indications for Use, to RadioGel™. The FDA has strongly advised the Company to reduce its Indications for Use. To comply with that request, the Company has expanded its MAB, consisting of Drs. Barry D. Pressman (Chairman), Albert DeNittis, Howard Sandler, and Darrell Fisher.
 
The MAB evaluated the candidate cancer therapies based on three criteria: (i) the potential for FDA approval and successful therapy; (ii) notable advantages of RadioGel™ over current therapies; and (iii) the likelihood that RadioGel™ can be widely accepted by the medical community and profitably commercialized.
 
The MAB selected eighteen Indications for Use for RadioGel™, each of which meets the above-mentioned criteria. These eighteen Indications for Use are listed below. This large number confirms the wide applicability of the device and defines the path for future growth. The Company intends to apply to the FDA for a single Indication for Use, followed by subsequent applications for additional Indications for Use. The initial application should facilitate each subsequent application, and the testing for many of the subsequent applications could be conducted in parallel, depending on available resources.
 

● Skin cancer ● Involved lymph nodes ● Bladder ● Liver ● Localized prostate ● Pancreas ● Head and neck (including sino-nasal and oropharyngeal) ● Ocular melanoma | ● Non-dendritic brain ● Pediatric cancers – several types ● Rectal ● Gynecological ● Spinal ● Recurrent esophageal ● Breast cancer resection cavity ● Anaplastic thyroid 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
After thorough review to prioritize indications, the MAB has selected basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancers) as the first Indication for Use to be presented to the FDA. According to American Cancer Society, one out of every three new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. is a cancerous skin lesion of this type, representing 5.5 million tumors annually. The MAB believes RadioGel™ will be the preferred treatment in a reasonable number of cases in a very large market.
 
Veterinary Sector
 
There are about 150 million pet dogs and cats in the United States. Nearly one-half of dogs and one-third of cats are diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. The Veterinary Oncology & Hermatology Center in Norwalk, Connecticut, reports that cancer is the number one natural cause of death in older cats and dogs, accounting for nearly 50 percent of pet deaths each year. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports that half of the dogs ten years or older will die because of cancer. The National Cancer Institute reports that about six million dogs are diagnosed with cancer each year, translating to more than 16,000 a day. The average cost of treating tumors in dogs using radiation is $5,000 to 7,000, according to petcarerx.com.
 
The Company’s IsoPet operating division focuses on the veterinary oncology market. Dr. Alice Villalobos, a founding member of the Veterinary Cancer Society and the Chair of our Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board, has been providing guidance to management regarding this market. The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board gives us recommendations regarding the overall strategy for our animal business sector. Specifically, they recommended the university veterinary hospitals for demonstration therapies, the specific cancers to be treated, and have provided business contact information to the private clinics.

Since the FDA has classified RadioGel™ as a device, the Company can implement future improvements in the product and the application techniques to further benefit animals and to strengthen our intellectual property, without any further FDA approvals.
 
The Company currently intends to utilize university veterinary hospitals for therapy development, given that veterinary hospitals offer superior and plentiful veterinarians and students, a large number of animal patients, radioactive material handling licenses, and are respected by private veterinary centers and hospitals.
 
The Company has recently engaged four different university veterinarian hospitals to begin using RadioGel™ for four different cancer types in dogs and cats. Each veterinary hospital will focus on a different cancer therapy:
 

● | Washington State University – feline sarcoma, possibly followed by canine sarcoma; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | University of Missouri – soft tissue carcinoma, possibly followed by localized prostate; 
● | University of Florida – lymph nodes, followed by liver cancer; and 
● | Colorado State University – oral squamous cancer. 



Washington State University Veterinary Hospital has tested one cat to demonstrate the procedures and the absence of any significant toxicity effect. The others typically take about two months to complete their internal review before they can begin therapy. In each case, they will treat several animals with the objective of creating a detailed therapy procedure, which will be incorporated into product information for RadioGel™, known as a Label. The Company will then voluntarily ask the FDA to review this Label, as suggested by their guidance. These Labels will be used as part of our medical application to the FDA. A number of these animal cancers also occur in humans, so there is a direct benefit to our FDA applications when we get to that particular Indication for Use. The Labels and the animal experience will also be used to transfer the therapies to the private clinics and hospitals. 
 
After completing the first set of therapies, each university veterinary hospital will select additional Indications for Use.
 
The engagement with each university hospital includes: (i) an agreement of interest; (ii) the creation of detailed protocols defining the specific cancers to be treated and the recommended therapy procedures; (iii) submittal of the protocols to the internal independent review committee that addresses safety and animal welfare; and (iv) the execution of a formal contact. Washington State University has completed all four steps and is treating cats for feline sarcoma. The remaining university hospitals are in combined steps (ii) and (iii).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the contract with Washington State University, it will be responsible for conducting studies regarding studies regarding in vivo dosimetry and toxicity of intralesional Y-90 phosphate nanoparticles for the treatment of spontaneous canine sarcomas and equine sarcoids. The term of the contract is October 1, 2016 through February 1, 2018. The Company provides the university with the RadioGel required to complete the studies, as well as technical support for dosimetry calculations. All payments provided to Washington State University in relation to the contract shall be made by Washington State Life Sciences Discovery Fund pursuant to a grant, and shall not be paid by the Company.

Competitors
 
The Company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation, extensive research efforts, and significant competition.
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes. A number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that our products target. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of potentially competitive products or their possible effect on our sales. Certain potentially competitive products to our products are possibly in various stages of development. Also, there may be many ongoing studies with currently marketed products and other developmental products, which may yield new data that could adversely impact the use of our products in their current and potential future Indications for Use. The introduction of competitive products could significantly reduce our sales, which, in turn would adversely impact our financial and operating results.
 
There are a wide variety of cancer treatments approved and marketed in the U.S. and globally. General categories of treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. These products have a diverse set of success rates and side effects. The Company’s products, including RadioGel™, fall into the brachytherapy treatment category. There are a number of brachytherapy devices currently marketed in the U.S. and globally. The traditional iodine-125 (I-125) and palladium-103 (Pd-103) technologies for brachytherapy are well entrenched with powerful market players controlling the market. The industry-standard I-125-based therapy was developed by Oncura, which is a unit of General Electric Company. Additionally, C.R. Bard, a major industry player competes in the I-125 brachytherapy marketplace. These market competitors are also involved in the distribution of Pd-103 based products. Cs-131 brachytherapy products are sold by IsoRay. Several Y-90 therapies have been FDA approved including SIR-Spheres by Sirtex, TheraSphere by Biocompatibles UK and Zevalin by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.
 
Raw Materials
 
The Company currently subcontracts the manufacturing of RadioGel™ at IsoTherapeutics. Perkin Elmer Inc., the only supplier of Y-90 in the United States, is the sole supplier of the Y-90 used by IsoTherapeutics to manufacture the Company’s RadioGel™. The Company obtains supplies, hardware, handling equipment and packaging from several different U.S. suppliers.
Customers
 
The Company anticipates that potential customers for our potential brachytherapy products likely would include those institutions and individuals that currently purchase brachytherapy products or other oncology treatment products.
Government Regulation
 
The Company’s present and future intended activities in the development, manufacturing and sale of cancer therapy products, including RadioGel™, are subject to extensive laws, regulations, regulatory approvals and guidelines. Within the United States, the Company’s therapeutic radiological devices must comply with the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by FDA. The Company is also required to adhere to applicable FDA Quality System Regulations, also known as the Good Manufacturing Practices, which include extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates, among other things, new product clearances and approvals to establish the safety and efficacy of these products. We are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act.
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, distribution, use, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil penalties, recall, injunction or seizure of products, refusal of the government to approve or clear product approval applications, disqualification from sponsoring or conducting clinical investigations, preventing us from entering into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications, and criminal prosecution.

In the United States, medical devices are classified into three different categories over which the FDA applies increasing levels of regulation: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification 510(k); most Class II devices require premarket notification 510(k); and most Class III devices require premarket approval. RadioGel™ is currently classified as a Class III device.
 
Approval of new Class III medical devices is a lengthy procedure and can take a number of years and require the expenditure of significant resources. There is a shorter FDA review and clearance process for Class II medical devices, the premarket notification or 510(k) process, whereby a company can market certain Class II medical devices that can be shown to be substantially equivalent to other legally marketed devices.
 
The Company intends to apply for a de novo with an anticipated expenditure of $4.0 million over the next four years. This expenditure estimate includes anticipated costs associated with in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical testing, our application for an Investigational Device Exemption, Phase I and Phase II clinical trials and our application for a de novo.
 
As a registered medical device manufacturer with the FDA, we are subject to inspection to ensure compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. These regulations require that we and any of our contract manufacturers design, manufacture and service products, and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, distribution, storage, design control, and service activities. Modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of a device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device require a new 510(k) premarket notification for any significant product modification.
 
The Medical Device Reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to be associated with the use of our devices, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are regulated by the FDA and, in some circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission.
 
As a medical device manufacturer, we are also subject to laws and regulations administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels. For example, our facility is licensed as a medical device manufacturing facility in the State of Washington and is subject to periodic state regulatory inspections. Our customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.
 
In the United States, as a manufacturer of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material, we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the FDA and FAA, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Washington State Department of Health, to ensure such devices are safe and effective. In Washington State, the Department of Health, by agreement with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. RadioGel™ constitutes both medical devices and radioactive sealed sources and are subject to these regulations.
 
Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Our business does not require us to comply with any extraordinary environmental regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had three full-time personnel. The Company utilizes several independent contractors to assist with its operations. The Company does not have a collective bargaining agreement with any of its personnel, and believes its relations with its personnel are good.
