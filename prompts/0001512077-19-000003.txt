ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading provider of media and satellite-based connectivity to fast-growing, global enterprise, consumer and government markets across air, land and sea. Supported by proprietary and best-in-class technologies, we entertain, inform and connect travelers and crew with our integrated suite of rich media content and seamless connectivity solutions capable of covering the globe. We are focused on delivering exceptional service and rapid support to a diverse base of customers around the world. As of December 31, 2018, our business comprises two operating segments: Connectivity and Media & Content. See Note 15. Segment Information for a further discussion of our reportable segments.
 Connectivity. Our Connectivity segment provides satellite-based connectivity services to enterprise and government customers in the aviation, maritime and land vertical markets. We provide:

• | Wi-Fi connectivity (utilizing specialized network equipment and technology) that enables access to the Internet, live television, messaging services, e-commerce, games, on-demand content and travel-related information; and


• | Connectivity-enabled solutions for advertising, operational performance management and analytics that enable our customers to increase profitability through generation of new revenue streams and more efficient operations.

Our Connectivity segment generates revenue primarily through the sale of Internet access, data, video, client-server applications, television services, advertising, operations solutions, sponsorships and other related services and network backhaul services, as well as equipment to support these services.
Media & Content. Our Media & Content segment buys, produces, manages and distributes wholly-owned and licensed media content, video and music programming, advertising, applications and video games, and provides post-production services, for and to customers in the airline, maritime and other “away-from-home” non-theatrical markets (also known as “mobility markets”). Our Media & Content segment generates revenue primarily through the licensing and management of owned and licensed media content, video and music programming, applications and video games to the mobility markets. Secondarily, our Media & Content segment generates revenue from providing value-added services such as selection, purchase, production, customer support, software development, creative services and technical editing and curating of media content in connection with the integration and servicing of entertainment programs as well as the sourcing of advertising from agencies and directly from brands for use in those markets.

Operating Segments
Connectivity
Our Connectivity segment provides our customers with satellite-based Internet access and streaming and broadcast live television, on-demand content, texting services, games, e-commerce, travel-related information and backhaul solutions. We provide our customers and their passengers, crew and personnel with operational solutions and Wi-Fi connectivity primarily via C-band, Ka-band, Ku-band and Ku-band High Throughput Satellites (“Ku HTS”) satellite transmissions. We obtain satellite coverage through various global satellite services providers, including Hughes Network Systems, LLC (“Hughes”), New Skies Satellites B.V. (“SES”), an affiliate of SES S.A., and Intelsat Corporation (“Intelsat”). Global Eagle operates a vertically integrated teleport and ground network infrastructure that integrates leased satellite capacity from multiple satellite operators. We utilize proprietary performance-enhancing technologies to increase the efficiency of our network with patented technology that increases end-user quality of experience. 
Our Connectivity segment connects aircraft, vessels and fixed ground stations to orbiting satellites which link data to ground earth stations. Our ground earth stations are connected by a terrestrial broadband network with fully-meshed Multiprotocol Label Switching (“MPLS”). Global Eagle develops, integrates and sells, leases and/or provides a right to use proprietary third-party manufactured antenna systems (including at times as part of an equipment and services bundle) for connectivity customers. 
Global Eagle pioneered the application of satellite-based connectivity in large airline fleets. Our aircraft Wi-Fi connectivity system was first deployed by a commercial airline in 2009, and our in-flight broadband services became fully operational in 2010. Following the completion of our licensed and operational in-flight broadband system in 2010, we commenced installation of our connectivity system equipment on Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest Airlines”) aircraft and began to generate revenue. As of December 31, 2018, Global Eagle provided Internet connectivity and Wi-Fi-enabled entertainment services on 1,022 aircraft. 
To expand into the maritime and land connectivity markets, Global Eagle acquired Emerging Markets Communication (“EMC”) in July 2016 (the “EMC Acquisition”). EMC was a communications services provider that delivered communications, Internet, live television, on-demand video, voice, and network backhaul services to land-based sites and marine vessels globally, and whose offerings have now been integrated into Global Eagle. Following the EMC Acquisition, EMC comprised our third operating segment, called Maritime & Land Connectivity, which we combined with our former Aviation Connectivity segment in the second quarter of 2017, to form our current reporting structure. For purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, however, we continue to have three separate reporting units: Aviation Connectivity, Maritime & Land Connectivity and Media & Content. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $64.0 million charge related to the impairment of goodwill in the Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit. This was as a result of reduced financial projections for the Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit, due to, among other things: lower than expected actual financial results from this reporting unit due to margin compression resulting from competition in our cellular backhaul business in Africa, which resulted in diminished financial performance relative to our original expectations; delayed new deal executions and slower than anticipated installations and upgrades, which also resulted in diminished financial performance relative to our original expectations; and operational challenges in integrating a legacy EMC acquiree into this reporting unit, which resulted in delayed acquisition synergies. Given the foregoing, we determined there was greater uncertainty in achieving our prior financial projections and so we applied a higher discount rate for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis. The higher discount rate reduced the fair value of the Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we identified a triggering event (i.e., an event that requires us to perform an impairment analysis) due to a significant decline in our market capitalization. Accordingly, we assessed the fair value of our three reporting units as of March 31, 2017 and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $78.0 million related to our Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit. This impairment was primarily due to lower than expected financial results of this reporting unit during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to delays in new maritime installations, slower than originally estimated execution of EMC Acquisition-related synergies and other events (e.g., significant management turnover) that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Given these indicators, we determined, at that time, that there was a higher degree of uncertainty in achieving our financial projections for this reporting unit and as such, increased its discount rate, which reduced the fair value of the unit. 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we again identified a triggering event due to a further decline in our market capitalization, which we believe was driven by investor uncertainty around our liquidity position and the previous delinquency of our SEC filings. Consequently, we performed another assessment of the fair value of our three reporting units for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. In performing that reassessment, we adjusted the assumptions used in the impairment analysis and increased the discount rate used in the impairment model, which negatively impacted the fair value of the Maritime & Land Connectivity and Aviation Connectivity reporting units. Following this analysis, we determined that the fair value of the Media & Content 
5

reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, while the fair value of the Maritime & Land Connectivity and Aviation Connectivity reporting units were below their carrying values. As such, we recorded impairment charges of $45.0 million and $44.0 million in our Maritime & Land Connectivity and Aviation Connectivity reporting units, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2017. The key assumptions underlying our valuation model used for accounting purposes, as described above, were updated to reflect the delays in realizing anticipated EMC-Acquisition related synergies that impact both the Maritime & Land Connectivity and Aviation Connectivity reporting units. Additionally, network expansion to meet current and anticipated new customer demand caused a step-up in bandwidth costs in our Maritime & Land and Aviation Connectivity reporting units. Our total goodwill impairment recorded for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $167.0 million. No impairment was identified or recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, in accordance with ASC 323, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, we completed an assessment of the recoverability of our equity method investments. We determined that the fair value of our investment in Santander Teleport S.L. (“Santander”) exceeded the carrying value; however, the carrying value of our interest in the Wireless Maritime Services, LLC (“WMS”) joint venture exceeded the estimated fair value of our interest, which management concluded was other than temporary, and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of $16.7 million relating to our WMS equity investment, which is in addition to the Connectivity impairment that we discussed in the foregoing paragraph. This WMS impairment was primarily the result of lower than expected financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the loss of a roaming partner. This resulted in a decline in revenue and margin which we are not expected to recover in the foreseeable future, causing us to reduce our financial projections for the WMS business for 2018 and beyond.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, in accordance with ASC 323, we completed an assessment of the recoverability of our equity method investments. We determined that the fair value of our investment in Santander exceeded the carrying value; however, the carrying value of our investment in our WMS joint venture exceeded the estimated fair value of our investment, which management concluded was other than temporary, and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of $51 million relating to our WMS equity investment. This WMS impairment was primarily the result of slower than expected adoption of growth initiatives, reducing our financial projections for the WMS business for 2019 and beyond.
See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of our goodwill impairment.

Customers
We provide our Connectivity services worldwide to the aviation, maritime and land markets, with customers located in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, our largest Connectivity customer was Southwest Airlines, which represented approximately 18%, 19% and 22% of our total consolidated revenue, respectively. The declining proportion of Southwest Airlines as a percentage of consolidated revenue is as a result of the broadening of our revenue and customer base. 
We provide content-curating, management and processing services to the airline, maritime, and non-theatrical industries globally. Our customers also include major Hollywood and international studios.
Other than Southwest Airlines, no other single customer in our Connectivity or Media & Content segment constituted more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue in 2018.
Competitive Advantages
Connectivity
Our satellite-based broadband services allow us to connect our customers to the Internet and deliver live-streaming television, on-demand content, texting services, shopping and other related services over land and sea. Our satellite Wi-Fi platform is capable of being operated gate-to-gate (where government regulations permit) and over the majority of the commonly used air and maritime routes across the globe at the data throughput levels required to deliver a feature-rich IFE experience. We also have relationships with Hughes, SES and Intelsat, among others, and have network operational footprints worldwide. As a result, we believe one of our competitive advantages is our ability to rapidly on-board and service new and existing airline, maritime and land-based customers regardless of where they operate.
In addition to regional expansion, we have the ability to rapidly expand our product offerings worldwide. We launched our live television and texting services to customers in the United States and now offer similar and other related services in additional markets around the world. We target heavily air-trafficked regions, which allows us to leverage existing and add additional customers with little interruption to our base operations. Adding customers in areas with existing satellite coverage (utilized for launch customers) enables us to spread fixed costs associated with transponders over a larger network base.
We have dedicated engineering resources for our connectivity services, enabling us to deploy end-to-end solutions for our customers. For example, our engineering resources assist our airline customers with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, 
10

such as STCs, which permit our equipment to be installed and operated on the applicable aircraft type covered by the STC (regardless of airline operator). As we continue to obtain STCs on a wider variety of plane types, we will be able to leverage these STCs for more rapid deployment on new airline customers in the future on a more cost-effective and efficient basis.
Our Network Operations Centers (“NOCs”) are based in the United States (Illinois and Florida), South America (Sao Paolo, Brazil), Europe (Santander, Spain) and the Middle East (Sharjah, UAE). The NOCs manage our 24/7 satellite and network operations and monitor each plane and vessel whether in operation on the ground or docked. We recently expanded our NOCs facilities to manage our growing fleet of connected aircraft and vessels and to continue driving new innovations for our IFC system and offerings.
Media & Content
We develop, acquire and distribute video content, games and other media content and work closely with major and independent studios and other content producers. Accordingly, our significant operating and deal-making experience and relationships with companies in these industries gives us a number of competitive advantages and may present us with additional business targets and relationships to facilitate growth going forward. We believe that we have sustainable competitive advantages due to our market positions, technology and relationships with important content suppliers and airlines. In addition, our global talent and expertise provides the nuanced insight needed to make content suitable for regional, cultural, and religious requirements of our customers. 
We are a market leader in providing content and services to the airline, maritime and other “away from home” non-theatrical markets around the world. Our cultural expertise allows us to provide customized solutions to accommodate cultural and linguistic requirements in all key markets, across industries. We provide our content services to many airlines in markets such as the Middle East, Asia and Europe, where demand for content tends to be stronger and airlines are more widely equipped with on-board IFE solutions than in the United States. We also provide solutions for advanced, interactive IFE hardware systems. The new IFE hardware systems provide the technological basis for turning the systems previously used only for the purpose of entertaining passengers into interactive passenger platforms that offer a variety of possibilities. In the IFE industry, this strategic development entails changing IFE into a complete “passenger experience.” We intend to continue to leverage our market position and technological know-how to participate in and take advantage of this cutting-edge development in IFE for the benefit of our customers and their passengers.
With our ability to offer a wide variety of content, games and related services, we believe that we provide our customers with more content options and more cost-effective content solutions than our competitors. 
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that our combined connectivity and media and content services enhance and personalize the experience our customers deliver to their travelers. Using portals created specifically for the mobility audience, we provide Internet access, content-on-demand, and live television programming. Connectivity enhances our content capabilities by expanding our vertical markets across the mobility markets and introducing new capacity for personalized end-user advertising. Providing rich content directly to passengers’ own devices creates new opportunities for revenue from passengers and brand sponsorship. Content enhances our connectivity capabilities by differentiating our products, increasing traffic on our connectivity system, and providing licensing for television and live events. Our services are uniquely positioned to change the existing mobility model and drive towards a satellite-connected entertainment and commerce platform. 
Connectivity
We are seeking to aggressively expand our Connectivity solutions to customers worldwide. In aviation markets, we already have significant operations in North America, Europe and the Middle East. We have initiated operations in South America and Asia, and we strategically target new opportunities in markets with high populations and traffic density, such as Asia Pacific, China, India and Brazil, as well as major airlines in North America and Western Europe. In maritime and land markets, we are focused on winning large fleets and fixed terrestrial installations with a combination of efficient broadband capacity and integrated content that improves traveler experience, crew welfare and revenue generation for our customers.
Leverage Technology
We believe we have the most technologically advanced ground network and performance-enhancing technologies in the market today, and we plan to leverage our network strength as we incorporate the newest technology from our satellite partners. In aviation markets, our technology has proven reliability, global certifications and market-leading capabilities for performance on geostationary satellite networks at mid- and high-latitudes. In maritime and land markets, we have unique multi-band capabilities, 
11

patented technologies that improve the quality of experience for end-users and a global network backbone that we believe differentiates us from our competitors. We plan to leverage these advantages as we target expansion in new and emerging markets. 
Continue Technological Evolution

We work continuously to improve existing systems and user interfaces, while also developing plans to remain at the forefront of the technological curve. We recently introduced our next-generation three-axis Ku-band antenna system for aviation, and we expect to introduce our next-generation Ka-band antenna system in commercial service in the near future. We also expect to continue to develop better-performing components of our system, including new aviation components to better service long-haul carriers and new maritime components for television and premium media distribution. Our strategic decision to develop key components and systems that interface with handheld devices should enable our aviation, maritime and land customers to stay on the cutting edge of technological advancements.
Media & Content
Supply-Chain Efficiency
Given our strong position in the IFE content market, we are able to manage large customer budgets, as well as provide a fully outsourced IFE solution to our customers. We believe that this quality and scale will lead to longer-term contracts and a wider variety of services as evidenced by winning multiple new contracts with terms longer than five years and covering creative user interfaces and innovation as well as traditional content. The scale we have in our post-production facilities and range in content rights management allows for a more efficient cost structure and enables us to serve newer, smaller and more remote customers.
Increasing the Value of Traditional Content
One of our strengths is our ability to efficiently scale our post-production facilities and provide a range of content rights management to our customers. We believe that this will lead to expanded services with existing customers and allow us to more rapidly expand our services to newer, smaller and more remote customers. 
Competition
Our Connectivity segment operates in a highly competitive environment, but we are able to combine network scale across aviation, maritime and land with a global satellite and ground network system, performance-enhancing technologies, end-to-end service management including installation and repair, and fully integrated content and media services. 
In aviation, our primary in-flight connectivity competitors are Gogo, Inc., ViaSat, Inc., Thales Avionics Inc., Inmarsat plc and Panasonic Avionics Corporation. In maritime and land, our primary competitors are Speedcast, Inmarsat plc, Marlink and O3b Networks Ltd. Our competitors use different technologies, including air-to-ground mobile services and satellite connectivity on C-band, Ku-band, Ka-band and L-band networks to provide connectivity to customers. We believe our satellite services offer a competitive combination of worldwide availability, quality of experience, available high-speed bandwidth and cost compared to our competitors.
We believe our Media & Content segment services the majority of the content-services market for the worldwide airline industry. We have different competitors for our various activities in the content market. For airline content curation and post-production and advertising, we primarily compete with Spafax, which is affiliated with the advertising and public-relations company WPP PLC. In the maritime content curation market, our primary competitor is Swank Motion Pictures Inc. We primarily compete against two companies, Envee Soft and Ensemble Media, for applications and games on seat-back systems and against numerous companies that provide applications and games for consumer mobile devices. 
We believe our state-of-the-art studio services offer unparalleled solutions to our mobility and studio partners compared to our Media & Content competitors. In addition, we believe that our worldwide relationships with major airline carriers and Hollywood studios provide us with a significant competitive advantage over our competition. For software and applications, we have built up processes for certification on all the major proprietary entertainment systems that make up the bulk of airline entertainment systems.

As a participant in the global airline and global telecommunication industries we are subject to a variety of government regulatory obligations.

Federal Aviation Administration/European Aviation Safety Agency
Our aviation and maritime and land connectivity services require the installation of network hardware on aircraft and maritime vessels and in remote land locations. The installation of equipment on aircraft is subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the FAA and its global counterparts, including the EASA. Prior to installing our equipment on an aircraft type, we are required to obtain an STC, which supplements the original Type Certificate obtained by the original aircraft manufacturer from the FAA/EASA and identifies the parts to be installed and the location of the installation and will only be issued by the FAA/EASA after we comply with the airworthiness standards applicable to the installation of hardware such as ours (for example, bird strike regulation compliance). To date, we have obtained STCs for installing our connectivity solution hardware on the Boeing 737 Next Generation series of aircraft, the Boeing 757, 767 and 777 aircraft families, and the Airbus A320 aircraft family. We are also a Boeing linefit supplier for the Boeing 737 Next Generation and 737 MAX aircraft families. We currently have additional STC projects underway. 
Global Aviation Connectivity Services Regulation
In connection with our in-flight connectivity services, we are required to obtain permission to operate in each jurisdiction over which we provide services using satellite Earth Stations Aboard Aircraft (“ESAA”), also referred to globally as “ESIMs,” or Earth Stations in Motion. In the United States, we have a blanket license from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) that allows us to provide ESAA services as an application of the Fixed-Satellite Service subject to compliance with various technical and operational requirements imposed by the FCC. Certain other countries also require affirmative licenses; however, many countries only require a notification of intent to provide services and certain technical details, without requiring affirmative regulatory approval. To date, we are permitted to provide our aviation connectivity services in approximately 150 countries. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a workforce of 1,517 employees, of which 1,322 were full-time employees and the remainder temporary labor and contractors. Of the full-time employees, approximately 44% were employed in the United States. Our Brazilian employees are unionized and are employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. Such collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated annually on May 1, generally to account for inflation. Approximately 2% of our overall workforce is employed in Brazil. 
Other than our employees in Brazil, none of our employees are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
On February 22, 2019, we announced our intention to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15%, as part of our operating expense savings initiative. The changes to our workforce will vary by country.
Corporate History
We were formed in February 2011 as a “special purpose acquisition company” whose purpose was to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or similar business combination with one or more businesses. In January 2013, we completed a business combination transaction and changed our name to Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. We acquired multiple other companies and assets through M&A activities subsequent to 2013, and in July 2016, we acquired EMC to expand our maritime and land connectivity markets. Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Center Drive Suite 1020, Los Angeles, California, 90045.
