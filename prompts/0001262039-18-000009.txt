ITEM 1.    Business 
Overview
Fortinet is a global leader in broad, automated and integrated cybersecurity solutions. We provide high performance cybersecurity solutions to a wide variety of businesses, such as carriers, data centers, enterprises and distributed offices, including a majority of the Fortune 100 companies. Our cybersecurity solutions are designed to provide broad, automated and integrated protection against dynamic and sophisticated security threats, while simplifying the information technology (“IT”) and security infrastructure of our end-customers. 
We have four current focus areas for our business. 

• | Core Business (FortiGate)—We derive a majority of product sales from our FortiGate appliances. Our FortiGate appliances include the FortiGate-20 to -100 series, designed for small businesses and enterprises with distributed offices (“low-end products”), the FortiGate-200 to -900 series for medium-sized businesses (“mid-range products”) and the FortiGate-1000 to -7000 series for large businesses and service providers (“high-end products”). In February 2018, we launched the new FortiGate 6000 series, which is built upon a new hardware process and architecture that delivers over 100 gigabytes of advanced threat protection and secure sockets layer (“SSL”) inspection to handle the volume of traffic driven by increased adoption of the cloud.

Our FortiOS operating system provides the foundation for all FortiGate security functions and offers end-customers the ability to manage security capabilities across their cloud assets and software-defined wireless area networks. Our network security platform also includes our FortiGuard security subscription services, which end-customers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to updates to application control, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, web filtering and anti-spam functionality. End-customers may also purchase FortiCare technical support services for our products and FortiCare professional services to assist in the design, implementation and maintenance of their networks. We complement our core FortiGate product line with other products and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the business. 

• | Fortinet Security Fabric—We developed the Fortinet Security Fabric to provide unified security across the entire digital attack surface, including network core, endpoints, applications, data centers, access and private and public cloud. The Fortinet Security Fabric is designed to enable traditionally disparate security devices to work together as an integrated and collaborative whole. It delivers integrated scalability, access control, awareness, security, traffic segmentation, centralized management, visibility and orchestration. The breadth of the Fortinet Security Fabric helps businesses and government agencies defend the expanding attack surface.

At the core of the Fortinet Security Fabric are our FortiGate hardware products and software, which include a broad set of security services, including firewall, virtual private network, anti-malware, anti-spam, application control, intrusion prevention, access control, web filtering, traffic and device segmentation and advanced threat protection (“ATP”). Through these security services, our FortiGuard Labs team provides updates using threat research and a global cloud network of data collection and intelligence resources to deliver subscription-based security services to FortiGate appliances and software products. 
We continue to expand the adoption of the Fortinet Security Fabric to third-party solution providers. In 2017, we welcomed 18 new partners to our Fabric-Ready partner program, including Intel, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. Our Fabric-ready program consisted of 37 ecosystem partners as of February 3, 2018. Billings for non-FortiGate products and services increased in 2017. 

• | Fortinet Cloud Security—Our technology positions us to deliver security to the cloud and for the cloud. We help our customers secure their cloud implementations by offering integration, visibility and automation across multi-cloud and hybrid deployments. We have a variety of software products designed to extend traditional network security protection into the cloud as standalone solutions, or as part of our distributed Security Fabric architecture. Our FortiCASB extends the core capabilities of our security fabric architecture to provide businesses the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence in cloud environments as they do on their physical networks. The Fortinet cloud security is available across all major cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud.

• | Internet of Things (“IoT”) and Operational Technology Security (“OT”)—The emergence of the IoT has created an environment where data moves freely between devices across locations, network environments, remote offices, mobile workers and public cloud environments, making it difficult to consistently track and secure. We are continuing to extend broad security to these IoT and OT environments. Our products enable critical infrastructure and industrial organizations to deliver advanced segmentation, access control and malware protection needed to unify their security architecture and defend their OT networks regardless of the operating environment.

During our year ended December 31, 2017, we generated total revenue of $1.49 billion and net income of $31.4 million. See Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
We were incorporated in Delaware in November 2000. Our principal executive office is located at 899 Kifer Road, 
Sunnyvale, California 94086 and our telephone number at that location is (408) 235-7700. 
Technology and Architecture
Our proprietary SPU hardware architecture, FortiOS operating system and associated security and networking functions combine to form the Fortinet Security Fabric. This approach to security ties together discrete security solutions into an integrated whole, which enables our products to perform security processing for networks with high throughput requirements across a broad threat landscape.
SPU
Our proprietary SPU consists of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”) consisting of three main lines of processors: (i) the Content Processor (“SPU CP”), (ii) the Network Processor (“SPU NP”) and (iii) the System-on-a-Chip (“SPU SOC”). Our proprietary ASICs are designed to enhance the security processing capabilities implemented in software by accelerating computationally intensive tasks such as firewall policy enforcement, network address translation, IPS threat detection and encryption. This architecture provides the flexibility of implementing accelerated processing of new threat detection without requiring a new ASIC. The SPU CP is currently included in most of our entry-level and all of our mid-range and high-end FortiGate appliances. The SPU NP is currently included in some of our mid-range and high-end FortiGate appliances, delivering additional accelerated firewall and VPN performance. Entry-level FortiGate products often use the SPU SOC2 or SPU SOC3 to provide the necessary acceleration at this level. Mid-range FortiGate products use a central processing unit (“CPU”) and include the SPU NP and SPU CP hardware acceleration. The high-end FortiGate products use multiple CPUs, SPU CPs and SPU NPs.

FortiOS
Our proprietary FortiOS operating system provides the foundation for the operation of all FortiGate appliances, whether physical, virtual, private or public cloud or on-demand based, and is at the heart of our Security Fabric implementation. The core kernel functions to the security processing feature sets work together to provide a highly integrated solution. FortiOS provides (i) multiple layers of security, including a hardened kernel layer providing protection for the FortiGate system, (ii) a network security layer providing security for end-customers’ network infrastructures and (iii) application content protection providing security for end-customers’ workstations and applications. FortiOS directs the operations of processors and SPUs and provides system management functions such as command-line, graphical user interfaces, multiple network and security topology views.

Key high-level functions and capabilities of FortiOS include:

• | key enablement for the Fortinet Security Fabric architecture;


• | allowing for FortiGate appliances to be configured into different security environments such as our Internal Network Firewall, NGFW and DCFW;


• | configuration of the physical aspects of the appliance such as ports, onboard Wi-Fi and switching;


• | extending the Fortinet Security Fabric by directly managing FortiSwitch and FortiAP devices;


• | key network functions such as routing and deployment modes (network routing, transparent, sniffer, etc.);


• | implementation of security updates from our FortiGuard distribution network, delivering ATP, such as IPS, antivirus and application control;


• | access to cloud-based web and email filtering databases;


• | direct integration with both cloud and on premises FortiSandbox technology;


• | security policy objects and enforcement;

• | data leak prevention and document finger printing; and


• | real-time reporting and logging.

FortiOS also enables advanced, integrated routing and switching, allowing end-customers to deploy FortiGate devices within a wide variety of networks, as well as providing a direct replacement solution option for legacy switching and routing equipment. FortiOS implements a suite of commonly used standards-based routing protocols as well as network address translation technologies, allowing the FortiGate appliance to integrate and operate in a wide variety of network environments. Additional features include virtual domain capabilities, which can provide support for multiple customers on a single device or FortiOS instance. FortiOS also provides capabilities for logging of traffic for forensic analysis purposes that are particularly important for regulatory compliance initiatives like payment card industry data security standard. FortiOS is designed to help control network traffic in order to optimize performance by including functionality such as packet classification, queue disciplines, policy enforcement, congestion management, WAN optimization and caching. These features enable administrators to set the appropriate configurations and policies that meet their infrastructure needs. We make updates to FortiOS available through our FortiCare technical support services. 
Products
Our core product offerings consist of our FortiGate product family, along with our non-FortiGate products, all of which may be purchased to complement commercial and enterprise deployments. Our FortiGate hardware and software licenses are sold with a set of broad security services. These security services are enabled by FortiGuard which provides extensive threat research and artificial intelligence capabilities from a global cloud network to deliver protection services to each FortiGate appliance. Our non-FortiGate products include the Fortinet Security Fabric (such as FortiSandbox, FortiSIEM and FortiManager), cloud security products (such as Fabric virtual machines and cloud services) and other products. 
FortiGate
Our flagship FortiGate hardware appliances and software offer a broad set of security and networking functions, including firewall, intrusion prevention, anti-malware, VPN, application control, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. All FortiGate models run on our FortiOS operating system. FortiGate platforms can be centrally managed through both embedded web-based and command line interfaces, as well as through FortiManager, which provides central management architecture for thousands of FortiGate hardware appliance and software licenses across a range of hypervisor platforms.
By combining multiple network security functions in our purpose-built security platform, the FortiGate appliances provide broad, high-quality protection capabilities and deployment flexibility while reducing the operational burden and costs associated with managing multiple point products. With over 30 models in the FortiGate product line, FortiGate is designed to address security requirements for small- to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government organizations worldwide.
Typically, all FortiGate hardware appliances include our SPUs to accelerate content and network security features implemented within FortiOS. The significant differences between each model are the performance and scalability targets each model is designed to meet, while the security features and associated services offered are common throughout all models. The FortiGate-20 through -100 series models are designed for perimeter protection for small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises with distributed offices. The FortiGate-200 through -900 series models are designed for perimeter deployment in medium-sized to large enterprise networks. The FortiGate-1000 through -7000 series models deliver high performance and scalable network security functionality for perimeter, data center and core deployment in large enterprises.
We also incorporate additional technologies within FortiGate appliances that differentiate our solutions, including data leakage protection, traffic optimization, secure socket layer inspection, threat vulnerability management and wireless controller technology. In addition to these in-built features, we offer a full range of wireless access points and controllers, complementing FortiGate with the flexibility of wireless local area network access.

FortiSandbox
The FortiSandbox technology delivers proactive detection and mitigation with the capability to generate a directly actionable protection capability. Available in both hardware and cloud-based form, the FortiSandbox technology has a dual-layer sandbox complemented by FortiGuard’s anti-malware intelligence. FortiSandbox allows suspicious code to be subject to a set of multi-layer protection techniques culminating in execution within an operating system to allow detailed real-time behavioral analysis to be performed. When malicious code is identified in this way, a signature can be generated locally for distribution across the Fortinet Security Fabric. Additional insight on the nature of the threat is provided through an intuitive dashboard showing threat information, including system activity, exploit efforts, web traffic and any related subsequent downloads. In addition to integrating within FortiOS, the FortiSandbox can also deliver its detection and local threat intelligence to registered FortiMail, FortiWeb appliances and FortiClient enabled end points. 
FortiSIEM
Our FortiSIEM family of products provides a cloud-ready security information and event management (“SIEM”) solution for enterprises and service providers. FortiSIEM unifies analytics that are traditionally monitored discretely, parses the information and then processes it in an event-based analytics engine for handling real-time searches, rules, dashboards and ad-hoc queries. This unification of diverse sources of data enables organizations to create comprehensive dashboards and reports to identify root causes of threats, and take the steps necessary to remediate and prevent them in the future. Our FortiSIEM products are available either through subscription or perpetual licenses.  
FortiSwitch
Our FortiSwitch product family provides secure switching solutions. It can be deployed in traditional network switching designs with layer 2 and layer 3 access control features. FortiSwitch is part of Fortinet’s Security Fabric solution. FortiSwitch within Fortinet Security Fabric creates a scalable and secure access layer on which customers depend for connecting their end devices, such as computers and laptops, as well as an expanding field of IoT devices.

Manufacturing and Suppliers
We outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Our current manufacturing partners include Micro-Star International Co., Wistron Corporation, Flextronics International Ltd, Senao Networks, Inc., Adlink Technology, Inc. and a number of manufacturers located in Taiwan and other countries outside the United States. We submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery date and other delivery terms. Once our products are manufactured, they are sent to either our warehouse in California, or to our logistics partner in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, where accessory packaging and quality-control testing are performed. We believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies. Our proprietary SPUs, which are the key to the performance of our appliances, are built by contract manufacturers including Faraday Technology Corporation (“Faraday”), Kawasaki Microelectronics America, Inc. and Renesas Electronics Corporation (“Renesas”). These contract manufacturers use foundries operated by either United Microelectronics Corporation (“UMC”) or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”), or their own foundry, such as Renesas’ fab.
The components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers. Some of the components important to our business, including specific types of CPUs from Intel Corporation (“Intel”), network chips from Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”), Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (“Marvell”) and Intel, and solid-state drives (silicon-based storage devices) from Intel, ADATA Technology Co., Ltd. (“ADATA”), OCZ Technology Group, Inc. (“OCZ”), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”), and Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (“Western Digital”), are available from a limited or sole source of supply.
We have no long-term contracts related to the manufacturing of our ASICs or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms.
Research and Development
We focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and services, and adding new features to existing products and services. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that are, or are expected to be, important to our end-customers. Our success in designing, developing, manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors, including the identification of market demand for new products, product selection, timely implementation of product design and development, product performance, effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing. Our research and development expense was $210.6 million, $183.1 million and $158.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Intellectual Property 
We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of December 31, 2017, we had 467 issued U.S.- and foreign-issued patents and 291 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
Despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. We typically indemnify our end-customers, distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties.
Seasonality
For information regarding seasonality in our sales, see the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quarterly Results of Operations—Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:

•product performance, features, effectiveness, interoperability and reliability;
•our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise;
•compliance with industry standards and certifications;
•price of products and services and total cost of ownership;
•brand recognition;
•customer service and support;
•sales and distribution capabilities;
•size and financial stability of operations; and
•breadth of product line.
Among others, our competitors include Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), F5 Networks, Inc. (“F5 Networks”), FireEye, Inc. (“FireEye”), Forcepoint LLC (“Forcepoint”), Imperva, Inc. (“Imperva”), Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper”), McAfee, LLC. (“McAfee”), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (“Palo Alto Networks”), Proofpoint, Inc. (“Proofpoint”), SonicWALL, Inc. (“SonicWALL”), Sophos Group Plc (“Sophos”), Symantec Corporation (“Symantec”) and Trend Micro Incorporated (“Trend Micro”).
We believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance, reliability and breadth, our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise. Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality.
 7

Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance, market their products better, or achieve greater market acceptance than us. In addition, our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers in these markets, and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, our total headcount was 5,066 employees and contractors. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union; however, our employees in certain European countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain up-to-date union membership. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
