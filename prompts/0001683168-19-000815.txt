ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until: (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from:
 
Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which requires companies to hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
The requirement to provide in any registration statement periodic report or other report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K or selected financial data under Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period before the earliest audited period presented in our initial registration statement;
 
Compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies;
 
The requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide auditor attestation of our internal controls and procedures; and
 
Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, or an expanded auditor report and any other PCAOB rules subsequently adopted, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines the new rules are necessary for protecting the public.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
 
Vitalibis, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on April 11, 2014, as a Nevada corporation, under the name Crowd 4 Seeds, Inc. On January 9, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to "Sheng Ying Entertainment Corp." On December 16, 2017, new management took over control of the Company and, on February 5, 2018, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to “Vitalibis, Inc”.
 
As of December 31, 2017, and through current date, most of our resources and work have been devoted to adopting and integrating our new business plan, research and development, seeking capital to finance our operations and complying with our obligations under applicable securities laws, rules and regulations.
 
We are a public company and, as such, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses for legal, accounting and related services. As a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $80,000 per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases, based on our overall business volume (and financial transactions), and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization (if ever). These obligations will certainly reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use non-cash means of settling outstanding obligations (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock) and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts. We will also reduce compensation levels paid to management (if we attract or retain outside personnel to perform this function) if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs.

We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons and/or firms providing services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. However, these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management. The Company may offer shares of its common stock to settle a portion of the professional fees incurred in connection with its registration statement. No negotiations have taken place with any professional and no assurances can be made as to the likelihood that any professional will accept shares in settlement of obligations due to them.
 
Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
Going Concern
 
Our auditor has issued a “going concern” qualification as part of its opinion in the Audit Reports for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, disclosing that our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent on us being able to raise working capital to grow our operations and generate revenue. There can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
Previous Business
 
The Company initially, under the management of Itzhak Ostashinsky, planned to operate in the field of crowd funding and to run an online platform for investments in Israeli startup companies. Those plans never materialized, and there were no operations by the Company during the tenure of Mr. Ostashinsky.
 
On December 30, 2016, in a change-of-control transaction (“2106 Change of Control”), Tycoon Luck Global Limited acquired 65.72% of the equity interest of the Company from Itzhak Ostashinsky, the major shareholder and sole officer of the Company at the time, for $220,152 in cash, and both parties agreed all the net liabilities of the Company as of the acquisition date would be assumed by Itzhak Ostashinsky. On the same day, the new management team was appointed. The new management then decided to transition the Company’s business plan to provide sub-junket services to main junkets based in Cambodia.
 
In furtherance of that new plan, the Company was intending to acquire Sheng Ying Investments Limited, a BVI company incorporated on January 5, 2017, and wholly-owned by Kok Chee LEE, the then-CEO of the Company; however, that plan never materialized and was abandoned due to the change in control and management in October 2017. There were no operations by the Company during the tenure of Kok Chee LEE.
 
On October 24, 2017, in furtherance of a change-of-control transaction (“2017 Change of Control”), Kok Chee LEE resigned from his positions as CEO and director of the Company, and the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Thomas Raack as a director of the Company. On October 25, 2017, Siew Heok Ong resigned from his positions as director and CFO of the Company, and Sreyneang Jin resigned from her positions as director and COO of the Company. On October 26, 2017, Thomas Raack, the sole remaining director of the Company, appointed himself as the CEO, president and treasurer of the Company, and also terminated David E. Price as secretary and appointed himself as secretary of the Company.
 
Current Business
 
Commencing in December 2017, the Company changed its business to focus on the development of technologies and products related to hemp-based personal care and nutritional products.

The Hemp Market
 
Our current business plan, which is in the early stages of operations, marketing and sales of our products, is focused exclusively on the non-medicinal hemp-based product market which includes full spectrum oils with naturally occurring cannabidiol ("CBD") along with other elements of the hemp plant including cannabinoids, terpenes, chlorophyll, flavonoids, etc.
 
Full spectrum oil can be produced from hemp, which is a legal crop in the United States. Scientific research is now bringing to light the many health benefits of full spectrum hemp-based products.
 
Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On December 16, 2017, Sheng Ying Entertainment, Inc. (the “Registrant”), as Buyer, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Steven Raack, an individual; Thomas A. Raack, an individual; and Larry McNabb, an individual, as Sellers, whereby the Registrant acquired certain intangible assets from Sellers relating to non-medicinal hemp-based personal care and nutritional products that include: (a) certain proprietary technology and intellectual property; (b) certain proprietary ideas, know-how, proposed business plans and concepts; and (c) a proposed marketing plan combined with related experiential marketing strategies (the “Technology”), together, the “Assets”. The Assets consist of plans and intellectual property, only, and do not include fixed assets or tangible property or products, and constitute the intangible personal property developed solely by Sellers. Each of the Sellers own 33.33% of the Assets and Sellers together own 100%of all rights, titles and interests in and to the Assets.
 
As full consideration for the Assets, the Registrant issued 22,500,000 restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $.001, with each Seller receiving 7,500,000 shares. Due to the change of control and related party nature of the transaction a carry-over basis of $0 was assigned.
 
Steven Raack and Thomas A. Raack are brothers, and Thomas A. Raack was, on the date of the Agreement, a Director, CEO, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. Subsequent to the acquisition, Steven Raack was appointed as a Director, Thomas A. Raack resigned as CEO and President, and Steven Raack was appointed as the CEO and President.
 
The Company
 
Vitalibis is a socially conscious brand focused on people, products and the planet. We are a technology-based formulator of premium, full spectrum phytocannabinoid rich hemp products with naturally occurring cannabidiol (CBD), along with safe personal care and nutritional products.  Our Ambassador program combines critical elements of social selling, ecommerce and affiliate marketing into one highly focused business system which empowers our people and social mission-driven ecosystem.
Operations
 Consumer Products and Technology SaaS
 
We market and sell consumer products containing full spectrum phytocannabinoid rich hemp oil with naturally occurring CBD under our Vitalibis™ brand in a range of market sectors including wellness, and personal care. We currently distribute 3 Vitalibis™ branded products and we expect to continue to add new products to our Vitalibis™ portfolio to enhance our line of full spectrum phytocannabinoid rich hemp products with naturally occurring cannabidiol (CBD) and hemp-related consumer products. We also expect to develop and launch new brands under the Vitalibis™ product development umbrella to more effectively market and sell certain products. We also sell water soluble full spectrum phytocannabinoid rich hemp powder with naturally occurring cannabidiol (CBD) acquired through our supply relationships in the United States to various customers that produce products for resale into the market. We also began offering non-exclusive leases of our proprietary Vitalibis technology back-end, which is being offered as a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform.
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of industrial hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements, and much more. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, and we believe Vitalibis™ is well positioned to have a demonstrable impact on the rapidly emerging hemp industry.

Hemp-derived CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based supplier oversees our raw material supply chain and raw material processing. Our internal team manages product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.
 
We expect to realize revenue to fund our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our product development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to fund our product development efforts, we may need to curtail or delay such activity.
 
Inventory and Sales
 
Based on expected increasing demand, we have invested significant capital to develop and maintain our relationship with a proprietary oil extraction supplier to ensure access to raw materials to support anticipated revenue growth. We have historically sourced our raw materials from this well-established hemp oil supplier in the United States. We have maintained access to this supplier for their raw material supply, and continue to explore and develop the relationship to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for hemp oil products well into the future. However, our current inventory levels are not sufficient to support sales through 2019
 
Changes in the Law and Development Programs
 
For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new Federal law allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp “in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.”
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio-plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that, today, includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies that use hemp oil to develop consumer products for distribution. We believe that as consumer and market awareness increases, products derived from hemp/cannabis and the consumer market will evolve and grow into a new commercial industry
 
Our target customers for our consumer product segment are, first and foremost, hemp-related consumers who we seek to attract to our products via internet sales, direct-to-consumer, affiliate sales and Ambassador distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufacturers of products that can, and will, readily replace their existing raw base materials for our base materials, making their respective products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. In the future, we may pursue national and regional broker networks and major distribution companies who have pre-existing relationships with major retail chain stores. To date, we have taken no steps, nor do we have any plans to take any steps to identify or contact any such broker networks or major distribution companies In addition, we are may pursue distribution opportunities with national retailers. To date, we have taken no steps, nor do we have any plans to take any steps to identify or contact any such distribution opportunities. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.
 

Competition
 
There are several companies developing and utilizing cannabinoid for a range of products. The cannabinoid area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC, as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies, such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC, have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies, such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc., have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.

The CBD-based consumer product industry is currently highly fragmented with numerous companies, many of which may be under-capitalized. We plan to routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities in an effort to enhance our business operations and financial results, as well as provide value for shareholders through new product development, asset acquisitions and/or sales. Another source of competition may come from large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products.
 
We may also compete with other CBD-related technology and product companies for financing from a limited number of investors that may be prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing companies in our field of endeavor may impact our ability to raise initial, needed capital in order to fund our business plan and operations. If investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive, based on the merit of their technologies, their products, the advanced stage of their marketing or development, or the price of the investment opportunity, we may not obtain our needed financing.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in developing and manufacturing their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities, name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and proposed products) obsolete.
 
These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 

• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


• | more advanced technologies and product development;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 
We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks including, but not limited to Vitalibis™.
 
We built a proprietary robust technology platform utilizing highly scalable peer-to-peer sales technology. The technology includes: Administrative back-end module Customer Data Management Reporting and Metrics Customer Support Customer Relationship Management (CRM). We also intend to develop payment processing, engagement campaigns, (using patent-pending newkleus technology) mobile application tools, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. We intend to explore patents related to this technology in the future.
 
We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis and we will continue in our efforts to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. We may also file for patent protection on our products based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development costs have consisted primarily of stock-based compensation to pay for related personnel expense, facilities and other costs related to both our consumer product and our technology. We charge all research and development expenses to operations, as incurred, in the ongoing development of new consumer products.

Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
Reports to Security Holders
 
We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. After the effectiveness of this Registration Statement we will begin filing Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s operations.
 
The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements. While our proposed business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our anticipated potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our proposed products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any employees. Steve Raack and Tom Raack each intend to devote about 40 hours per week on our proposed operations. The Company will consider employing staff in the future, but only if our business is growing and cash flow will support such staff.
Litigation
 
We are not party to any pending, or to our knowledge, threatened litigation of any type.
