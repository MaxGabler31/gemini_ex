ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Bubblr, Inc is a company founded on the principles of digital disruption, innovation and the emerging importance of ethical Internet applications. Our objective is to fix a broken internet model that currently suffers from the following failures: 

1. | Reckless abuse of an individual's personal data;
---+-------------------------------------------------


2. | Prohibitively expensive and complex businesses marketing channels:
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Insufficient revenues for content creators and online participants outside of those at the very top.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Bubblr brings a holistic approach to the above problems in a fundamentally unique way. Building on its patented alternative online search mechanism and engaging with the global digital developer community, we are building a new economic platform that we believe will be fundamentally sustainable and fair to users, online businesses, and all online stakeholders. Our mission is to empower the developers of a new Internet in creating Ethical Technologies through our Intellectual Property, providing advanced digital tools that enable developers and creators to build fair-forward solutions to build a new Ethical Internet Ecosystem (the “Ethical Web” or WEB.Ɛ).
 The 5 pillars of WEB.Ɛ are:
 
· | An internet that decentralizes profits.
--+----------------------------------------


· | An internet that consecrates citizens’ rights to privacy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | An internet that levels the playing field for businesses
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | An internet that combats social and cultural division.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | An internet that is not corrupted by advertising.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
Open-Source Ecosystem
 Understanding that the WEB.Ɛ concept is larger than any one entity and deploys multiple layers of technologies across multiple business sectors, we are building an Open-Source Platform (OSP) to engage the world’s developers and engineers in the cause for a more equitable Internet, at the DNA level. With our own intellectual property at its core, we will construct our OSP with the developer community in mind, incorporating a number of related digital tools that support the ethical development of new mobile applications that adhere to and reflect the highest standers of WEB.Ɛ.
 Intellectual Property
 We have created a new search mechanism, which has been granted a patent in South Africa (2016/06947), New Zealand(725014), and in the United States (‘Utility Patent No. US 10977387, AN INTERNET-BASED SEARCH MECHANISM’.). We have patents pending on the same processes in Canada (2962520), Australia (2015248619), E.U. (15723990.6) and the United Kingdom (PCT/GB2015/051130), creating an alternative economic ecosystem to tackle the current broken model and better serve all main participant groups. Our work ensures that users, content publishers, and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) are better protected and rewarded in their online experiences.
 Bubblr is currently in the process of filing a  sister patent to our approved INTERNET SEARCH MECHANISM. This patent will define an alternative mobile search system purely for information rather than goods and service, which our original patent covers. This new search mechanism is designed to radically change the way search is conducted for information and will bear little resemblance to the established search model. Details of the mobile search app will become available upon formal filing.

Web3/Ɛ as Growth Ecosystem
 Bubblr is in the process of pivoting to a software as a service (SAAS) Open Source Platform to allow the open-source community, companies and not-for-profits to be able to build their own mobile applications using open source templates downloadable from a central code repository. As partners register onto our platform, they are provisioned with online consoles that allow them to fully utilize the SAAS platform and will have their own sandbox provisioned to test their apps.
 All of the consumer-based products subsequently developed by registered partners are designed to deliver the presentation layer through mobile-first consumer experiences. Bubblr eschews delivery of consumer products through browsers, as they are inherently vulnerable to interference by bad actors.
  We are developing our WEB.Ɛ (our more ethical derivative of Web 3.0) platform by concentrating on proven value methodologies designed to exponentially increase the adoption of our IP through the following trifurcated process:
  1. Research & Development. Through an Open Source Initiative designed to evolve our IP (developed under patent). This allows us to identify growth areas and expand ecosystems, platforms, and products within those areas.
  2. Licensing and SAAS. We will provide revenue opportunities through partnerships with select start-ups and established corporations to further our reach and rapid development of platform applications. The SAAS platform will allow low volume, free community access. However, platform usage is metered, and those partners who start using the platform for larger volume will be obliged to pay an appropriate license fee.
  3. Venture Fund. We will license and provide our technology to select start-ups, teams and developers, and fund early stage startups that deploy promising applications arising from the platform. This will allow us to grow a multi-sector ecosystem and maximize reach and revenues through multiple avenues.
Related Developer Tools and Services
 We have  developed a data-driven conversations (DDC) capability that is in the process of being implemented into our platform and app technologies. This generic application can be used by developers with access to our toolkit and will allow Bubblr to build and alter conversation search dialogues to optimize searching for information and content.
  For example, allowing users to filter news articles they receive is limited to their chosen geographical area. The DDC capability can also be reused as an essential component of our open-source platform to provide generic conversation e-commerce capabilities. Our DDC offer is not a chatbot but rather a generic data-driven questionnaire system that can be deployed within apps without requiring any extra coding. Moreover, it operates using mobile app components that use 'finger taps' rather than entering text using a keyboard.
 Additionally, we have been building complex AI and machine learning to optimize search results regarding relevance and salience for searching for news. Again, these news-based search algorithms will also be reused within the open-source platform and development ecosystems and may be added to our overall Software Development Kit (SDK).
 The systems architecture to support these systems has evolved. Our current belief is that a collection of technologies is the perfect platform to deliver our solutions in an open-source setting. 
 We have a combination of Postgres SQL (a scalable relational database that can integrate and manipulate JSON documents) and Elastic Search, which has become the NoSQL document database of choice for delivering very high volume document data sets with built-in machine learning and AI capabilities.

We have managed to integrate these two very different and unique database platforms in powerful ways that allow us to data-drive all our products in ways that other companies will find it difficult in terms of time and money to successfully emulate.
 This means that most of our crucial API's never have to be altered with the apps we produce or that our partners deliver. However, we still retain the capacity to radically enhance the behavior of our technology without having to issue new versions.
 We have also integrated open-source NLP (Natural Language Processing) into our products and platforms to include NLP as an intrinsic part of our search functionality. Utilizing NLP and Named Entity Recognition (NER), we can significantly evaluate news stories' relevance and salience to improve any native product search experience.
 Competition
  The space for online marketplaces and ad networks is rapidly evolving. The Advertising Technology (Ad-tech) industry includes all kinds of tools, software platforms (Google, Facebook), agencies, data-brokers, etc. It facilitates targeted advertisements that have become exponentially more invasive over the past decade due to massive amounts of personal data collection. It's a complex and opaque ecosystem that tracks, profiles, discriminates (both personal and business) and manipulates for profit. It's a multi-billion dollar industry that is now facing litigation, investigations, and new regulations to curb its practices.
 We face intense competition from companies with much larger capital resources than us, and, as a result, we could struggle to attract users and gain market share. Many of our existing or future competitors have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. We will strive to advance our technology in each of these sectors ahead of our competitors to gain market share. We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to compensate employees competitively. We face significant competition in several aspects of our business, and such competition might increase, particularly in the market for networks and online marketplaces. A key advantage against better resourced competitors is provisioning our technology and related acquisitions as an Open Source SAAS platform. This pushes all of the consumer and merchant marketing responsibility to the registered partners. 
 Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or the needs of users, such as mobile access or different market focus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business or decreased user activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 We believe that we have competitive strengths and protection via our IP which is defensible under the umbrella protection of our granted patents. 
  Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online, many of which are evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws and regulations relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, or the content provided by users. Further, some countries impose regulations regarding or require licenses to conduct various aspects of our business, including employee recruiting and news related services. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users or other third parties could harm our business. In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities, may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our website platform, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our platform.

In the area of information security and data protection, most states have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of amendments or changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including visitor and user data. Any failure by us to comply with these terms or privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their application to online services are unclear, evolving and in a state of flux. For example, in October 2015, the highest court in the European Union invalidated reliance on the US-EU Safe Harbor regime as one of the legally recognized mechanisms under which the personal data of European citizens could be transferred to the United States. There is a risk that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices or that new laws or regulations will be enacted. In addition, because our platform will be accessible worldwide, certain foreign governments may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations, including with respect to the storage, use and disclosure of user information, even in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure. Complying with these varying domestic and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Employees
 
As of March 25, 2022, we have 6 full-time employees, 4 contractors and 1 part-time employee.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us.
Smaller Reporting Company
 
The Company is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a “smaller reporting company,” these exemptions will continue to be available to us.
