 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative vaccines in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in vaccines and our proven vaccine adjuvant technology. We are currently focused on our efforts to drive long-term shareholder value by maximizing utilization of our HEPLISAV-B® hepatitis B vaccine, advancing our CpG 1018® adjuvant supply strategy, most notably through COVID-19 collaborations, and expanding our portfolio of innovative vaccine candidates leveraging our proven adjuvant technology.
 Our first marketed product, HEPLISAV-B (Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted), is approved in the United States and European Union for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus ("HBV") in adults age 18 years and older. HEPLISAV-B is the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine for adults approved in the U.S. and European Union. In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated faster and higher rates of protection with two doses in one month compared to another currently approved hepatitis B vaccine, which requires three doses over six months, with a similar safety profile. We have worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B and we market it in the United States. We received Marketing Authorization approval of HEPLISAV-B in February 2021 from the European Commission for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of HBV in adults age 18 years and older. In May 2021, we entered into a commercialization agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the marketing and distribution of HEPLISAV-B in Germany and we expect to begin distribution in 2022.
 We also manufacture and sell CpG 1018 adjuvant, the vaccine adjuvant used in HEPLISAV-B. We developed CpG 1018 adjuvant to provide an increased vaccine immune response, which has been demonstrated in real world commercial use and in a wide range of clinical trials. We are expanding the use of our adjuvant to support the development and potential large-scale manufacturing of additional vaccines through collaborations with multiple vaccine companies, academic groups and in our own vaccine development programs. Current adjuvant supply collaborations primarily include a diverse, global portfolio of COVID-19 vaccine developers.
We expect to drive future innovation through our clinical pipeline and discovery efforts. Currently, we have three clinical development programs, and additional pre-clinical and clinical collaborations:
-Our tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (“Tdap”) booster vaccine candidate, adjuvanted with CpG 1018, is in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine, with topline data for adults expected in the first half of 2022, and topline data for adolescents expected in the second half of 2022. 
 -Our investigational shingles vaccine candidate, adjuvanted with CpG 1018, is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine, with topline data expected by the end of 2022.
 -In collaboration with, and fully funded by, the U.S. Department of Defense, we plan to conduct a phase 2 clinical trial for a plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, which is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2022.
 -We are also working to advance product candidates utilizing our CpG 1018 adjuvant through pre-clinical and clinical collaborations and additional discovery efforts with third-party research organizations, including an ongoing collaboration with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ("Mount Sinai"), investigating universal and seasonal influenza vaccine candidates.
 Adjuvant Technology Overview: Toll-like Receptor Immune Modulation Platform
 Toll-like receptors (“TLRs”) are a family of transmembrane proteins that play a vital role in innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity. Signaling through these receptors is triggered by the binding of a variety of pathogen-associated molecules and is essential to generation of innate immunity. The innate immune response is, in effect, the first line of defense against viruses, bacteria and other potential pathogens. The innate response also initiates and regulates the generation of an adaptive immune response composed of highly specific antibodies and T cells. Compounds that stimulate enhanced immune responses are generally referred to as adjuvants.
 Our work in this area has been focused primarily on stimulation of a subset of TLRs that have evolved to recognize bacterial and viral nucleic acids. This work resulted in the identification of proprietary unmethlyated synthetic

oligonucleotides (short segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”)), that mimic the activity of microbial DNA, and selectively activate one of these important receptors, TLR9. These TLR9 agonists are called CpG oligonucleotides – or “CpGs” for short – referring to the presence of specific nucleotide sequences containing the CG base pair.
Our vaccine research to date has focused on the use of TLR9 agonists as novel vaccine adjuvants. B-Class TLR9 agonists, such as our CpG 1018 adjuvant, stimulate release of cytokines necessary for T cell activation and establishing long-term immunity. TLR9 stimulation also helps generate memory Th1 cells that can stimulate the immune system to induce long-lasting effects. As a result, TLR9 adjuvanted vaccines induce a specific Th1 immune response and more durable levels of protective antibodies relative to non-adjuvanted vaccines. Our CpG 1018 adjuvant has an established tolerability profile demonstrated in a wide range of clinical trials and real-world, commercial use, and has consistently demonstrated its ability to enhance the immune response without excessive reactogenicity in HEPLISAV-B and multiple COVID-19 clinical trials.
Key 2021 Highlights and Performance Against Core Priorities
 
Maximize Growth of HEPLISAV-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted]
-We recognized approximately $61.9 million in product revenue related to sales of HEPLISAV-B in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a 72% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in HEPLISAV-B demand and market share gains in the U.S. in 2021, compared to 2020;
 -In April 2021, we announced the results of the post-marketing study assessing the rates of occurrence of acute myocardial infarction ("AMI") in persons receiving HEPLISAV-B compared with Engerix-B. The results provided evidence there is no increased risk of AMI associated with vaccination with HEPLISAV-B compared to Engerix-B; and
 -In October 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (“CDC”) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) recommended that all adults aged 19-59 be vaccinated against hepatitis-B. This universal recommendation created a significantly expanded market opportunity in the U.S., compared to the more limited prior recommendation to vaccinate at-risk populations, which we believe has greatly simplified prescribing practices.
Expand CpG 1018 Adjuvant Supply Business for COVID-19 Vaccines
 -We recognized approximately $375.2 million in product revenue related to sales of CpG 1018 adjuvant to our global portfolio of partners developing COVID-19 vaccines during the year ended December 31, 2021. This represented a transformative increase compared to $3.3 million in adjuvant sales during the year ended December 31, 2020;
 -Two of our adjuvant collaborators’ COVID-19 vaccine candidates, adjuvanted with CpG 1018, were approved for emergency use during the year ended December 31, 2021; additional collaborators’ successful phase 3 clinical data consistently demonstrated the value of CpG 1018 adjuvant across multiple vaccine platforms; and
 -We continued to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet our partners’ needs for adjuvant in 2022 and beyond.
 
Drive Innovation Through Clinical Pipeline Expansion and Discovery
 -We continued enrollment and made progress on our Tdap-1018 phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine, with topline data in adults and adolescents expected during 2022;
 -In September 2021, we entered into a fully-funded collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial for a plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, which is expected to start in 2022;
 -In January 2022, we announced the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of our investigational shingles vaccine candidate adjuvanted with CpG 1018; and
 -During the year, we further invested in our pre-clinical and clinical collaborations and discovery efforts, including our ongoing collaboration with Mount Sinai investigating universal and seasonal influenza.
Corporate and Financial Highlights
 -We delivered net income of $76.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing our first full year of profitability;


-We generated $335.5 million in positive cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2021, and ended the year with $546.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;
 -We issued $225.5 million in 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2026. We used $190.2 million of the net proceeds to repay, in full, our previously outstanding 9.5% term loan due 2023, and $27.2 million to pay the costs of capped call transactions; and
 -We increased the funding under our arrangement with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (“CEPI”) in May 2021 to approximately $176.4 million, which supported the advance manufacturing cost of CpG 1018 adjuvant sold to or reserved for certain of our collaborators working to advance COVID-19 vaccine candidates, adjuvanted with CpG 1018.
 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic to our Business
Significant uncertainties remain with respect to the extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations. The pandemic has resulted in changes to our business and operations which impacted our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, and it may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition in the future. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In the process, we have made proactive efforts designed to help protect the health and safety of our workforce, as well as those of patients and healthcare professionals, while preserving the continuity of our business operations and advancing our goal of bringing important new vaccines to patients as rapidly as possible. While adult hepatitis B vaccine utilization rates have continued to stay below pre-pandemic levels, we are starting to see a recovery in such utilization from all-time lows. Additionally, HEPLISAV-B continues to gain market share in the U.S. hepatitis B adult vaccine market. The impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial condition is more fully described below in Part II, Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Our Strategy
 Our vision is to become a leading vaccines company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative vaccines in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in vaccines and our proven vaccine adjuvant technology. Our strategy is focused on three core priorities: drive growth in our HEPLISAV-B vaccine, execute on our CpG 1018 adjuvant supply business and drive innovation through clinical pipeline expansion and discovery. Key elements of our strategy include:
•driving growth in our HEPLISAV-B vaccine (i) in the U.S. through expansion of overall market share and market share for the accounts which we target directly with our field-based salesforce and (ii) collaborating with global partners who share our vision, values, culture, and processes to develop and commercialize our HEPLISAV-B vaccine outside of the U.S.;
 •delivering our proprietary CpG 1018 adjuvant to a diverse portfolio of global collaborators for COVID-19 vaccine development;
 •expanding our clinical research pipeline by leveraging our demonstrated expertise and proven adjuvant technology in areas of unmet need, including for improved vaccines that may provide greater immunogenicity, lower reactogenicity and longer immune durability compared to currently marketed products;
 •assembling a passionate team with demonstrated clinical and commercial success in discovering, developing and marketing vaccines that protect the world against infectious diseases;
 •evaluating innovative, externally developed products for in-licensing or acquisition opportunities, with priority given to vaccine assets that address clear unmet need, provide scientific innovation, sound mechanistic rationale, a strong clinical safety profile, and a clear development path towards commercialization in disease areas primarily managed by our existing field-based salesforce footprint; and
 •executing our strategy with our stockholders’ long-term interests in mind and focusing on long-term, sustainable value creation over time.
  HEPLISAV-B (Hepatitis B Vaccine, (Recombinant), Adjuvanted)
 Our first commercial product, HEPLISAV-B (Hepatitis B Vaccine, (Recombinant), Adjuvanted), is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the European Commission for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of HBV in adults age 18 years and older. HEPLISAV-B combines CpG 1018, our proprietary TLR9

agonist adjuvant, and recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (“rHBsAg” or “HBsAg”) that is manufactured by Dynavax GmbH, our wholly owned subsidiary, in Düsseldorf, Germany. HEPLISAV-B and each of the vaccines it directly competes against use rHBsAg to elicit an immune response to the virus.
About Hepatitis B
 Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the HBV which may cause chronic infection and put people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no cure for hepatitis B, but the disease can be prevented through effective vaccination. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the CDC have set a goal to eliminate all viral hepatitis infections, including hepatitis B, globally by 2030, and are calling for a continued commitment to increase services to eliminate hepatitis. The WHO estimates that worldwide, approximately 296 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B in 2019. In addition, the CDC estimated that in 2016 approximately 862,000 people in the U.S. were living with HBV infection. There were a total of 3,322 new cases of acute hepatitis B reported to the CDC in 2018. However, after adjusting for under-ascertainment and under reporting, the CDC estimated that 21,600 acute hepatitis B cases occurred in the U.S. in 2018.
 Recommendations for Adult Vaccination to Prevent Hepatitis B
The CDC’s ACIP unanimously voted at its November 2021 meeting to recommend that all adults 19 to 59 years of age should receive a hepatitis B vaccination. This universal recommendation greatly simplifies the identification of patients who need a hepatitis B vaccine compared to the previous risk-based recommendation, and significantly expands the number of adults in the United States who should be vaccinated against hepatitis B under CDC recommendation.
This recommendation is a significant milestone for hepatitis B prevention, making hepatitis B the fifth vaccine routinely recommended for adult immunization along with influenza, Tdap, shingles and pneumococcal. Based on this opportunity, we have begun to launch innovative marketing campaigns targeting consumers and healthcare providers to increase the awareness of HEPLISAV-B as the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine option, with broad protection across most patient types.
Protection Against Hepatitis B by HEPLISAV-B
 The approval of HEPLISAV-B by the FDA was based on data from three Phase 3 non-inferiority trials involving nearly 10,000 adult participants who received HEPLISAV-B. These pivotal studies compared HEPLISAV-B administered in two doses over one month to Engerix-B® administered in three doses over a six-month schedule. Results from HBV-23, the largest Phase 3 trial, which included 6,665 participants, showed that HEPLISAV-B demonstrated a statistically significantly higher rate of protection of 95% compared with 81% for Engerix-B. Across the three clinical trials, the most common local reaction was injection site pain (23% to 39%). The most common systemic reactions were fatigue (11% to 17%) and headache (8% to 17%).
Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B. In addition to HEPLISAV-B, there are four other vaccines approved for the prevention of hepatitis B in the U.S.: Engerix-B and Twinrix® from GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), Recombivax-HB® from Merck & Co. (“Merck”) and PreHevbrio from VBI Vaccines Inc. HEPLISAV-B is currently approved in the U.S. and the EU for the prevention of hepatitis B in adults. We are also considering additional territories where it would be commercially feasible to market HEPLISAV-B.
The largest segments of the market are concentrated in independent hospitals and clinics, integrated delivery networks, dialysis centers, public health clinics and prisons, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs and retail pharmacies. Our promotional activity is focused on the largest accounts in each segment. Our field sales force of approximately 100 people are targeting customers that we believe represent, in the aggregate, approximately 60% of hepatitis B vaccine doses administered in the U.S., with an overall objective to increase market share.
 We continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of HEPLISAV-B. We completed an open-label, single arm study of a 4-dose regimen of HEPLISAV-B in adults with end-stage renal disease who are initiating or undergoing hemodialysis. Final immunogenicity results included a seroprotection rate of 89.3% with high levels of anti-HBs antibodies. Safety data showed HEPLISAV-B was well tolerated and no safety concerns were observed. The safety and effectiveness of HEPLISAV-B in adults on hemodialysis have not yet been established. This study alone, regardless of results, may not be sufficient to support a label change to include dialysis patients. If we receive approval of this dosing schedule, we expect to add dialysis centers to our personal promotion efforts, which could increase our coverage of the U.S. market to approximately 75%.

PROPRIETARY CpG 1018 Vaccine ADJUVANT
 We believe the favorable immunogenicity and safety results achieved with HEPLISAV-B utilizing our CpG 1018 adjuvant support our efforts to develop it as a broadly useful vaccine adjuvant platform. CpG 1018 adjuvant has an established profile for the potential development of safe and effective vaccines. It has a well-defined mechanism of action, targeting select immune system cells, with well-characterized effects on the immune response that mimic the immune response to naturally occurring TLR9 agonists in pathogens. This results in potent adjuvant activity for antibody responses. In HEPLISAV-B, our CpG 1018 adjuvant drives faster and consistently higher rates of seroprotection than Engerix-B, even in the elderly and populations known to be less responsive to other vaccines. CpG 1018 adjuvant differentially elicits a preferred T Helper 1 (“Th1”) cell polarized response and drives protective antibody production. CpG 1018 adjuvant has a large safety database that indicates a favorable reactogenicity profile with lower reactogenicity compared to other adjuvants.
We have established several clinical and preclinical collaborations with vaccine developers to evaluate CpG 1018 adjuvanted vaccine product candidates against flu, other infectious diseases, and particularly COVID-19 across a variety of vaccine platforms. Data from studies in non-human primates demonstrate our CpG 1018 adjuvant can elicit a robust immune response to COVID-19 and protect animals from infection in challenge studies. Results from Phase 2 and 3 human clinical studies demonstrated CpG 1018 adjuvanted vaccines induced a high level of efficacy and strong immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cell-mediated immunity, and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
CpG 1018 Adjuvant Supply Partnerships for COVID-19 Vaccine Development
 To support the fight against COVID-19, we have entered into certain supply relationships with a diverse portfolio of vaccine developers to supply CpG 1018 adjuvant for their use in development and/or commercialization of COVID-19 vaccines. To-date, two of our supply partners’ vaccine candidates utilizing CpG 1018 adjuvant, have been approved for emergency use. Additionally, Phase 3 clinical data from other partnered programs consistently demonstrated the value of our adjuvant across multiple vaccine platforms with additional regulatory authorization for partners' COVID-19 vaccines anticipated in 2022. We continue to expand manufacturing capacity to meet our collaborators’ needs for our adjuvant in 2022 and beyond.
Clover Biopharmaceuticals
 In June 2021, we entered into an agreement with Zhejiang Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Clover Hong Kong Inc. (collectively, “Clover”), for the commercial supply of CpG 1018 adjuvant, for use with Clover’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, SCB-2019 (“Clover Supply Agreement”). Under the Clover Supply Agreement, Clover has committed to purchase specified quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant, at pre-negotiated prices pursuant to an agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (“CEPI”), for use in Clover’s commercialization of vaccines containing SCB-2019 and CpG 1018 adjuvant. The Clover Supply Agreement also provides specified terms for Clover to order and take delivery of additional quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant beyond the quantities reserved by CEPI. In September 2021, Clover reported that SCB-2019 achieved the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, with a favorable safety profile, in a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial.
Biological E. Limited
 In July 2021, we entered into an agreement with Biological E. Limited (“Bio E”), for the commercial supply of CpG 1018 adjuvant, for use with Bio E’s subunit COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CORBEVAX (the “Bio E Supply Agreement”). Under the Bio E Supply Agreement, Bio E has committed to purchase specified quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant, at pre-negotiated prices pursuant to the CEPI Agreement, for use in Bio E’s commercialization of its CORBEVAX vaccine with specified delivery dates in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. The Bio E Supply Agreement also provides specified terms for Bio E to order and take delivery of additional quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant beyond the quantities reserved by CEPI. In December 2021, CORBEVAX received approval for emergency use from the Drugs Controller General of India.
Medigen Vaccine Biologics
 In February 2021, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Medigen Vaccine Biologics (Medigen) to manufacture and supply specified quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant for use in the development and commercialization of Medigen’s COVID-19 vaccine, adjuvanted with our CpG 1018 adjuvant, MVC-COV1901, for delivery in the first and second quarters of 2021. In August 2021, we entered into a second supply agreement to manufacture and supply additional specified

quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant for delivery in the third and fourth quarter of 2021. In August 2021, Medigen launched MVC-COV1901 after receiving Taiwan Emergency Use Authorization and approval for inclusion in Taiwan's COVID-19 vaccine immunization program.
Valneva Scotland Limited
 In the third quarter of 2020, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Valneva Scotland Limited (”Valneva”) to supply CpG 1018 adjuvant for its SARS-COV-2 vaccine candidate, VLA2001, in connection with Valneva’s supply agreement with the United Kingdom Government and subject to the terms of such agreement (“Valneva Supply Agreement”). In September 2021, the United Kingdom Government terminated its supply agreement with Valneva. In October 2021, Valneva reported that VLA2001 met both co-primary endpoints in the COV-COMPARE trial, and that VLA2001 was well-tolerated, demonstrating a statistically significant better tolerability profile compared to active comparator vaccine, AstraZeneca's AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S).
In October 2021, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Valneva Amendment”), amending the Valneva Supply Agreement. Under the Valneva Amendment, we and Valneva agreed to the cancellation of the two then-outstanding purchase orders for CpG 1018 adjuvant under the Valneva Supply Agreement that had not been fulfilled as of the date of the Valneva Amendment, and Valneva concurrently committed to purchase a reduced amount of CpG 1018 adjuvant under a new purchase order. We were entitled to retain the advance payments made by Valneva under such cancelled purchase orders to the extent such advance payments did not count towards the advance payments due under the Valneva Amendment.
Our Vaccine Research and Development Pipeline
 We are building an innovative pipeline of investigational vaccine product candidates, leveraging our proven adjuvant technology. A summary of our pipeline programs follows:
Tdap Vaccine Phase 1 Study
 Pertussis (whooping cough) is a serious illness in people of all ages and can be life-threatening, especially in infants. Whooping cough is caused by the highly contagious respiratory bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. People with pertussis usually spread the disease to others by coughing, sneezing or spending time in the same breathing environment. According to the CDC, there are an estimated 24.1 million cases of pertussis and about 160,700 deaths per year globally. The resurgence of B. pertussis in multiple countries has been attributed to the Tdap vaccine’s limited duration of protection and inability to block nasal colonizing infections, thereby failing to alter transmission. Our Tdap booster vaccine candidate adjuvanted with CpG 1018 is anticipated to improve the durability and protection against pertussis colonization in the upper airways by redirecting T cell responses and enhancing protective antibody responses in a booster vaccine. Initial proof-of-concept preclinical animal model data demonstrated that inclusion of CpG 1018 adjuvant in prime/boost vaccinations reduces bacterial burden in the upper and lower airways compared Tdap vaccination alone.
 In June 2017, we entered into an agreement with Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (“SIIPL”) to collaborate on development and commercialization of certain potential vaccines including Tdap booster adjuvated with CpG1018. Topline data is expected in 2022 from our ongoing Tdap-1018 phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in adults and adolescents. Under the collaboration, we have exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize the vaccine, except that SIIPL has exclusive rights to distribute in India and to fulfill WHO/United Nations Children's Fund (“UNICEF”) tender contracts. Each party is responsible for clinical development cost in their respective territories.
 Herpes Zoster Virus (Shingles) Vaccine Phase 1 Study
 Shingles is an extremely painful consequence of the reactivation of a latent varicella-zoster virus (“VZV”) infection, with attacks leading to potential complications including chronic pain. The current shingles vaccine market is approximately $2 billion and expected to grow over time. Our CpG 1018 adjuvant has demonstrated its ability to enhance the immune response without excessive reactogenicity in both HEPLISAV-B and multiple COVID-19 clinical trials. Importantly, CpG 1018 has shown the ability to generate high levels of CD4+-cells which have been demonstrated to be key cell types in controlling latent VZV infection to avoid reactivation leading to shingles, with potentially lower reactogenicity compared to the current standard of care.
 In January 2022, we announced the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial of our shingles vaccine candidate, adjuvanted with CpG 1018. The global phase 1 study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine

candidate which is comprised of glycoprotein E (gE) plus CpG 1018 adjuvant. Topline data from this trial is expected by the end of 2022.
 U.S. Department of Defense (Plague Vaccine) Phase 2 Study
 In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") for the development of a recombinant plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018 for approximately $22.0 million over two and a half years. Under the agreement, we will conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial combining our CpG 1018 adjuvant with the DoD's rF1V vaccine to show that two doses of CpG 1018 adjuvanted vaccine is non-inferior compared to three doses of the aluminum-adjuvanted vaccine. We anticipate the Phase 2 trial will commence in 2022.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Generally, we seek patent protection in the U.S and foreign countries on a selective basis to further protect the inventions that we or our partners consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
As of December 31, 2021, our intellectual property portfolio included over 25 issued U.S. patents, over 60 granted foreign patents and over 25 additional owned or co-owned pending U.S. and foreign patent applications claiming compositions containing TLR agonists or antagonists, methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture thereof. Some of these patents and patent applications relate to our discontinued immuno-oncology programs. Reductions in counts, relative to prior years, are reflective of the expiration of or decision to discontinue maintenance of older foreign patents that were not relevant to our active vaccine programs. We have three issued U.S. patents relating to certain uses of HEPLISAV-B that expire in 2032.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date.
In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The duration of patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is 20 years from the filing date. Our patent estate, based on patents existing now and expected by us to issue based on pending applications, will expire on dates ranging from 2022 to 2042.
 The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents.
Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing and publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications or in our issued patents. Further, there could be proceedings such as inter partes review (IPR), post grant review (PGR), reexamination, reissue or opposition which could result in claims in our patents being narrowed or even invalidated.
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. A number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and research institutions, may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover inventions similar to the inventions owned by or licensed to us. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make, use or sell any products. If another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products, we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products.
Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party’s proprietary rights. The existence of third-party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. Litigation or any other proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities, require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties, or require us to cease using some of our technology. We may not prevail in these actions or proceedings, if any.

In addition, other parties may duplicate, design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology. Although trade secrets are difficult to protect, wherever possible, we use confidential disclosure agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology. Our policy is to require each of our collaborators, commercial partners, employees, consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and/or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
COMPETITION
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our products and development programs compete with several commercially available vaccine and adjuvant products. Many companies and institutions are making substantial investments in developing additional vaccines and adjuvants that could compete directly or indirectly with our marketed products and products under development by us and our collaborators. For example, while we recently announced a new shingles vaccine candidate, around the same time, Pfizer and Biontech also announced competing shingles programs. The approved products from these programs will all need to compete with a single approved vaccine currently available in the U.S.
We also believe our CpG 1018 adjuvant, which we use in our own products and product candidates and provide to our collaborators, is as or more effective than other available adjuvants and, being a yeast-derived product, is far more sustainable that other available products that are derived from, for example, shark squalene or tree bark. Regardless, there can be no guarantee that we can compete with other companies for sales of adjuvant, or any approved vaccine.
 Competition for HEPLISAV-B
HEPLISAV-B, a two-dose in one month adult hepatitis B vaccine, competes directly with conventional three-dose over six months marketed vaccines Engerix-B from GSK, as well as Recombivax-HB marketed by Merck. There are also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis B vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in the EU and the U.S. In addition, HEPLISAV-B competes against Twinrix, a bivalent vaccine marketed by GSK for protection against hepatitis B and hepatitis A. A three dose HBV vaccine manufactured by VBI Vaccines Inc. (“VBI”) is approved in Israel and the U.S. While we believe that HEPLISAV-B competes very well with other approved vaccines available on the market, we are still a relatively new entrant and we face significant competition in our longer term goal to capture a majority of U.S. market share. While we may explore additional territories outside of the U.S. and the EU to market HEPLISAV-B, in doing so we will likely face competition from these or other products and competitors.
  Competition for our adjuvant supply supporting COVID-19 and our development pipeline including pertussis, shingles and other potential pipeline indications
We are also in competition with companies developing vaccines, and vaccine adjuvants, generally, including, among others, GSK, Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi S.A., Merck, Novartis International AG, Agenus, Inc., Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., Novavax, Inc., Medicago Inc., Valneva, AstraZeneca plc, Moderna, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and VBI.
Many of the entities developing or marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative agreements with large, established companies with access to capital. These entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, promotion, pricing, import, export, storage and distribution of biopharmaceuticals. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or foreign regulatory agency requirements may result in warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, additional reporting obligations and/or agency oversight, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and biologics additionally under the Public Health Service Act. The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceuticals may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
 •completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests and pre-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations; 
 •performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application or a biologics license application, NDA or BLA, depending on the nature of the product after completion of all pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product for the indication for use; 
 •a determination by the FDA to accept the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations for pharmaceuticals; and 
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. 
 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates, or those of our collaborators, will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
The results of pre-clinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the thirty-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice (“GCP”) regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.


Clinical Trials. For purposes of an NDA or BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
•Phase 1. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients. 
 •Phase 2. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers. 
 •Phase 4. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product after approval under a post-marketing commitment or post- marketing requirement. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved a product. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 The results of biologic development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. Applications also must contain extensive manufacturing and control information. Applications must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, eight months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer to ensure that the product can be reliably produced in compliance with cGMPs and will typically inspect certain clinical trial sites for compliance with GCP. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an application by issuing a Complete Response Letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Approval may occur with boxed warnings on product labeling or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, which limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information.
Other Regulatory Requirements. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review, payment of program user fees and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, import alert or possible civil or criminal penalties. The FDA may also require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval for that product.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet, including certain social media activities. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental application, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential administrative, civil and

criminal penalties, as well as damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results.
Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available pharmaceuticals for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. If our promotional activities, including any promotional activities that a contracted sales force may perform on our behalf, fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require corrective advertising or a recall or institute fines or civil fines, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.
Outside the United States, the ability of our partners and us to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and region to region.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws. As a pharmaceutical company, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights may be applicable to our business. We may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is defined as any remuneration, direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute may have been violated, and enforcement will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA"), among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to state that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or to have offered improper inducements to federal health care program beneficiaries to select a particular provider or supplier. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. In addition, where such activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and

regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our activities with physician customers, pharmacies, and patients, as well as our activities pursuant to partnerships with other companies and pursuant to contracts with contract research organizations, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
The federal criminal and civil false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, the ACA specified that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act has been the basis for numerous enforcement actions and settlements by pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies in connection with various alleged financial relationships with customers. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached substantial financial settlements in connection with allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws, as might violations of the federal physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark laws, which prohibit a physician from making a referral to certain designated health services with which the physician or the physician’s family member has a financial interest and prohibit submission of a claim for reimbursement pursuant to the prohibited referral. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including, without limitation, false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Separately, there are a number of other fraud and abuse laws that pharmaceutical manufacturers must be mindful of, particularly after a product candidate has been approved for marketing in the United States. For example, a federal criminal law enacted as part of, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. There are also federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws. We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and their respective implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors. In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, HITECH created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. State laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, we are required to comply with international personal data protection laws and regulations, particularly as the result of our operations in Düsseldorf, Germany.
Privacy and Security Laws. We are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including, in the United States, HIPAA and, in the EU and the European Economic Area ("EEA") the GDPR (Regulation 2016/679). New privacy rules are being enacted in the United States and globally, and existing ones are being expanded, updated and strengthened.
 Effective May 25, 2018, the EU implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current EU data protection law to non-EU entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal information of EU subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR implements more stringent operational requirements than its predecessor legislation.
Further, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled in July 2020 that the Privacy Shield, used by thousands of companies to transfer data between the EU and United States, was invalid and could no longer be used. In September 2020, Switzerland

concluded that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. Alternative transfer mechanisms may be used, including the standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”), while the authorities interpret the decisions and scope of the invalidated Privacy Shield, but the SCCs have also been called into question in the same ruling that invalidated Privacy Shield.
Additionally, Brexit took effect in January 2020, which will lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. While the Data Protection Act of 2018, that “implements” and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful in the long term under GDPR. With the expiry of the transition period on December 31, 2020, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, which has the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk. We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.
 Also, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches.
Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA") in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA.
 “Sunshine” and Marketing Disclosure Laws. There are an increasing number of federal and state “sunshine” laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Several states and local jurisdictions have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, register pharmaceutical sales representatives, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, a similar federal requirement, known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires manufacturers, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, to track and report annually to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership or investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. The federal government discloses the reported information on a publicly available website. Certain states, such as Massachusetts, also make the reported information publicly available. In addition, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed and comply with codes of conduct, transparency reporting, and other obligations. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities with respect to our products in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Government Price Reporting. For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the “additional rebate,” a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U). This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This “additional rebate” calculation can, in

some cases where price increase has been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100 percent of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny.
Penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exception and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities in the United States could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Moreover, state governmental agencies may propose or enact laws and regulations that extend or contradict federal requirements. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the state or federal laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, sunshine, government price reporting, and fraud laws may prove costly.
 Coverage and Reimbursement. Sales of any marketed product, in particular for HEPLISAV-B, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any marketed product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a market product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Impact of Healthcare Reform and Recent Public Scrutiny of Specialty Drug Pricing on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. In the United States and other potentially significant markets for our products, federal and state authorities as well as third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average net selling prices. Further, there is increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices by federal and state lawmakers and enforcement authorities. In addition, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States, which will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs (including a number of proposals pertaining to prescription drugs, specifically), improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, in Massachusetts, the MassHealth program has requested permission from the federal government to use commercial tools, such as a closed formulary, to negotiate more favorable rebate agreements from drug manufactures. There also has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. Such interest has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law.

The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, in California, effective January 1, 2019, drug companies must notify insurers and government regulators of certain price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for such increases.
In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the ACA. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business.
There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future.
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
 MANUFACTURING
 We rely on our facility in Düsseldorf, Germany and third parties to perform the multiple processes involved in manufacturing HEPLISAV-B and our product candidates, including the manufacturing of TLR agonists, antigens, and the formulation, fill and finish of the resultant products. As is common in our industry in light of FDA inspection and licensing

requirements for manufacturing sites, we have relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce products for clinical trials and conduct fill/finish operations. We also rely on a single supplier to produce our CpG 1018 adjuvant for HEPLISAV-B and for our collaborators, and have established an additional qualified supplier to produce CpG 1018 adjuvant for our collaboration partners. Switching suppliers, or bringing on additional suppliers, could be complicated and time consuming, but we generally seek to maintain inventory to help bridge any unexpected gap in supply. In order to help us successfully manufacture and commercialize HEPLISAV-B, we have secured long-term supply agreements with the key third-party suppliers and vendors for commercial supply of our component products and finished goods. We currently manufacture the HBsAg for HEPLISAV-B at our Dynavax GmbH facility.
COMMITMENT TO COMPLIANCE AND ENVIRONMENT
 We are committed to conducting our business in compliance with all applicable legal and ethical standards. In addition, we are committed to helping to protect the environment.
 Our Ethics and Compliance program includes our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”), which sets forth our expectations of all Dynavax employees globally that they conduct their business activities in a legal and ethical manner. The Code can be found on our website under the header “Investors” and within that under the header “Corporate Governance Documents.” We have a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, a Compliance Steering Committee and policies, procedures and training addressing specific aspects of our business, including advertising and promotion; engagements with healthcare providers; and regarding our business activities outside the United States to ensure they comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable anti-corruption laws. We certify on an annual basis to having a comprehensive compliance program that meets the standards set forth under California law. This certification, which sets forth all of the elements of our healthcare compliance program, can be found on our web-site.
 We also care about the environment. To that end, our headquarters is in a building certified as “Gold” level on the LEED Scorecard as set forth by the United States Green Building Committee. Additionally, we offer incentives to our employees to utilize public transit in order to reduce traffic congestion and pollution and there is a free shuttle from our building to public transportation. Access to our offices has been limited to essential workers since the beginning of the pandemic. We do not plan to have our headquarter-based employees return to our headquarters full-time once the pandemic subsides. This transition to a largely virtual environment further helps reduce congestion and pollution. Additionally, we have plans in 2022 to significantly reduce the size of our headquarters office space which will further reduce our carbon footprint. In addition, we have an active recycling program. We continue to consider other ways in which we can conduct our business in an environmentally friendly manner.
 We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. We do not expect that expenditures for compliance with environmental laws will have a material effect on our results of operations in the future.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 311 employees, comprised of 201 employees in the U.S., including 96 members of our field sales team located throughout the U.S., as well as 110 employees in our office and manufacturing facility in Düsseldorf, Germany. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees, including Masters degrees and Pharm.D., Ph.D., M.D. or J.D. degrees. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
Retention
 Our regrettable turnover rate for 2021 was 12.0% in the U.S. and less than 7.7% in Düsseldorf. As a vaccine-focused company, we face stiff competition to hire and retain our employees which is exacerbated by the current and intense global focus to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine, as market participants in the COVID-19 space grow their businesses and seek to do so by hiring professionals with vaccine experience in particular. The average tenure among our employees, is 5.6 years in Düsseldorf and 2.6 years in the U.S.
Development


Attracting and retaining top talent is key to the achievement of our strategic goals. The development and engagement of our employees is also a top priority of the human resources team, and in 2021, an additional 28 leaders and key contributors completed a leadership development program.
In 2021 we offered a diversity and inclusion program called Awareness & Understanding in Action to our U.S.-based employees. This program consisted of five modules facilitated by an external Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") consultant. Later in the year we implemented the following three global DEI Commitments:
•Fostering a culture where all employees are recognized and appreciated for the unique individuals they are and for their accomplishments in the workplace.
 •Providing education to our employees on the negative effects of unconscious bias.
•Building and sustaining a team filled with a diversity of personal experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives.
In 2021 we also partnered with certain non-profit organizations committed to addressing the impact of poverty and inequality in our communities and we added two additional paid days for our employees to volunteer in their communities each year.
 Response to the COVID-19 pandemic
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved to a virtual working model in the U.S. and through work-from-home and creative scheduling efforts, we continued to reduce the number of employees required to be onsite each day in our Düsseldorf manufacturing facility by approximately 50%. Also, in response to the pandemic we implemented a wellness mobile phone application for employees with free exercise, nutrition and other health related resources. We held several internal competitions among employees and rewarded employees for making healthy lifestyle choices. In the U.S. we implemented an additional mental health benefit providing greater access to resources and care for our employees and their family members.
 Compensation
 We also monitor our compensation programs closely and provide what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits for all our employees. Each of our employees participates in our equity programs.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Risks Related to our Business and Capital Requirements
 HEPLISAV-B has been launched in the United States, and approved in the European Union, and there is significant competition in these marketplaces. Since this is our first marketed product, the timing of uptake and distribution efforts are unpredictable and there is a risk that we may not achieve and sustain commercial success for HEPLISAV-B.
 We have established sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and commercialized HEPLISAV-B in the U.S. Successful commercialization of HEPLISAV-B in the U.S. or elsewhere will require significant resources and time and, while our personnel are experienced with respect to marketing of healthcare products, because HEPLISAV-B is our first marketed product, the potential uptake of the product in distribution and the timing for growth in sales, if any, is unpredictable and we may not be successful in commercializing HEPLISAV-B in the long term. Additionally, while we have received European approval for HEPLISAV-B and we entered a commercialization agreement for the marketing and distribution of HEPLISAV-B in Germany in May 2021, we have never launched a product in the European Union before and there can be no certainty that we will succeed in our European launch efforts. In particular, successful commercialization of HEPLISAV-B will require that we continue to negotiate and enter into contracts with wholesalers, distributors, group purchasing organizations, and other parties, and that we maintain those contractual relationships. There is a risk that we may fail to complete or maintain some or all of these important contracts on favorable terms or at all, or that in a potentially evolving reimbursement environment, our efforts may fail to overcome established competition at favorable pricing or at all.
 We converted our contracted U.S. field sales team into full-time employees in the second quarter of 2019. Before then we had not previously employed an in-house field sales team, and thus have limited experience in overseeing and managing an employed salesforce. In 2021 we significantly expanded our field sales force. It will take time for this expanded team to generate significant sales momentum, if it does so at all. In addition, retention of capable sales personnel may be more difficult as we focus on a single product offering and we must retain our salesforce in order for HEPLISAV-B to establish a commercial presence.
Moreover, we expect that significant resources will need to be invested in order to successfully market, sell and distribute HEPLISAV-B for use with diabetes patients, one of our targeted patient populations. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) recommend that all adults aged 19-59, including patients with diabetes, receive hepatitis B vaccinations, we are unable to predict how many of those patients may actually receive HEPLISAV-B.
In addition to the risks with employing and maintaining our own commercial capabilities and with contracting, other factors that may inhibit our efforts to successfully commercialize HEPLISAV-B include:
 •whether we are able to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;
 •whether we are able to access key health care providers to discuss HEPLISAV-B;
 •whether we can compete successfully as a relatively new entrant in established distribution channels for vaccine products; and
 •whether we will maintain sufficient financial resources to cover the costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining a capable sales and marketing organization and related commercial infrastructure.
 If we are not successful, we may be required to collaborate or partner HEPLISAV-B with a third-party pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with existing products. To the extent we collaborate or partner, the financial value will be shared with another party and we will need to establish and maintain a successful collaboration arrangement, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or in a timely manner in order to establish HEPLISAV-B in the market. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially in our control. In that event, our product revenues may be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly with the highest priority, and we may be required to reduce or eliminate much of our commercial infrastructure and personnel as a result of such collaboration or partnership.
 We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and are taking proactive efforts to protect the health and safety of our workforce, patients and healthcare professionals, and to continue our business operations and advance our goal of bringing important new vaccines to patients as rapidly as possible. We have implemented measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including a mandatory work-from-home policy for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. In the conduct of our business activities, we are also taking actions to protect the safety of patients and healthcare professionals. Our field-based personnel previously paused in-person customer interactions in healthcare settings and generally used electronic communication, such as emails, phone calls and video

conferences. We may be required to do again so in the future. Many healthcare and contracting professionals at hospitals and other medical institutions with whom our field-based personnel interact are working a greater proportion of their working schedule from home and are facing additional demands on their time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The different quality of electronic interactions as compared with in-person interactions, as well as the reduced quantity of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, may reduce the effectiveness of our sales personnel, our customers’ procurement activities, as well as those of our collaborators, which could negatively affect our product sales.
 In addition, due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, most medical centers initially restricted access to their facilities and focused on providing care to only the most severely affected patients beginning in March 2020. As states began phasing out these restrictions, medical centers began operating under limited capacity and strict social distancing rules. The overall impact has generally resulted in significantly reduced utilization of all adult vaccines (other than COVID-19 vaccines) since the end of the first quarter of 2020, including a reduction in the utilization of HEPLISAV-B. This reduced utilization has significantly impacted sales and is likely to continue to impact us until restrictions affecting us are lifted and the U.S. returns to more normal conditions. There can be no assurance of the timing or likelihood for adult vaccine utilization rates to return to pre-pandemic levels.
 Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the European Union through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Even though we have been granted a marketing authorization in the European Union for HEPLISAV-B, we have yet to obtain reimbursements and pricing approval in any European Union member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other European Union member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Any delay in being able to market our products in the European Union or elsewhere will adversely affect our business and financial condition.
 If we, or our partners, are not successful in setting our marketing, pricing and reimbursement strategies, recruiting and maintaining effective sales and marketing personnel or building and maintaining the infrastructure to support commercial operations in the U.S. and elsewhere, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing HEPLISAV-B, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.
Our business and operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the evolving and ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.
 Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, which was declared by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel and other restrictions in order to reduce the spread of the disease. In response to these public health directives and orders, we have implemented work-from-home policies for all employees, except those that need to be at work in order to perform critical responsibilities.
 The COVID-19 pandemic, and government measures taken in response, have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as significant reductions in business-related activities have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, and manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended. In accordance with guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO and local authorities, beginning in March 2020, most of our global workforce transitioned to working remotely and has continued to do so since. The principal purchasers of HEPLISAV-B, including independent hospitals and clinics, integrated delivery networks, public health clinics and prisons, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs and retail pharmacies, have all drastically curtailed their day-to-day activities and ceased allowing or significantly reduced access to their facilities for non-COVID-19 related business. Thus, our field sales and medical science employees have increased their use of telephone and web-based means to carry out their roles where necessary, which may not be as effective as being in-person.
 The overall impact has generally resulted in significantly reduced utilization of all adult vaccines, (other than COVID-19 vaccines), including HEPLISAV-B, since the end of the first quarter of 2020. This shift has significantly and adversely impacted our sales of HEPLISAV-B and our business and operating results since March 2020 and continues to pose a headwind for our HEPLISAV-B business. This reduced HEPLISAV-B utilization is likely to continue to impact us until restrictions affecting us are lifted, and the U.S. returns to more normal conditions.

We also cannot predict to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt demand for HEPLISAV-B, but the overall magnitude of the disruption to our business will depend, in part, on the length and ongoing severity of the restrictions, and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. Utilization rates for adult vaccines (other than COVID-19 vaccines) are well below pre-pandemic levels. Prolonged disruptions would likely materially and negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
If the effect of any quarantines, shelter-in-place, executive and similar government orders related to COVID-19 increase, they could impact personnel at our manufacturing facility in Germany and third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States or abroad. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain and distribute a consistent supply of HEPLISAV-B or CpG 1018 adjuvant sufficient to meet demand.
 The spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, has resulted in changes to our business and operations which has impacted our business and operations and may materially affect us economically in the future. While the potential economic impact, and the duration of such impact, brought by the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could also potentially result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and new variants of the virus continue to emerge. While some vaccines have been recently approved, it is not clear whether, which, or to what extent these vaccines will protect against current or future variants of the virus. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, our future sales of HEPLISAV-B, sales of CpG 1018 adjuvant and our total revenue will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration and severity of the outbreak including current and future variants, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing requirements and business closures in the United States and elsewhere, business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and elsewhere to contain and treat the disease. Accordingly, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations or the global economy as a whole. However, these impacts could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
In addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.
 As we continue to focus on the commercialization of our HEPLISAV-B vaccine and our CpG 1018 adjuvant, we may encounter difficulties in managing our commercial growth and expanding our operations successfully.
 As our commercial operations expand, we expect that we will also need to manage additional relationships with various third parties, including sole source suppliers, distributors, wholesalers and hospital customers. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on our organization, in particular on management. Our future financial performance and our ability to successfully commercialize our HEPLISAV-B vaccine and CpG 1018 adjuvant, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we may not be able to manage our growth efforts effectively, and hire, train, retain and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, or secure sufficient or timely supply from third party service and product providers, and our failure to accomplish any of these activities could prevent us from successfully growing or our company or maintaining the same level of commercial growth.
 As we plan for broader commercialization of our HEPLISAV-B vaccine and for expanded capacity to manufacture our CpG 1018 adjuvant, our financial commitments to increase supply capacity might outpace actual demand for our products.
 As we plan to scale up production capabilities for HEPLISAV-B as well as production capabilities for our CpG 1018 adjuvant, to support market share gains or potential vaccine collaborations in response to COVID-19 and other initiatives, we have been, and in the future will be, required to make significant financial commitments to reserve manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”). Under ordinary circumstances we would make these commitments close in time and with some level of certainty that we have customers making similar commitments to us. Because of long lead times on manufacturing, uncertainty about who will ultimately buy adjuvant from us and in what quantities, if any, as well as the need to book manufacturing capacity in advance, the financial commitments we make to our CMOs to support

manufacturing may not be recovered in its entirety, or at all, if our collaborators or customers do not ultimately purchase from us. Capacity reservation fees are generally not recoverable if we do not use the capacity we have reserved as a result of lower than expected demand, or otherwise. As a result, we could end up making financial commitments that we never recover if demand for the adjuvant or any other product does not materialize in the volumes we are expecting or at all.
 As we continue to grow as a commercial organization and enter into supply agreements with customers, those supply agreements will have obligations to deliver product that we are reliant upon third parties to manufacture on our behalf.
 As our commercial business begins to expand in connection with commercial sales of HEPLISAV-B and CpG 1018 adjuvant, the contracts we enter into with our customers will generally carry delivery obligations that require us to deliver product in certain quantities and meet certain quality thresholds, among other things, all within specified timeframes. If, for any reason, whether due to reliance on third-party manufacturers or otherwise, we are unable to deliver timely, compliant products to our customers in quantities that meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to lost revenue, contractual penalties, suits for damages, harm to our reputation or other problems that could materially and adversely affect our business.
 Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may adversely affect our stock price.
 A substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future may depend on sales of CpG 1018 adjuvant, which are difficult to predict. For example, as of December 31, 2021, we received advanced payments from certain of our customers to purchase specified quantities of CpG 1018 adjuvant which were recorded as deferred revenue until we deliver the adjuvant and meet all criteria to recognize revenue. In accordance with our stated revenue policy, we expect to record revenue for these contracts upon meeting all of the criteria for revenue recognition under Accounting Standards Codification 606, which includes, among other criteria, the transfer of control for CpG 1018 adjuvant to our customer. The occurrence and timing of such transfer of control can be difficult to predict, and the recognition of revenue can vary widely depending on timing of product deliveries and satisfaction of other obligations. We expect that our visibility into future revenue relating to sales of CpG 1018 adjuvant, including volumes, prices and timing, will continue to be limited and could result in significant, unexpected fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results.
 Numerous factors, many of which are outside our control, may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of CpG 1018 accounted for 85% of our overall revenue, and one CpG 1018 customer accounted for 42% of our revenue. If orders from our top customers or the number of CpG 1018 collaborations are reduced or discontinued, our revenue in future periods may materially decrease. Fluctuations in our operating results may make financial planning and forecasting difficult. In addition, these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. Similarly, our revenue or operating expenses in one period may be disproportionately higher or lower relative to the others. Accordingly, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and investors should not rely on any particular past results as an indication of our future performance. If such fluctuations occur or if our operating results deviate from our expectations or the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price may be adversely affected.
 We rely on our facility in Düsseldorf, Germany and third parties to supply materials or perform processes necessary to manufacture our products and our product candidates. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to produce the oligonucleotides we require for development and commercialization. Additionally, we have limited experience in manufacturing our products or product candidates in commercial quantities. With respect to HEPLISAV-B, we use a pre-filled syringe presentation of the vaccine and our ability to meet future demand will depend on our ability to manufacture or have manufactured sufficient supply in this presentation.
 We rely on our facility in Düsseldorf and third parties to perform the multiple processes involved in manufacturing HEPLISAV-B surface antigens, the combination of the oligonucleotide and the antigens, and formulation, fill and finish. The FDA approved our pre-filled presentation of HEPLISAV-B in 2018 and we expect such presentation will be the sole presentation for HEPLISAV-B going forward. We have limited experience in manufacturing and supplying this presentation and rely on a contract manufacturer to do so. Our contract manufacturer is the only approved provider that we have, and there can be no assurance that we or they can successfully manufacture sufficient quantities of pre-filled syringes in compliance with good manufacturing practice ("GMP") in order to meet market demand.
Historically, we have also relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce oligonucleotides for clinical trials and a single supplier to produce (i) our CpG 1018 adjuvant for HEPLISAV-B and for our collaborators and (ii) our pre-filled

syringe presentation. Recently, we qualified a second supplier to manufacture CpG 1018 adjuvant, but have a limited operating relationship with them. To date, we have manufactured only small quantities of oligonucleotides ourselves for development purposes. If we were unable to maintain our existing suppliers for CpG 1018 adjuvant, we would have to establish an alternate qualified manufacturing capability ourselves, which would result in significant additional operating costs and delays in manufacturing HEPLISAV-B, or CpG 1018 adjuvant, and developing and commercializing our and our collaborators’ product candidates. We or other third parties may not be able to produce product at a cost, quantity and quality that are available from our current third-party suppliers, or at all.
 In countries outside of the U.S., we may not be able to comply with ongoing and comparable foreign regulations, and our manufacturing process may be subject to delays, disruptions or quality control/quality assurance problems. Noncompliance with these regulations or other problems with our manufacturing process may limit or disrupt the commercialization of our products or our and our collaborators’ product candidates and could result in significant expense.
We have entered into collaborative relationships to develop vaccines utilizing our CpG 1018 adjuvant, including collaborations to develop vaccines for COVID-19. These collaborations may not be successful. If the combination of patents, trade secrets and other proprietary rights that we rely on to protect our intellectual property rights in CpG 1018 adjuvant or otherwise are inadequate, we may be unable to realize recurring commercial benefit from the development of any vaccines containing CpG 1018 adjuvant.
 As part of our business, we are working to develop our CpG 1018 adjuvant as a premier vaccine adjuvant through research collaborations and partnerships. Current collaborations are focused on adjuvanted vaccines for COVID-19, plague, Tdap, seasonal influenza, universal influenza and shingles. There are risks and uncertainties inherent in vaccine research and development, including the timing of completing vaccine development, the results of clinical trials, whether a vaccine will be approved for use, the extent of competition, government actions and whether a vaccine can be successfully manufactured and commercialized. As a result, these collaborative efforts may not be as successful as we expect, or at all.
In addition, our collaborators have primary responsibility for the development, conduct of clinical trials, and for seeking and obtaining regulatory approval of potential vaccines, including any potential vaccine for COVID-19 containing our adjuvant. We have limited or no control over our collaborators’ decisions, including the amount and timing of resources that any of these collaborators will dedicate to such activities. Our collaborators may not purchase as much adjuvant as we anticipate, and they may delay placing orders or delay taking certain deliveries under certain circumstances which can affect our revenue recognition. If a collaborator fails to conduct collaborative activities successfully, the development and commercialization of a vaccine could be delayed, and may not occur at all. For example, as of December 31, 2021, only two of our collaborators have received emergency use authorization from an applicable regulatory authority for any vaccine for COVID-19 containing our adjuvant. We have historically relied on a single supplier to produce our CpG 1018 adjuvant, and only recently have qualified an alternate supplier to produce the adjuvant with whom we have a limited operating relationship. If we were unable to maintain our existing suppliers for the adjuvant, we would have to establish and maintain an alternate qualified manufacturing capability, which would result in significant additional operating costs and delays in developing and commercializing any potential adjuvanted vaccines by our third-party collaborators. We or other third parties may not be able to produce sufficient adjuvant at a cost, quantity and quality similar to that available from our current third-party suppliers, or at all, and even if we are successful in adding an additional supplier, there is no guarantee such supplier will be able to manufacture compliant supplemental quantities sufficient to support commercial demand, to the extent it materializes, and in the timeframes required.
 Our adjuvant has no composition of matter patent protection. We have filed patent applications claiming compositions and methods of use of CpG 1018 adjuvant for COVID-19 and other vaccines. Such patents may or may not be allowed. In addition, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and other agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know-how related to CpG 1018 adjuvant. If we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce our proprietary rights relating to CpG 1018 adjuvant, we may be unable to realize recurring commercial benefit from the development of a vaccine containing CpG 1018 adjuvant, and we may not have the ability to prevent others from developing or commercializing a vaccine containing the adjuvant. Disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators (with us and/or with one or more third parties), including disputes over ownership rights to intellectual property, know-how or technologies developed with our collaborators.
 Furthermore, restrictive government actions related to potential waivers of intellectual property rights in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, such as imposition of compulsory licenses related to COVID-19 vaccines, as well as other regulatory initiatives, may result in a general weakening of our or our collaborators’ intellectual property protection or otherwise diminish or eliminate our or our collaborators’ ability to realize any commercial benefit from the

development of a COVID-19 vaccine containing CpG 1018. This may, in turn, adversely impact the demand for CpG 1018, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 We face uncertainty regarding coverage, pricing and reimbursement and the practices of third-party payors, which may make it difficult or impossible to sell certain of our products or product candidates on commercially reasonable terms.
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on the negotiation of a favorable price, as well as the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement, from third-party payors, in particular for HEPLISAV-B, where existing products are already marketed. In the U.S., pricing for hepatitis B vaccines is currently stable and reimbursement is favorable as we believe private and public payors recognize the value of prophylaxis in this setting given the high costs of potential morbidity and mortality, and we have achieved coverage with most third-party payors. However, there is a risk that some payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include HEPLISAV-B. Thus, there can be no assurance that HEPLISAV-B will achieve and sustain stable pricing and favorable reimbursement. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Our ability to successfully obtain and retain market share and achieve and sustain profitability will be significantly dependent on the market’s acceptance of a price for HEPLSIAV-B sufficient to achieve profitability, and future acceptance of such pricing.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and pricing, as well as coverage and reimbursement decisions, may not allow our future products to compete effectively with existing competitive products. Because we intend to offer products, if approved, that involve new technologies and new approaches to treating disease, the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse for our products is uncertain. We will have to charge a price for our products that is sufficient to enable us to recover our considerable investment in product development and our operating costs. Further, coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to achieve profitability, and such unavailability could harm our future prospects and reduce our stock price.
 We have applied for, and in some cases have received, grants to help fund the scale-up of CpG 1018 production, and such grants, if and when received, may involve pricing or other restrictions.
 In order to help fund potential scale-up of production of CpG 1018 adjuvant that may be required in the event that our CpG 1018 adjuvant is included in any approved and commercially-available novel vaccine, whether a COVID-19 vaccine or otherwise, we have applied for, and in some cases have received grants from various charitable and philanthropic organizations. We may seek such grants in the future. These grants and others, if and when received, may come with certain pricing requirements, global access requirements or reporting or other covenants to ensure that any funded product is made available by us worldwide and on a nondiscriminatory basis. Such covenants may limit the price we can charge for any funded product and may involve a license to use technology we own that is included in the funded products if we do not comply. Such price limitations or licenses, if invoked, could serve to limit the prices we charge, or our control over the manufacturing and distribution of grant-funded products. Failure to agree with such requirements, may result in us not receiving some or all of the grant.
 We are subject to ongoing FDA and EMA post-marketing obligations concerning HEPLISAV-B, which may result in significant additional expense, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated regulatory issues with HEPLISAV-B.
 Our HEPLISAV-B regulatory approval in the United States is subject to certain post-marketing obligations and commitments to the FDA. For example, we were required to conduct an observational comparative study of HEPLISAV-B to Engerix-B to assess occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, or AMI. This study was initiated in August 2018, concluded in November 2020 and the final study report has been submitted to the FDA. We are also committed to conducting an observational surveillance study to evaluate the incidence of new onset immune-mediated diseases, herpes zoster and anaphylaxis; and we are required to establish a pregnancy registry to provide information on outcomes following pregnancy exposure to HEPLISAV-B. These studies will require significant effort and resources, and failure to timely conduct and/or complete these studies to the satisfaction of the FDA could result in withdrawal of our BLA approval, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The results of post-marketing studies may also result in additional warnings or precautions for the HEPLISAV-B label or expose additional safety concerns

that may result in product liability and withdrawal of the product from the market, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Similar post-marketing obligations and commitments exist in the European Union. For example, we are required to submit periodic safety update reports to the EMA and to keep an up to date risk management plan that takes into account new information that may lead to a significant change in the risk/benefit profile of HEPISLAV-B. Non-compliance with European Union requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance can result in significant financial penalties.
 In addition, the manufacturing processes, labelling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for HEPLISAV-B are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements in the United States and the European Union. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), good clinical practices (“GCP”), ICH guidelines, and good laboratory practices (“GLP”). If we are not able to meet and maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose marketing approval and be required to withdraw our product. Withdrawal of our product would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 If HEPLISAV-B or any products we develop are not accepted by the market or if regulatory agencies limit our labeling indications, require labeling content that diminishes market uptake of HEPLISAV-B or any other products we develop, or limit our marketing claims, we may be unable to generate significant revenues, if any.
 Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, such as the U.S. and European approvals of HEPLISAV-B and are able to commercialize them as we have with HEPLISAV-B, our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community.
 The degree of market acceptance of HEPLISAV-B and any of our future approved products will depend upon a number of factors, including:
 •the indication for which the product is approved and its approved labeling;
 •the presence of other competing approved therapies;
 •the potential advantages of the product over existing and future treatment methods;
 •the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product;
 •the strength of our sales, marketing and distribution support;
 •the price and cost-effectiveness of the product; and
 •third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement and the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of sufficient reimbursement by third-party payors. 
 The FDA or other regulatory agencies could limit the labeling indication for which our product candidates may be marketed or could otherwise limit marketing efforts for our products. If we are unable to achieve approval or successfully market any of our product candidates, or marketing efforts are restricted by regulatory limits, our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired.
 Many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise than we do. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing or potential competitors as a result of these disadvantages, we may be unable to generate sufficient, or any, revenues and our business will be harmed.
 We compete with pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and research organizations, in developing and marketing vaccines and adjuvants. For example, HEPLISAV-B competes in the U.S. with established hepatitis B vaccines marketed by Merck and GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) and, if commercialized outside the U.S., with vaccines from those companies as well as several additional established pharmaceutical companies who market abroad. There are also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis B vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in the European Union and United States. In addition, HEPLISAV-B competes against Twinrix, a bivalent vaccine marketed by GSK for protection against hepatitis B and hepatitis A. A three-dose HBV vaccine manufactured by VBI Vaccines Inc. (“VBI”) is approved in Israel and U.S.


We are also in competition with companies developing vaccines and vaccine adjuvants, generally including, among others, GSK, Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi S.A., Merck, Novartis International AG, Agenus, Inc., Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., Novavax, Inc., Medicago Inc., Valneva, AstraZeneca plc, Moderna, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and VBI. We will likely compete with several of these companies in the hepatitis space, Tdap space, shingles space and spaces occupied by any other product candidates we ultimately choose to advance through our pipeline in the future.
Products in our clinical pipeline, if approved, will also face competition from competitors who have competing clinical programs or already approved products. Existing and potential competitors or other market participants may also compete with us for qualified commercial, scientific and management personnel, as well as for technology that would otherwise be advantageous to our business. Our success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the near-term, particularly with respect to HEPLISAV-B commercialization. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our operations may suffer and we may be unable to obtain financing as needed, enter into collaborative arrangements, sell our product candidates or generate revenues.
 Despite recent profitability, we have incurred annual net losses in each year since our inception and anticipate that we could continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future unless we can successfully commercialize HEPLISAV-B and/or continue to sell significant quantities of our CpG 1018 adjuvant, and if we are unable to sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.
 We have generated limited revenue from the sale of products and, prior to January 1, 2021, have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations in 1996. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $76.7 million compared to net loss of $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion.
With our investment in the launch and commercialization of HEPLISAV-B in the U.S., we have in the past, and could in the future, incur operating losses. Our expenses have increased substantially as we established and maintain our HEPLISAV-B commercial infrastructure, including investments in internal infrastructure to support our field sales force and investments in manufacturing and supply chain commitments to maintain commercial supply of HEPLISAV-B. While new sales of CpG 1018 adjuvant have generated significant revenue during the pandemic, there is no guarantee that such revenues will be sustainable in the long term. The timing for uptake of our products in the U.S. and abroad may further affect costs or losses related to commercialization. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing vaccine products or other products we may choose to offer in the future, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, if ever, we will become profitable on an annual basis, or, that if we are able to reach consistent profitability that it will be sustainable for any period of time.
Until we are able to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability through product sales on a consistent basis, we may require substantial additional capital to finance our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $546.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Prior to January 1, 2021, we incurred net losses in each year since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of $76.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion. We cannot be certain that sales of our products, and the revenue from our other activities are sustainable and past results are not a reliable indicator of future performance. Further, we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses as we continue to invest in the commercialization and development of HEPLISAV-B and our CpG 1018 adjuvant, clinical trials for our pipeline candidates, and other development. If we cannot generate a sufficient amount of revenue from product sales, we will need to finance our operations through strategic alliance and licensing arrangements and/or future public or private debt and equity financings. Raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations, or both. In addition, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could include covenants that would restrict our operations.
 Our ability to raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets, should we choose to do so, is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common stock, which itself is subject to a number of development and business risks and uncertainties, our creditworthiness and the uncertainty that we would be able to raise such additional capital at a price or on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by deteriorating global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Adequate financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed,

we may need to significantly reduce our operations while we seek strategic alternatives, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives.
Regulatory authorities may require more clinical trials for our product candidates than we currently expect or are conducting before granting regulatory approval, if regulatory approval is granted at all. Our clinical trials may be extended which may lead to substantial delays in the regulatory approval process for our product candidates and may impair our ability to generate revenues.
 Our registration and commercial timelines depend on further discussions with regulatory agencies and requirements and any requests that they may make for additional data or completion of additional clinical trials. Any such requirements or requests could:
 •adversely affect our ability to timely and successfully commercialize or market these product candidates;
 •result in significant additional costs;
 •potentially diminish any competitive advantages for those products;
 •potentially limit the markets for those products;
 •adversely affect our ability to enter into collaborations or receive milestone payments or royalties from potential collaborators;
 •cause us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate; or
 •limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 We may develop, seek regulatory approval for and market HEPLISAV-B or any other product candidates outside of the U.S. and Europe, requiring a significant commitment of resources. Failure to successfully manage our international operations could result in significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our products or product candidates.
 We may seek to introduce HEPLISAV-B, or any other product candidates we may develop, to various additional markets outside of the U.S. and Europe. Developing, seeking regulatory approval for and marketing our product candidates outside of the U.S. could impose substantial costs, as well as burdens on our personnel resources, in addition to potential diversion of management’s attention from domestic operations. International operations are subject to risk, including:
 •the difficulty of managing geographically distant operations, including recruiting and retaining qualified employees, locating adequate facilities and establishing useful business support relationships in the local community;
 •compliance with varying international regulatory requirements, laws and treaties;
 •securing international distribution, marketing and sales capabilities upon favorable terms;
 •adequate protection of our intellectual property rights;
 •obtaining regulatory and pricing approvals at a level sufficient to justify commercialization;
 •legal uncertainties and potential timing delays associated with tariffs, export licenses and other trade barriers;
 •foreign tax compliance and diverse tax consequences;
 •the fluctuation of conversion rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar; and
 •regional and geopolitical risks.
 In the event that we determine to pursue commercialization of HEPLISAV-B outside the United States and the European Union, our opportunity will depend upon our receiving regulatory approval, which can be costly and time consuming, and there is a risk that one or more regulatory bodies may require that we conduct additional clinical trials and/or take other measures which will take time and require that we incur significant additional expense. In addition, there is the risk that we may not receive approval in one or more jurisdictions, even if we undertake these efforts.
 The results of clinical trials conducted to support regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, and any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval

process in other jurisdictions, including our regulatory approval in the United States. If we are unable to successfully manage our international operations, we may incur significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues.
 Clinical trials for our commercial product and product candidates are expensive and time consuming, may take longer than we expect or may not be completed at all, and have uncertain outcomes.
 Clinical trials, including post-marketing studies, to generate sufficient data to meet FDA (and other regulatory agency) requirements are expensive and time consuming, may take more time to complete than expected or may not be completed, and may not have favorable outcomes if they are completed. In addition, results from smaller, earlier stage clinical studies may not be representative of larger, controlled clinical trials that would be required in order to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate.
 Each of our clinical trials requires the investment of substantial planning, expense and time and the timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of these clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling participants who meet trial eligibility criteria, failure of participants to complete the clinical trial, delay or failure to obtain Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or regulatory approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, unexpected adverse events and shortages of available drug supply. Participant enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the relevant population, the proximity of participants to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments.
 As a biopharmaceutical company, we engage clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to conduct clinical studies, and failure by us or our CROs to conduct a clinical study in accordance with GCP standards and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disqualification of the applicable clinical trial from consideration in support of approval of a potential product.
 We are responsible for conducting our clinical trials consistent with GCP standards and for oversight of our vendors to ensure that they comply with such standards. We depend on medical institutions and CROs to conduct our clinical trials in compliance with GCP. To the extent that we or they fail to comply with GCP standards, fail to enroll participants for our clinical trials, or are delayed for a significant time in the execution of our trials, including achieving full enrollment, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both, which may harm our business.
 Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA or other applicable foreign government guidelines and are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of our product candidates produced under GMP and other requirements in foreign countries, and may require large numbers of participants.
 In addition, we obtain guidance from regulatory authorities on certain aspects of our clinical development activities and seek to comply with written guidelines provided by the authorities. These discussions and written guidelines are not binding obligations on the part of the regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities may require additional patient data or studies to be conducted. Regulatory authorities may revise or retract previous guidance during the course of a clinical trial or after completion of the trial. The authorities may also disqualify a clinical trial from consideration in support of approval of a potential product if they deem the guidelines have not been met. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may determine our clinical trials or other data regarding safety, efficacy or consistency of manufacture or compliance with GMP regulations are insufficient for regulatory approval.
 The FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies or we ourselves could delay, suspend or halt our clinical trials of a product candidate for numerous reasons, including with respect to our product candidates and those of our partners in combination agent studies:
 •deficiencies in the trial design;
 •deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trial including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;
 •deficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;
 •a product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects, including fatalities, or a determination may be made that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;


•the time required to determine whether a product candidate is effective may be longer than expected;
 •fatalities or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial that may not be related to clinical trial treatments;
 •a product candidate or combination study may appear to be no more effective than current therapies;
 •the quality or stability of a product candidate may fail to conform to acceptable standards;
 •the inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of a product candidate to complete the trials;
 •our inability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;
 •our inability to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;
 •the inability to obtain regulatory approval to conduct a clinical trial;
 •lack of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial, including the occurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;
 •the inability to recruit and enroll individuals to participate in clinical trials for reasons including competition from other clinical trial programs for the same or similar indications; or
 •the inability to retain participants who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are otherwise unavailable for further follow-up.
 In addition, we may experience significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials, such as unexpected adverse events that occur when our product candidates are combined with other therapies and drugs or given to larger patient populations, which often occur in later-stage clinical trials, or less favorable clinical outcomes. Moreover, clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals.
Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events, including participant fatalities that may be attributable to our product candidates, during a clinical trial may necessitate that it be redesigned, repeated or terminated. Further, some of our clinical trials may be overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”), and the DSMB may determine to delay or suspend one or more of these trials due to safety or futility findings based on events occurring during a clinical trial. Any such delay, suspension, termination or request to repeat or redesign a trial could increase our costs and prevent or significantly delay our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Even if we complete all such activities without issue, final results may not actually support approval of a particular product candidate.
 HEPLISAV-B and most of our earlier stage programs rely on oligonucleotide TLR agonists. In the event of serious adverse event data relating to TLR agonists we may be required to reduce the scope of, or discontinue, our operations, or reevaluate the viability of strategic alternatives.
 Most of our programs, including HEPLISAV-B, incorporate TLR9 agonist CpG oligonucleotides. If any of our product candidates in clinical trials or similar products from competitors produce serious adverse event data, we may be required to delay, discontinue or modify our clinical trials or our clinical trial strategy, or significantly reevaluate strategic alternatives. If a safety risk based on mechanism of action or the molecular structure were identified, it may hinder our ability to develop our product candidates or enter into potential collaboration or commercial arrangements. Rare diseases and a numerical imbalance in cardiac adverse events have been observed in patients in our clinical trials. If adverse event data are found to apply to our TLR agonist and/or inhibitor technology as a whole, we may be required to significantly reduce or discontinue our operations.
 HEPLISAV-B is subject to regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, and if we receive regulatory approval for our other product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing FDA and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review for such products.
 With respect to HEPLISAV-B and our other product candidates in development, we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with applicable GMP regulations and other international regulatory requirements. The regulations require that our products and product candidates be manufactured and records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and quality control/quality assurance activities. Manufacturers and suppliers of key components and materials must be named in a BLA submitted to the FDA for any product candidate for which we are

seeking FDA approval. Additionally, third-party manufacturers and suppliers and any manufacturing facility must undergo a pre-approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates. Even after a manufacturer has been qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the FDA following initial approval. Further, to the extent that we contract with third parties for the manufacture of our products or product candidates, our ability to control third-party compliance with FDA requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection.
If, as a result of the FDA’s inspections, it determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may not approve the product or may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the suppliers for our products or product candidates are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we might be unable to ship our approved product for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. Significant and costly delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required.
 Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may also result in warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution, any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and to our stock price.
 Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post-marketing follow-up studies, which may be costly. Product approvals, once granted, may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or commercial use. As a result, limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims, or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after approval and commercialization.
 A key part of our business strategy for products in development is to establish collaborative relationships to help fund or manage development and commercialization of our product candidates and research programs. We may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit our ability to continue to develop and commercialize those products and programs, if at all.
 We have and may in the future need to establish collaborative relationships to obtain domestic and/or international sales, marketing, research, development and distribution capabilities for our product candidates and our discovery research programs. Failure to obtain a collaborative relationship for those product candidates and programs or HEPLISAV-B in markets outside the U.S. requiring extensive sales efforts, may significantly impair the potential for those products and programs and we may be required to raise additional capital to continue them. The process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and time-consuming, and even if we establish such relationships, they may involve significant uncertainty, including:
 •our partners may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results, manufacturing issues, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons;
 •our shortage of capital resources may impact the willingness of companies to collaborate with us; 
 •our contracts for collaborative arrangements are terminable at will on written notice and may otherwise expire or terminate and we may not have alternative funding available;
 •our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies, including those of our competitors;
 •we may have disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration;
 •we have limited control over the decisions of our partners and they may change the priority of our programs in a manner that would result in termination of the agreement or add significant delay in the partnered program;
 •our ability to generate future payments and royalties from our partners depends upon the abilities of our partners to establish the safety and efficacy of product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and commercialize the products developed from product candidates; 
 •we or our partners may fail to properly initiate, maintain or defend our intellectual property rights, where applicable, or a party may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;


•our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our product candidates; and
 •our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements.
 Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into one or more collaboration agreements, collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we may have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we do over our proprietary development and commercialization programs, and the financial terms upon which collaborators may be willing to enter into such an arrangement cannot be certain.
If any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, our research, clinical development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts pursuant to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated, or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to secure collaborative arrangements. If we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital.
We rely on CROs and clinical sites and investigators for our clinical trials. If these third parties do not fulfill their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines, our planned clinical trials may be delayed and we may fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates.
 We rely on CROs, clinical sites and investigators for our clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or meet expected deadlines our planned clinical trials may be extended, delayed, modified or terminated. While we maintain oversight over our clinical trials and conduct regular reviews of the data, we are dependent on the processes and quality control efforts of our third-party contractors to ensure that clinical trials are conducted properly and that detailed, quality records are maintained to support the results of the clinical trials that they are conducting on our behalf. Any extension, delay, modification or termination of our clinical trials or failure to ensure adequate documentation and the quality of the results in the clinical trials could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
 If we fail to comply with the extensive requirements applicable to biopharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers under the healthcare fraud and abuse, anticorruption, privacy, transparency and other laws of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, we may be subject to significant liability.
 Our activities, and the activities of our agents, including some contracted third parties, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Our interactions with physicians and others in a position to prescribe or purchase our products are subject to a legal regime designed to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse and off-label promotion. We also are subject to laws pertaining to transparency of transfers of value to healthcare providers; privacy and data protection; compliance with industry voluntary compliance guidelines; and prohibiting the payment of bribes. Relevant U.S. laws include:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
 •federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the government or its agents that are false or fraudulent;
 •the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and governing regulations which, among other things, prohibit off-label promotion of prescription drugs;
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”) which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members; 


•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created, among other things, new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and requires that a company’s books and records accurately reflect the company’s transactions; and
 •foreign and state law equivalents of each of the federal laws described above, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by state health insurance programs or any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 The Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, states’ Attorneys General and other governmental authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations discussed above. These entities also coordinate extensively with the FDA, using legal theories that connect violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (such as off-label promotion) to the eventual submission of false claims to government healthcare programs. Prosecution of such promotion cases under the False Claims Act provides the potential for private parties (qui tam relators, or “whistleblowers”) to initiate cases on behalf of the government and provides for significantly higher penalties upon conviction.
 In the U.S., pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of numerous government prosecutions and investigations alleging violations of law, including claims asserting impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, or submission of incorrect pricing information.
 Violations of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations and other similar foreign laws may subject us, our employees or our agents to significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including fines, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in government health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the restriction or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Additionally, whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct may cause us to incur significant expense, cause reputational damage, divert management time and attention, and otherwise adversely affect our business. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, contractors, or other agents are or will be in compliance with all applicable U.S. or foreign laws.
 It remains unclear how various state, federal, and international privacy and cybersecurity law will affect our business. For example, we don’t know how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. As we expand our operations, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws.
Internationally, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, will require the appointment of data protection officers when sensitive personal data, such as health data, is processed on a large scale, provides more robust rights for data subjects, introduces mandatory data breach notification through the EU, imposes additional obligations on us when contracting with service providers and requires us to

adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, training and data audit. If we do not comply with our obligations under the GDPR, we could be exposed to fines of up to the greater of €20 million or up to 4% of our total global annual revenue in the event of a significant breach. In addition, we may be the subject of litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, mechanisms for legally transferring information under the GDPR remain unclear. At present, there are few if any viable alternatives to the standard contractual clauses, or SCCs, so future developments may necessitate further expenditures on local infrastructure, changes to internal business processes, or may otherwise affect or restrict sales and operations.
 Enacted or future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may have an adverse effect on our operations and business.
 We expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and/or regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our operations and business. For example, the ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. There have been executive, legal and political challenges to certain aspects of ACA. For example, President Trump signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January l, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA”) among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and will remain open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and healthcare reform measures will impact the ACA and our business.
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently in the U.S. over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For

example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation Model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, and restrictions on certain product access. In some cases, such legislation and regulations have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or the effect any such initiatives may have on our business. However, in the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of products, including our product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 In connection with our work with the U.S. Department of Defense, we have become a defense contractor, and are therefore subject to new administrative burdens and control requirements in connection with the maintenance of that relationship.
 In September of 2021, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") relating to the conduct of a clinical trial in connection with the development of an improved plague vaccine. In connection with this agreement we became subject to new administrative and control requirements, including certain reporting obligations as well as a requirement to develop, implement and maintain an ITAR compliance program, among other things. Further, if our efforts result in an improved plague vaccine and we enter into a supply agreement for finished plague vaccines with the DoD, we expect that such a supply contract would impose additional administrative, control, compliance and other obligations. We have limited experience developing and administering such programs. Development and maintenance of such programs can be burdensome and costly and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with all of the terms of such an agreement. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a significant reputational or financial impact on our business and on our stock price.
We face product liability exposure, which, if not covered by insurance, could result in significant financial liability.
 While we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products, including HEPLISAV-B, will subject us to potential product liability claims and may raise questions about a product’s safety and efficacy. As a result, we could experience a delay in our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates or reduced sales of any approved product candidates. In addition, a product liability claim may exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources. We have obtained limited clinical trial liability and umbrella insurance coverage for our clinical trials. This coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts, at an acceptable cost, or at all. While we have obtained product liability insurance coverage for HEPLISAV-B, there is a risk that this coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts, at an acceptable cost or at all. We also may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing in the future. A product liability claim, product recalls or

other claims, as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, would divert our management’s attention from our business and could result in significant financial liability.
 Risks Related to our Intellectual Property
 If third parties successfully assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge our patents and proprietary rights, we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly, time consuming and delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates.
 We may be exposed to future litigation or other dispute by third parties based on claims that our products, product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights, or we may be required to enter into litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the ownership, scope or validity of our or another party’s proprietary rights, including a challenge as to the validity of our issued and pending claims. From time to time we have been, and in the future may become, involved in various administrative proceedings related to our intellectual property which causes us to incur certain legal expenses. If we become involved in any litigation and/or other significant proceedings related to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others, we will incur substantial additional expenses and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.
 If we or our collaborators are unsuccessful in defending or prosecuting our issued and pending claims or in defending potential claims against our products, for example, as may arise in connection with the commercialization of HEPLISAV-B or any similar or other product candidate, we or our collaborator could be required to pay substantial damages or be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies without a license from such third party. A license may require the payment of substantial fees or royalties, require a grant of a cross-license to our technology or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any of these outcomes could require us to change our business strategy and could materially impact our business and operations.
 If the combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate, the value of our products or product candidates will decrease, and we may be unable to realize any commercial benefit from the development of a vaccine containing our CpG 1018 adjuvant.
 Our success depends on our ability to:
 •obtain and protect commercially valuable patents or the rights to patents both domestically and abroad;
 •operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others; and
 •prevent others from successfully challenging or infringing our proprietary rights.
 We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use only to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents for a commercially sufficient term or are otherwise effectively maintained as trade secrets. We try to protect our proprietary rights by filing and prosecuting U.S. and foreign patent applications. However, in certain cases such protection may be limited, depending in part on existing patents held by third parties, or other disclosures which impact patentability, which may only allow us to obtain relatively narrow patent protection. In the U.S., legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biopharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain, are still evolving and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved.
 For example, our HEPLISAV-B and CpG 1018 adjuvant have no composition of matter patent protection in the United States or elsewhere. We must therefore rely primarily on the protection afforded by method of use patents relating to HEPLISAV-B and the use of CpG 1018 in vaccines, and trade secret protection and confidentiality and other agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know-how related to HEPLISAV-B and CpG 1018. We have three issued U.S. patents relating to certain uses of HEPLISAV-B that expire in 2032. We have filed patent applications claiming compositions and methods of use of CpG 1018 for COVID-19 and other vaccines, but we cannot provide any assurances that we will receive an issued patent for any of these patent applications or that, if issued, any of these patents will provide adequate protection for any intended use of CpG 1018 in vaccines. In addition, we may be subject to co-ownership of the underlying intellectual property with our collaborators and not the sole owner. If we are unable to adequately obtain patent protection or enforce our other proprietary rights relating to CpG 1018, we may be unable to realize any recurring commercial benefit from the development of a vaccine containing CpG 1018, and we may not have the ability to prevent others from developing or commercializing a vaccine containing CpG 1018.


The biopharmaceutical patent environment outside the U.S. is also uncertain. We may be particularly affected by this uncertainty since several of our product candidates or our collaborators’ vaccine candidates may initially address market opportunities outside the U.S., where we may only be able to obtain limited patent protection, if any at all. For example, while many countries such as the U.S. permit method of use patents relating to the use of drug products, in some countries the law relating to patentability of such use claims is evolving, or may prohibit certain activities, and may be unfavorably interpreted to prevent us from successfully prosecuting some or all of our pending patent applications relating to the use of CpG 1018. There are some countries that currently do not allow such method of use patents, or that significantly limit the types of uses that are patentable.
 The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following:
 •we may not receive an issued patent for any of our patent applications or for any patent applications that we have exclusively licensed now or in the future;
 •the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;
 •the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection or may not be valid or enforceable;
 •we might not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;
 •the patents licensed or issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a competitive advantage;
 •patents issued to other parties may limit our intellectual property protection or harm our ability to do business;
 •other parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we attempt to patent; 
 •other parties may design around technologies we have licensed, patented or developed; and
 •pending patent applications or issued patents may be challenged by third parties in proceedings, such as inter partes review, pre- and post-grant oppositions, and post grant review.
 We also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know-how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary know-how adequately. Any disclosure of confidential data in the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets. If we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce proprietary rights, we may be unable to commercialize our products, enter into collaborations, generate revenues or maintain any advantage we may have with respect to existing or potential competitors.
 We have in the past, and may in the future, rely on licenses to intellectual property from third parties. Impairment of these licenses or our inability to obtain or maintain them could severely harm our business.
 Our current or future research and development efforts may depend in part upon our license arrangements for certain intellectual property owned by third parties. Our dependence on these licenses could subject us to numerous risks, such as disputes regarding the use of the licensed intellectual property and the creation and ownership of new discoveries under such license agreements. In addition, these license arrangements could require us to make timely payments to maintain our licenses and typically contain diligence or milestone-based termination provisions. Our failure to meet any obligations pursuant to such agreements could allow licensors to terminate our agreements or undertake other remedies such as converting exclusive to non-exclusive licenses if we are unable to cure or obtain waivers for such failures or amend such agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, license agreements may be terminated or may expire by their terms, and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licenses. If we cannot obtain and maintain licenses that are advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our product candidates, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license similar technology or to find other alternatives to maintaining the competitive position of our products. If such alternatives are not available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, we may be unable to develop or commercialize certain of our product candidates. In the absence of a current license, we may be required to redesign our technology so it does not infringe a third-party’s patents, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.


Risks Related to our Common Stock
 Our stock price is subject to volatility, and your investment may suffer a decline in value.
 The market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been, and are likely to continue in the future, to be, very volatile. The market price of our common stock is subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
 •impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HEPLISAV-B vaccine, CpG 1018 adjuvant, or other product revenue;
 •progress or results of any of our clinical trials or regulatory or manufacturing efforts, in particular any announcements regarding the progress or results of our planned trials and BLA filing and communications, from the FDA or other regulatory agencies;
 •our ability to receive timely regulatory approval for our product candidates;
 •our ability to establish and maintain collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;
 •our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations;
 •technological innovations, new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors;
 •changes in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our products or product candidates;
 •our ability to obtain component materials and successfully enter into manufacturing relationships for our products or product candidates or establish manufacturing capacity on our own;
 •our ability to establish and maintain licensing agreements for intellectual property necessary for the development of our product candidates;
 •changes in government regulations, general economic conditions or industry announcements;
 •changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;
 •issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations;
 •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results; 
 •the volume of trading in our common stock;
 •investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance; and
 •industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability, as well as developments with respect to the COVID-19 global pandemic, including but not limited to regulatory initiatives, such as the imposition of compulsory licenses related to COVID-19 vaccines, that may result in a general weakening of intellectual property protections.
 The stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have historically experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies, including recently in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased market prices, notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in the underlying business models or prospects of those companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In this regard, worsening economic conditions, interest rate increases and/or other tapering policies from the government, and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or general economic environment may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
 One or more of these factors could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock. In addition, securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. We have in the past been, and we may in the future be, the target of such litigation. Securities and shareholder derivative litigation could result in substantial costs, and divert management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.


Future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
Under our universal shelf registration statement, we may sell any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings, including pursuant to our sales agreement with Cowen & Company, LLC, under which we can offer and sell our common stock from time to time up to aggregate sales proceeds of $150 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had $120.5 million remaining under our sales agreement with Cowen & Company, LLC. The sale or issuance of our securities, including those issuable upon exercise of the outstanding warrants or conversion of the preferred stock, as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities.
 Risks Related to Our Outstanding Convertible Notes
 Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the $225.5 million in 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2026 (“Convertible Notes”), depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.
 We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.
 Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Convertible Notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the occurrence of a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes could constitute an event of default under any agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.
 The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.


As of October 1, 2021, the conditions allowing holders to convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes were met, and holders of Convertible Notes are entitled to convert their Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
 Conversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
 The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes to shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. As of October 1, 2021, the conditions allowing holders to convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes were met. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
 Certain provisions in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.
 Certain provisions in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture governing the Convertible Notes will require us, subject to certain exceptions, to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Convertible Notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.
 The Capped Calls may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.
 In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we have entered into capped call transactions with the option counterparties totaling $27.2 million (the "Capped Calls"). The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock as a result of any conversion of the Convertible Notes, subject to a cap based on the cap price.
In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Calls, we have been advised that the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes and/or purchased shares of our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the Capped Calls, which are expected to occur during the 30 trading day period beginning on the 31st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, or following any termination of any portion of the Capped Calls in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes.
 General Risk Factors
 The loss of key personnel could delay or prevent achieving our objectives. In addition, our continued growth to support commercialization may result in difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.


We depend on our senior executive officers, as well as other key scientific personnel. Our commercial and business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key members of our commercial or management staff, including our senior executive officers. We currently have no key person insurance on any of our employees.
 As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various vendors, partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to successfully commercialize HEPLISAV-B and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to effectively manage our commercialization efforts, research efforts and clinical trials and hire, train and integrate additional regulatory, manufacturing, administrative, and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company and achieving profitability.
 Our business operations are vulnerable to interruptions by natural disasters, health epidemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and other catastrophic events beyond our control, the occurrence of which could materially harm our manufacturing, distribution, sales, business operations and financial results.
 Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters and other catastrophic events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, droughts, tornadoes, electrical blackouts, public health crises and pandemics, war, terrorism, and geo-political unrest and uncertainties. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business that might result from any such natural disaster or other catastrophic event and have limited recovery plans in place. If any of these events occur, our manufacturing and supply chain, distribution, sales and marketing efforts and other business operations could be subject to business shutdowns or disruptions and financial results could be adversely affected. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions resulting from these events, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and adversely affected in a number of ways, some of which are not predicable.
Our business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have manufacturing facilities, sales activities or other business operations. For example, outbreaks of epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or the fear of such events, have and could again in the future cause restrictions on supply chains, restrict access to workplaces and affect employee health and availability.
 Although we maintain inventories of HEPLISAV-B and its components, our ability and those of our contractors and distributors to produce and distribute HEPLISAV-B could be adversely affected. A pandemic or similar health challenge could severely impact the U.S. healthcare system, which may have an adverse effect on usage and sales of HEPLISAV-B. In addition, any such event could result in widespread global health crisis that could adversely affect global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for HEPLISAV-B and future revenue and operating results and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally resulted in significantly reduced utilization of all adult vaccines (other than the COVID-19 vaccines) since the end of the first quarter of 2020, including a reduction in the utilization of HEPLISAV-B.
 Additionally, our corporate headquarters in Emeryville, California, is located in a seismically active region that also is subject to possible electrical shutdowns and wildfires. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for earthquake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. We carry only limited business interruption insurance that would compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us in excess of insured amounts could adversely affect our business and operations.
 Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.
 Our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified our dependence on information technology systems as many of our critical business activities are currently being conducted remotely. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of key business processes.

In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches—whether by employees or others—that may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, collaborators, clinical trial patients, and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal, state and/or international data breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, including, but not limited to, HIPAA, similar state data protection regulations, and the GDPR, resulting in significant penalties; increased costs; loss of revenue; expenses of computer or forensic investigations; material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive or statutory damages; litigation; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; requirements that we provide notices, credit monitoring services and/or credit restoration services or other relevant services to impacted individuals; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; or injunctive relief. News reports have also highlighted COVID research-specific hacking and phishing attempts. Because we and our collaborators are working on vaccines, including potential COVID vaccines, we may be at higher-than-average risk for such attempts.
Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly.
 U.S. and international authorities have been warning businesses of increased cybersecurity threats from actors seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we experienced a cybersecurity incident known as a phishing e-mail scam, and although we do not consider its impact on us to be material, if we are unable to prevent this or other such data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. Moreover, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures that are intended to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events.
 Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
