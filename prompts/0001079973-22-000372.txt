Company Profile
 
Mana Capital Acquisition Corp. was formed on May 19, 2021 formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, as a blank check company for the purpose of engaging in a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in North America, Europe and Asia in the healthcare, technology, green economy, and consumer products sectors. We believe that we will add value to these businesses primarily by providing them with access to the U.S. capital markets.
 
Our Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on November 22, 2021. Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc., acted as lead bookrunner for our initial public offering. We may refer to our initial public offering in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our “IPO”. On November 26, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 6,200,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, and one right to receive one-seventh (1/7) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $62,000,000. In connection with our initial public offering, the underwriters were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to 930,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. On November 30, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 300,000 units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option. The additional units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $3,000,000.

Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 2,500,000 private warrants to our Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per private warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $2,500,000.
 
A total of $65,000,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the units and private placement warrants, including the sale of the units from the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.  
 
On June 22, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 1,437,500 shares of our common stock, or founder shares, for $25,000. Subsequently, in September 2021, we amended and restated the subscription agreement (the “First Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement”) and issued the Sponsor an additional 62,500 shares so that it would hold an aggregate of 20% of our outstanding common stock after our initial public offering. In November 2021, we entered into a second amendment and restatement of the subscription agreement with the Sponsor (the “Second Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement”) pursuant to which we issued it an additional 50,000 shares of Common Stock (so that the Sponsor would hold 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock after the initial public offering. Further, we agreed that if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option, we will issue the Sponsor such number of additional shares of common stock (up to 232,500 shares) so as to enable it to maintain its ownership of 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option, on November 30, 2021, we issued an additional 75,000 shares to the Sponsor pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement.
 
As a result of the IPO and the private placement, and assuming all of the units separate into their component parts, we had: (i) 6,500,000 units, (ii) 8,125,000 shares of common stock, (iii) 6,500,000 rights to acquire an aggregate of 928,571 shares of common stock; and (iv) 5,750,000 whole warrants to acquire 5,750,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2021. We have not issued any securities since such date.

Prior to the IPO, there had been no public market for our units, shares of common stock, rights or warrants. Our units, are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol “MAAQU”. The shares of common stock, rights and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on January 14, 2022 and are traded on Nasdaq under the symbols “MAAQ,” “MAAQR” and “MAAQW,” respectively. As our IPO registration statement and Form 8A were not declared effective by the SEC until November 22, 2021, we were not a filing company under the Securities and exchange Act of 1934, as amended until such date. 
 
A total of $65,000,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the units and private placement warrants, including the sale of the units from the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. 
 
As of December 31, 2021, there was $65,000,484 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes interest income available to us for franchise tax obligations of approximately $484 and $526,625 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2021, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the trust account to pay taxes.
 
The funds held in trust has been invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.
 
Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates and engaging in non-binding discussions with potential target entities. To date we have not entered into any binding agreement with any target entity. We presently have no revenue and have had losses since inception from incurring formation and operating costs since completion of our IPO.
 Management Business Combination Experience
 Our management team is led by Jonathan Intrater, Allan Liu and Loren Mortman; each has distinctive and complementary experience and extensive networks in the healthcare, technology, green economy and consumer products sectors as well as various other industries in North America, Europe, and Asia which we believe can provide a suitable selection of potential targets. We intend to focus on targeting middle market entities with a valuation in the $150 million to $500 million range.
 We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination opportunities with compelling characteristics and further potential. Members of our management team have extensive experience in executing business combinations, as they are long-term advisors to buyers and sellers in mergers and acquisitions, private equity investors, or buy and sell-side investment bankers. Jonathan Intrater, our Chief Executive Officer, is a Managing Director in the investment banking department at Ladenburg, Thalmann and has extensive experience in merger advisory and public offerings. He also served as a member of the Board and Chairman of the audit committee of GreenVision Acquisition Corp., a Nasdaq Capital Market-listed special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial business combination in August 2021. Allan Liu, one of the members of our Board of Directors, is a veteran investment manager in Asia. He has almost 40 years of broad experience in the financial industry, specializing in capital markets, private equity and venture capital investment. Mr. Liu has been involved in advising, managing and investing over US $20 billion in capital in hundreds of projects for international corporations and investors, and participated in building successful funds and asset management platforms. Loren Mortman, another member of our Board of Directors, has been President of The Equity Group Inc., an investor relations consulting firm founded in 1974 that specializes in investor communications, investment community outreach, and IR advisory for small-to-mid-cap public and pre-public companies, since 2013, Ms. Mortman has over 20 years of experience in developing public company clients’ critical communications, and advising on transactions and relations with the investment community. Prior to joining The Equity Group, Ms. Mortman was a Financial Analyst at Brenner Securities, an Investment Bank.

Our management team will actively source target candidates they believe will be attractive candidates for acquisition, and utilize their deal-making track record, professional relationships, and capital markets expertise to enhance the growth potential and value of a target business and provide opportunities for attractive returns to our stockholders. Past performance of our management team is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance.

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination with a company that meets one or more of the acquisition criteria described below.
 Our objective is to generate an attractive return for stockholders through a merger with an operating company with a strong record and growth potential. We expect to favor opportunities with certain business characteristics including some or all of the following: compelling long-term growth prospects, attractive competitive dynamics, consolidation opportunities, leading technological position and strong management. We will also consider additional factors such as high barriers to entry, significant streams of recurring revenue, margin profiles, and attractive free cash flow characteristics. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in North America, Europe and Asia in the healthcare, technology, green economy, and consumer products sectors.
 Our selection process will leverage our management team’s broad and deep relationship network, industry experience, and deal sourcing capabilities to access a range of opportunities. Our management team has a distinctive combination of capabilities including:
 •        analyzing performance, financial and otherwise, of public and private entities; and
 •        an extensive history of accessing the capital markets across various business cycles, including financing businesses and assisting companies with transition to public ownership.
 Our founders intend to communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination, and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may ultimately decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 •        have exhibited strong growth in revenue or profit in recent fiscal periods or have healthy cash flow from operations;
 •        will offer an attractive return for our stockholders, potential benefit from growth in the target’s business and with an improved capital structure will provide favorable upside measured against any identified downside risks;
 •        meet some key characteristics such as being or having the capability of being a disruptive participant within an industry;

-


•        are capable of achieving significant organic and/or acquisitive growth;
 •        are positioned to build stockholder value;
 •        have the potential to achieve a leading position in the industry in which it competes; or
 •        possess a proven management team prepared for being a public company.
 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. If we decide to enter into our business combination with a target business that does not meet all or some of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC and deliver to stockholders.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and key employees, document reviews and review of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion and they may not be able to rely upon such opinion.
 Members of our management team and our independent directors own or will own, directly or indirectly sponsor shares and/or private warrants following this offering which securities will be worthless if we fail to complete a business combination and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law.
 We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our Certificate of Incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company subject to his or her fiduciary duties under the laws of the State of Delaware and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.

Effecting A Business Combination
 We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In the case of a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. In either case, we will consummate our initial business combination only if upon such consummation either our shares are listed on a national securities exchange as contemplated by Rule 3a51-1(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or we have net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g) of the Exchange Act, or any successor rule) of at least $5,000,001 (in either case, so that we are not subject to Rule 3a51-1, which we refer to as the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 We have nine months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail below) from the consummation of our IPO to consummate our initial business combination. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extensions. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public stockholders, by way of redemption of their shares, and thereafter cease operations except for the purpose of winding up our affairs, as further described herein. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be $10.00 per share (regardless of whether or not the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option), without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 As stated above, we will have nine months from the consummation of our IPO to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within nine months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to twelve times, each by an additional one month (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination), subject to our board of directors authorizing such extension and the sponsor or its affiliates or designees depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our board of directors would adopt a resolution approving such extension and our founders or their respective affiliates or designees (which may include the potential target business), upon five days advance notice prior to each applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $216,667 (approximately $0.0333 per public share) for each one-month extension, up to an aggregate of $2,600,004, or $0.40 per public share (for an aggregate of 12 months), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each extension. The insiders or sponsor (or their respective affiliates or designees) providing such additional funds will receive non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory notes equal to the amount of any such deposit. The final and definitive terms of any such loans have not yet been negotiated, but any such loan would be interest free and will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the purchaser's discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional warrants on the basis of $1.00 per private warrant for each dollar amount deposited. These warrants would have an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public stockholders, by way of redemption of their shares, and thereafter cease operations except for the purpose of winding up our affairs, as further described herein.

In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor or their respective affiliates or designees at least five days prior to an applicable deadline of their intent to affect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to such applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after such applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. In such event, all warrants and rights will expire and will be worthless.
 The rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market require that our business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Although our Board of Directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our Board of Directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the Board of Directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our Board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. However, if Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange after this offering, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Status as a Public Company and Financial Considerations
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of common stock or for a combination of our shares of common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. We believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek stockholder approval of a business combination, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding rights, which may represent a source of future dilution.
 
With funds in the trust account of $65,000,000 available to use for a business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. In connection with any potential acquisition, we may be required to obtain acquisition financing. However, since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our business combination, and we may effectuate our business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.

Summary Information Related to Our Securities, Redemption Rights and Liquidation
 
We are a Delaware corporation and our affairs are governed by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.00001 par value each. The information provided below is a summary only and we refer you to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our warrant agreement and rights agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as warrant and rights agent for additional important and material information.
 
Upon completion of our IPO and as of March 29, 2022, we had and have 8,125,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Common stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders and vote together as a single class, except as required by law. Unless specified by applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of common stock that are voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our stockholders. Directors are elected for a term of one year. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share (subject to increase of up to an additional $0.40 per public share in the event that our sponsor elects to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination).
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our business combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our business combination only if a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions, if any, could result in the approval of our business combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
 
If we do not complete a business combination within 9 months (or up to 21 months, as discussed above) from the closing of our IPO, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

In connection with our IPO and consummation of the private placement with our sponsor we issued an aggregate of 6,500,000 rights to acquire an aggregate of 928,571 shares of common stock as a component of the public units. If we enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which we will be the surviving entity, each holder of a right will receive one-seventh (1/7) of one share upon consummation of our business combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares of common stock held by him, her or it in connection with the business combination or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation with respect to our pre-business combination activities. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive his, her or its additional shares upon consummation of an business combination as the consideration related thereto has been included in the unit purchase price paid for by investors in our IPO. The shares issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of ours). Holders of rights are not entitled to any redemption of voting rights. If we are unable to complete an business combination within the required time period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from our assets held outside of the trust account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless.
 
In connection with our IPO we issued an aggregate of 3,250,000 whole warrants to acquire an aggregate of 3,250,000 shares of common stock. In addition, in the private placement with our sponsor that we completed simultaneously with the IPO, we issued 2,500,000 warrants to acquire 2,500,000 shares of common stock. The warrants purchased in our IPO have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the date we consummated our IPO or 30 days from the completion of our business combination. Because the warrants may only be exercised for whole numbers of shares, only an even number of warrants may be exercised at any given time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrantholder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares. This means that only an even number of warrants may be exercised at any given time by a warrantholder. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 
Once the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption:

•        in whole and not in part;
 •        upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption,
 •         if, and only if, the last sales price of our shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption, and
 •        if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.

The redemption price for the warrants shall be either (i) if the holder of a warrant has followed the procedures specified in our notice of redemption and surrendered the warrant, the number of shares of common stock as determined in accordance with the “cashless exercise” provisions of the warrant agreement or (ii) if the holder of a warrant has not followed such procedures specified in our notice of redemption, the price of $0.01 per warrant. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption, each warrant holder can exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date either by paying the cash exercise price or on a “cashless exercise” basis. However, the price of our shares of common stock may fall below the $18.00 trigger price, as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.
 The private warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in our IPO except for certain transfer restrictions as described herein. The purchasers of the private warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private warrants or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the Sponsor and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the Sponsor must agree to) until the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of a liquidation prior to our initial business combination, the private warrants will expire worthless.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have one officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non- affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
We are a Delaware corporation incorporated on May 19, 2021. Our executive offices are located at 8 The Green, Suite #12490, Dover, Delaware 19901, and our telephone number is (302) 281-2147.
