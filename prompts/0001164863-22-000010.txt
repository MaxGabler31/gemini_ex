We believe that these raw materials and components are generally available from various suppliers, though there are limited suppliers for certain other minor, but critical, raw materials.
Research and Development 
The goal of our research and development effort is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products and services. We utilize a process to move product and service innovations from concept to commercialization, and to identify, analyze, develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth.
We employ scientists, engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop, design and test new and improved products and service solutions. We work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions. The majority of our research and development spending typically is directed toward the development of new sealing products for the most demanding environments, the development of technology to support the cleaning and refurbishment of process critical semiconductor manufacturing equipment components, and the development of bearing products and materials with increased load carrying capability and superior friction and wear.
Backlog
At December 31, 2021, we had a backlog of orders of continuing operations valued at $365.8 million compared with $212.5 million at December 31, 2020. Approximately 4% of the backlog is expected to be filled beyond 2022. Backlog represents orders on hand we believe to be firm. However, there is no certainty the backlog orders will result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered. Because of our short lead times and some seasonality, our business backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future performance.
Quality Assurance
We believe the quality of our products and services is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong, long-term relationships with our customers. In order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers, we maintain stringent standards of quality control. We routinely employ in-process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development, design and production to ensure product quality and reliability. These include state-of-the-art CAD/CAM equipment, statistical process control systems, laser tracking devices, failure mode and effect analysis, and coordinate measuring machines. We are able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our Computer Numerical Control ("CNC") machinery. In addition, we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource. As a result of our practices, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the services we provide and the parts we manufacture, avoid and reduce defects, and improve efficiency and reliability.
As of December 31, 2021, 40 of our manufacturing and service facilities, including all of our principal manufacturing facilities, were ISO 9000, QS 9000 and/or TS 16949 certified. Twelve of our facilities are ISO 14001 certified. OEMs are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures and as a condition of awarding business.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the U.S. and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these patents and trademarks. We routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the U.S. and other countries. We also have unpatented proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products and their use, and to certain services we perform. Except for proprietary formulations and know-how in our Advanced Surface Technologies segment, we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any particular patent, patent right, trademark, trade secret or license granted or group of related patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses granted.
In general, we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell. However, we also license certain intellectual property from various entities. These licenses are subject to renewal and it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated in the event of a material breach. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,400 employees, of which approximately 58% are in North America, 21% in Europe, 17% in Asia Pacific, and 4% in the rest of the world. 
We strive to create an environment where all employees can flourish. We are a dual bottom line company where human development is viewed as being equally important to financial results. This "Dual Bottom Line" philosophy is the backbone from which we operate. We believe human development leads to financial performance and the pursuit of financial performance results in human development. We foster a culture of learning and development because we believe that continuously improving ourselves will lead to personal and company success. Our core values of Safety, Excellence and Respect drive our focus on the way we do business and care for our people.
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. We continue to utilize inclusive practices within our talent acquisition practices such as requiring diverse candidate slates and diverse interview panels and have implemented tools and structures to reduce bias during the interview and selection process. Our percentage of female promotions in the U.S. has increased by 11% since January 2019. Gender, ethnic and racial diversity among our senior leadership team is 40%, which marks a 10% increase since December 2019. 
During calendar year 2021, we hosted 48 weekly “Courageous Conversations”, which focus on diversity, personal development and well-being and are open to all employees globally. We hosted 26 quarterly calls for our employee resource groups that are focused around the following employee communities: Women@EnPro, Mental Health, PRIDE, Community of Color, Asian and European Colleagues. These platforms further create and promote an environment at EnPro that encourage our colleagues to bring their whole selves to work.
As part of our commitment to our people, we provide a comprehensive compensation and benefits program that is designed to attract and retain employees. Our programs are structured to meet the changing needs of our employees and their families. In the U.S., this includes a company-wide minimum wage of $15 per hour, a 401k plan with company match, an award-winning wellbeing program, flexible vacation and time off policies that include a “take what you need” program for salaried employees, enhanced employee assistance programs, paid family leave, tuition assistance, and comprehensive healthcare benefits that includes medical, prescription drug, dental, life, disability, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, critical illness, and accidental, death and dismemberment coverages. 
We continue to demonstrate extreme care and compassion for our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered programs that cared for our employees’ physical needs, while also implementing several initiatives that provided emotional connection, and fostered psychological safety during these challenging times. The positive impact of our care, compassion and flexible programs is demonstrated by our employee retention rates. In particular, the retention rate of women (in the United States) at EnPro has risen in the past year, which is a remarkable achievement for a year in which hundreds of thousands of women have left the U.S. workforce, disproportionately to men, due to impacts of the pandemic.
In connection with our commitment to promoting diversity and improving the communities where our employees live and work, in 2020, we officially launched the EnPro Foundation to support charitable, educational, and other organizations working to advance education, equality, diversity, and the preservation of human dignity. We were able to provide grants of $20,000 to five organizations who support our foundation purpose to “Support the release of human possibility by investing in underserved populations in the areas of professional, educational, personal, and community development,”
Safety remains one of our three core values and we have worked hard to develop a world-class safety program and culture. Our commitment to safety has resulted in our being the only public company to have been recognized on three separate occasions by EHS Today as “America’s Safest Company”.
