ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We discover, develop and sell proteins that deliver value to our clients in a growing set of industries. We view proteins as a vast untapped source of value-creating materials, and we are using our proven technologies, which have been continuously improved over our fifteen year history, to commercialize an increasing number of novel proteins, both as proprietary Codexis products and in partnership with our customers.
Many companies have historically used naturally occurring proteins to produce or enhance goods used in everyday life. Despite the growing number of commercial applications of naturally occurring proteins across many industries, the inherent limitations of naturally-occurring proteins frequently restrict their commercial use. Through the application of our proprietary CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, we are able to engineer novel proteins to overcome these restrictions, thereby adding value or opening up new prospects for our potential clients’ products, processes or businesses. We have developed new proteins that are significantly more stable and/or active in our commercial applications than proteins derived from nature.
We are also a pioneer in the harnessing of computational technologies to drive biology advancements. Over the last fifteen years, we have made substantial investments in the development of our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, the primary source of our competitive advantage. Our technology platform is powered by proprietary, artificial intelligence-based, computational algorithms that rapidly mine our large and continuously growing library of protein variants’ performance attributes. These computational outputs enable increasingly reliable predictions for next generation protein variants to be engineered, enabling delivery of targeted performance enhancements in a time-efficient manner. In addition to its computational prowess, our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform integrates additional modular competencies, including robotic high-throughput screening and genomic sequencing, organic chemistry and process development which are all coordinated to create our novel protein innovations.
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to grow our revenues, profits, and stockholder value by leveraging our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform in the following ways:

• | Licensing our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to license our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to third parties so they can create cost-saving protein catalyst solutions utilizing their own in-house protein engineering capability.


• | Growing our pharmaceutical protein catalysts business. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the pharmaceutical market to use our protein catalysis products and services to reduce the costs for manufacturing small molecule drugs. We intend to increase the number of pharmaceutical customers and processes that utilize and benefit from our novel, cost-saving protein catalyst solutions.


• | Growing our fine chemicals protein catalysts business. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the fine chemicals market to use protein catalysis products and services to reduce the costs for manufacturing in adjacent markets like food and food ingredients. We intend to increase the number of fine chemical customers and processes who utilize and benefit from our novel, cost-saving protein catalyst solutions.


• | Creating and advancing novel biotherapeutic drug candidates. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to apply our protein engineering capabilities to the creation and development of novel biotherapeutic drug candidates, both in partnership with customers and as proprietary Codexis drug candidates. We have also invested in research and development in an effort to generate additional early stage novel biotherapeutic candidates.


• | Developing high-performance enzymes for use in diagnostic applications. We intend to offer high-performance enzymes to customers using next generation sequencing (“NGS”) and polymerase chain reaction (“PCR/qPCR”) for in vitro molecular diagnostic applications.

In this Annual Report, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Codexis, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
Pharmaceutical Market
We believe the pharmaceutical industry represents a significant market opportunity for us and is our primary business focus. Pharmaceutical companies are in constant search for new drugs to offer to their customers, and are under significant competitive pressure both to reduce costs and to increase the speed to market for their products. To meet these pressures, pharmaceutical companies are discovering and developing novel protein-based drug products, as well as seeking manufacturing processes for their new and existing drugs that reduce overall costs, simplify production and increase efficiency and product yield, while not affecting drug safety and efficacy. Cost reduction is even more important to developers (known as innovators) of patent-protected pharmaceutical products when the patents for those products expire and such innovators are forced to compete with manufacturers of generic drugs.
The pharmaceutical product lifecycle begins with the discovery of new chemical entities and continues through preclinical and clinical development, regulatory review and approval, commercial scale-up, product launch, and, ultimately, patent expiration and the transition from branded to generic products. As innovators develop, produce and then market products, manufacturing priorities and processes evolve. Historically, innovators have focused on production cost reduction in the later stages of clinical development and have been reluctant to make process changes after a product has been launched. However, as pressures to reduce costs have increased, innovators have pursued cost reduction measures much earlier in the pharmaceutical product lifecycle and are increasingly looking for opportunities to improve their operating margins, including making manufacturing process changes for marketed products after the products have been launched if these changes can result in significant cost reductions. As a result, innovators are investing in new technologies, including our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, to improve their manufacturing productivity and efficiency or outsourcing the manufacture of their intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”).
Our Solutions for the Pharmaceutical Market 
Small Molecule Manufacturing Cost Reduction
Our pharmaceutical customers, which include many large global pharmaceutical companies, use our technology, products and services in their manufacturing processes and process development. Our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform enables us to deliver solutions to our customers in this market by developing and delivering optimized protein catalysts that perform chemical transformations at a lower cost and improve the efficiency and productivity of manufacturing processes. We provide value throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle. Our products and services allow us to provide benefits to our pharmaceutical customers in a number of cost saving ways, including any - and sometimes all - of the following:
•reducing the use of raw materials and reagents; 
•eliminating multiple steps in the manufacturing process;
•improving purity, productivity and yield; 
•using water as a primary solvent; 
•eliminating hazardous inputs; 
•enabling the use of simple equipment and reducing the need for capital expenditure;
•reducing energy requirements; 
•reducing the generation of chemical byproducts or waste; and
•reducing the need for late-stage purifications. 
Early in a pharmaceutical product’s lifecycle, pharmaceutical manufacturers can use our protein catalyst products and services to reduce manufacturing costs. If an innovator incorporates our products or processes into an approved product, we expect the innovator to continue to use our products or processes at least over the patent life of the marketed drug.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers can also use our products and services to reduce manufacturing costs after a product is launched. At this stage, changes in the manufacturing process originally approved by the drug regulator may require additional regulatory review. Typically, pharmaceutical companies will only seek regulatory approval for a manufacturing change if substantial cost savings are realizable. We believe that the cost savings associated with our products may lead our customers to change their manufacturing processes for approved products and, if necessary, seek regulatory approval of the new processes which incorporate our proteins. Moreover, we believe these cost savings are attractive to generics manufacturers, who compete primarily on price.
In addition, manufacturing processes that utilize our protein catalysts can frequently enable processes that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly compared to alternative, traditional manufacturing approaches. This has led Codexis to earn three US EPA Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge awards for improved pharmaceutical manufacturing processes since we were 
5

founded. All three of these awards were associated with blockbuster drug products.
Discovery and Development of Biotherapeutic Drug Candidates
We are also targeting new opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry to discover or improve biotherapeutic drug candidates for our customers. We believe that our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology can be used to discover novel biotherapeutic drug candidates that will target human diseases that are in need of improved therapeutic interventions. Similarly, we believe that we can deploy our platform technology to improve specific characteristics of a customer’s pre-existing biotherapeutic drug candidate, such as its activity, stability or immunogenicity.
Collaborative Biotherapeutic Product Development
We are using our platform technology to improve characteristics of our customers’ pre-existing biotherapeutic drug candidates. In July 2016, we successfully completed our obligations under a collaborative research and development agreement with a leading global biopharmaceutical company. Under that agreement, we employed our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology to develop a novel enzyme for use in our partner’s preclinical therapeutic development program. During this project, we earned success fees, associated milestone payments and research and development service revenues. We continue to pursue other customers who could benefit by applying our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology to improve the discovery and/or development of other biotherapeutics in partnership with Codexis.
Biotherapeutic Product Development
We are also using our platform technology to develop our own early stage, novel enzyme therapeutic product candidates. Our lead product candidate is CDX-6114, an enzyme which we have engineered to be orally administered and are developing as a potential treatment of PKU in humans. PKU is an inborn metabolic disorder in which the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine is deficient. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates to toxic levels in the brain, causing serious neurological problems including intellectual disability, seizures and cognitive and behavioral problems. To avoid toxic levels of phenylalanine in their blood, individuals with PKU must follow a strict, life-long diet that is low in phenylalanine and supplement their diet with a synthetic phenylalanine-free formula to provide them with sufficient nutrients. Maintaining a strict, life-long diet can be challenging for individuals with PKU. There are an estimated 50,000 people with PKU in the developed world.
In addition to the PKU program, we have previously made, and expect to continue to make additional investments with the aim of generating additional product candidates targeting other therapeutic areas.
Nestlé Health Science
On October 12, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a Global Development, Option and License Agreement (the “Nestlé Agreement”) with Nestec Ltd. (“Nestlé Health Science”).
Pursuant to the Nestlé Agreement, we granted to Nestlé Health Science, under certain of our patent rights and know-how: (i) an option (the “Option”) to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize certain products (each, a “Product”) based on CDX-6114 and our other therapeutic enzyme product candidates for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia (“HPA”), and (ii) an exclusive right of first negotiation (the “Right of First Negotiation”) for a period of five years to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize up to two enzymes discovered by us for use in the field of the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. We are not under any obligation to undertake any research and development activities relating to inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. HPA (also referred to as PKU) is a medical condition characterized by elevated concentrations of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. PKU can result in severe HPA. 
Under the terms of the Nestlé Agreement, upon the License Effective Date (defined below) after the Option trigger, Nestlé Health Science will be granted a license to any enzyme (each, a “Compound”) covered by specified patent applications, other than any enzyme that has other clinically significant, specified activity against another molecule, unless that enzyme’s specified activity against phenylalanine is ten times greater than its activity against such other molecule (in which case it is not excluded). Furthermore, we generally will retain the right to use any enzyme as a biocatalyst, provided that preclinical development of such enzyme has not commenced. The first Compound to be developed under the Nestlé Agreement is our enzyme CDX-6114 (the “Initial Compound”).
Nestlé Health Science has the sole discretion to exercise the Option after the effectiveness of an investigational new drug application filed by us for the study of the Initial Compound for the treatment of HPA and the completion of a Phase 1a study by us (the “Option Trigger Date”). The effective date of the license granted in connection with the Option exercise will either be the date that Nestlé Health Science notifies us of Nestlé Health Science’s exercise of the Option if Nestlé Health Science 
6

determines that no antitrust clearance is necessary, or the date that any antitrust clearance Nestlé Health Science determines is required is obtained (“License Effective Date”). The Option will expire 60 days after the Option Trigger Date if unexercised by Nestlé Health Science. If Nestlé Health Science exercises the Option and determines that a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) is necessary in connection with the Option exercise, our obligation to grant the license under the Option will expire if the HSR filing does not receive clearance within 180 days of filing and such delay is not attributable to any material failure on our part to cooperate in the HSR review process.
The Nestlé Agreement also sets forth the parties’ respective obligations for development, commercialization, regulatory and manufacturing and supply activities for the Initial Compound and Product containing the Initial Compound. Prior to the earlier to occur of the Option expiration date or the License Effective Date, we will be generally responsible for development activities, including a Phase 1a study. Following the License Effective Date, Nestlé Health Science will be responsible for development activities. Our development activities will be governed by a development plan and overseen by a joint steering committee. The parties will establish a patent committee to discuss strategies and coordinate activities for the patents related to Initial Compound and Product containing the Initial Compound, and will jointly own all inventions and information that result from each party’s activities performed under the Nestlé Agreement. The Nestlé Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties by the parties, intellectual property protection provisions, certain indemnification rights in favor of each party and customary confidentiality provisions and limitations of liability.
Nestlé Health Science paid us an upfront cash payment of $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Pursuant to the Agreement, Nestle is obligated to pay us $4.0 million after the commencement of a Phase 1a clinical trial and in the event Nestlé exercises the Option, they will be obligated to pay us $3.0 million within 60 days after the license effective date. Other potential payments from Nestlé Health Science to us under the Agreement include (i) development and approval milestones of up to $86.0 million, (ii) sales-based milestones of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, which aggregate amount is achievable if net sales exceed $1.0 billion in a single year, and (iii) tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the middle single digits to low double-digits, of net sales of products containing a Compound as its sole active ingredient.
In addition to the Nestlé Agreement, we and Nestlé Health Science concurrently entered into a strategic collaboration agreement pursuant to which we and Nestlé Health Science will collaborate to leverage the CodeEvolver® platform technology to develop novel enzymes for Nestlé Health Science’s established Consumer Care and Medical Nutrition business areas.
Fine Chemicals Markets
Beyond the pharmaceutical industry, our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology has enabled cost-savings for our partners in the fine chemicals markets, and the food industry in particular. In November 2016, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Tate & Lyle, a market-leading food ingredients company, to supply a proprietary enzyme for use in Tate & Lyle’s food ingredient production. In March 2017, we announced a second multi-year research and development services agreement with Tate & Lyle for the development of a second ingredient for the food ingredient industry. We are seeking to expand our protein catalyst offerings in the fine chemicals market within and beyond the food industry, including, for example, to the agricultural chemicals and flavors and fragrances markets. 
Molecular Biology and In Vitro Diagnostic Enzymes 
We believe that our Codexis protein engineering capability can also be deployed to commercialize novel enzymes as improvements to enzymes consumed by customers in many industrial sectors. As our first effort in this strategy, we have developed an enzyme for customers using NGS and PCR/qPCR for in vitro molecular diagnostic applications. Our first proprietary enzyme for this market targets improved library preparation for NGS users and is currently being beta tested. It is expected to be available commercially in 2018.
Licensing Our CodeEvolver® Protein Engineering Technology Platform
Our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform enables rapid development of custom-designed enzymes that are highly optimized for efficient manufacturing processes. We intend to continue to enter into license arrangements with third parties that will allow them to use our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to discover and develop novel proteins for their internal use. To date, we have entered into platform technology licensing agreements with each of GlaxoSmithKline and Merck.
GlaxoSmithKline
We entered into our first CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology Platform Technology Transfer, Collaboration and License Agreement (“GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement”) on July 10, 2014 with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline plc (collectively, “GSK”).

We also granted a license to GSK to make or have made products developed using our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, with a right to grant sublicenses solely to affiliates of GSK, contract manufacturing organizations and contract research organizations. This manufacturing license is exclusive in the GSK Exclusive Field and otherwise non-exclusive in the Field. The licenses granted by us to GSK are subject to certain limitations based on pre-existing contractual obligations that apply to the technology and intellectual property that is the subject of the license grants. In addition, GSK is prohibited from using our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to develop or produce any enzymes or other compounds for or on behalf of any third party except that GSK can exercise its license rights in connection with certain research and development programs jointly performed with a bona fide third party collaborator so long as GSK uses our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform independently from the third party collaborator and complies with all of the other restrictions and obligations under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement.
Under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement, we transferred our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to GSK over a twenty-one-month period that began on July 10, 2014. As a part of this technology transfer, we provided to GSK our proprietary enzymes, proprietary protein engineering protocols and methods, and proprietary software algorithms. In addition, teams of our and GSK scientists participated in technology training sessions and collaborative research projects at our laboratories in Redwood City, California and at GSK’s laboratories in Upper Merion, Pennsylvania. The technology transfer was completed in April 2016 and our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform has been installed at GSK’s Upper Merion, Pennsylvania site. We have the potential to receive additional contingent payments that range from $5.75 million to $38.5 million per project based on GSK's successful application of the licensed technology. 
We are also eligible to receive royalties based on net sales, if any, of a limited set of products developed by GSK using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform.
The licenses to GSK were granted under certain patents, patent applications and know-how that we owned or controlled as of the effective date of the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement and that cover our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform and certain enzymes useful in the Field. Any improvements to our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the technology transfer period were included in the license grants from us to GSK.
Under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement, GSK owns (the “GSK-Owned Technology”) (a) any enzyme technology that was developed during a project under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement that used our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the technology transfer period and (b) the methods of use of any Project Enzyme in compound synthesis that were developed during the technology transfer period. GSK granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use outside of the GSK Exclusive Field, the GSK-Owned Technology that was developed during the technology transfer period.
Until July 10, 2019 (the “Embargo Period”), GSK is prohibited from using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform for the use, research or development (whether in vitro or in vivo) or commercialization of any enzyme or enzyme fusion protein that (a) effects a chemical transformation in humans or (b) facilitates, assists, transports or enables the action, dispersion, absorption or bioavailability of a molecule, biologic agent, drug product, therapeutic agent or other compound in humans (the “Embargo Field”).

Merck
On August 3, 2015, we entered into a CodeEvolver® platform technology transfer and license agreement (the “Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (collectively, “Merck”).
The Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement allows Merck to use our proprietary CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology in the field of human and animal healthcare. 
Under the terms of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, we granted to Merck a non-exclusive worldwide license to use the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to research, develop and manufacture novel enzymes for use by Merck in its internal research programs (“Merck Non-Exclusive Field”). The license to Merck is exclusive for the research, development and manufacture of novel enzymes for use by Merck in the chemical synthesis of therapeutic products owned or controlled by Merck (“Merck Exclusive Field”). Merck has the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates of Merck and, in certain limited circumstances, to third parties. We also granted to Merck a license to make or have made products manufactured using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform with a right to grant sublicenses solely to affiliates of Merck, contract manufacturing organizations and contract research organizations. The manufacturing license is exclusive in the Merck Exclusive Field and non-exclusive in the Merck Non-Exclusive Field. The licenses are subject to certain limitations based on pre-existing contractual obligations that apply to the technology and intellectual property that are the subject of the license grants. The licenses do not permit the use of the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to discover any therapeutic enzyme, diagnostic product or vaccine. In addition, Merck is prohibited from using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to develop or produce enzymes or any other compounds for or on behalf of any third parties except in a very limited manner when Merck divests a therapeutic product that is manufactured using an enzyme developed using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform.
Under the terms of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, Merck paid us $18.0 million in technology transfer up-front and milestone payments over the technology transfer period of 15 months from August 3, 2015, the effective date of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement. We also have the potential to receive product-related payments of up to $15.0 million for each API that is manufactured by Merck using one or more enzymes that have been developed or are in development using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the 10-year period that begins on the conclusion of the 15-month technology transfer period. These product-related payments, if any, will be paid by Merck to us for each quarter that Merck manufactures API using a CodeEvolver®-developed enzyme. The payments will be based on the total volume of API produced using the CodeEvolver®-developed enzyme. We have the right to conduct an annual audit to confirm that all payments that are owed to us have been paid in full and on time.
Under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, we transferred the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to Merck over the period from August 2015 through September 2016. As part of this technology transfer, we provided to Merck our proprietary enzymes, proprietary protein engineering protocols and methods, and proprietary software algorithms. We provided additional enzyme evolution services to Merck at our laboratories in Redwood City through November 2016. The remaining deferred revenue relating to the upfront payment was recognized upon completion of the additional enzyme evolution services.
The licenses to Merck are granted under patents, patent applications and know-how that we owned or controlled as of the effective date of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement and that cover the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform. Any improvements to the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the technology transfer period are also included in the license grants from Codexis to Merck. Following the technology transfer period, Merck can exercise annual options that, upon payment of certain option fees, would extend Merck’s license to include certain improvements to the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform that arise during the three-year period that begins at the end of the technology transfer period.
Under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, we own any improvements to our protein engineering methods, processes and algorithms that arose and any enzyme technology or process technology that are developed during an evolution program or additional services. Merck owns (the “Merck-Owned Technology”) (a) any enzyme technology that is developed solely by Merck under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform (a “Project Enzyme”) and (b) the methods of use of any Project Enzyme or any enzyme developed jointly by Merck and us using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform. Merck granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use the Merck-Owned Technology outside of the Merck Exclusive Field.
For each API that Merck manufactures using an enzyme developed with the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, we will have a right of first refusal to supply Merck with the enzyme used to manufacture the API if Merck 
9

outsources the supply of the enzyme. Our right of first refusal applies during the period that begins on the completion of a phase III clinical trial for the product containing the API and ends five years following regulatory approval for such product.
The Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement has a term that continues, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement. Merck may terminate the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement by providing 90 days written notice to us. We can terminate the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement by providing 30 days written notice to Merck if we determine, pursuant to our contractual audit rights under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, that Merck has repeatedly failed to make required payments to us and/or materially underpaid us an amount due under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement. In the event the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement is terminated earlier by Merck, or by us due to an uncured material breach by Merck, or if Merck sells or transfers to a third party any Merck business or facility that includes any of our proprietary materials, information or technology, we have the right to conduct an audit of Merck’s facilities to confirm that all of our proprietary materials, information and technology have been destroyed. The Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement contains indemnification provisions under which Merck and we have agreed to indemnify each other against certain third party claims.
In September 2016, we completed the full transfer of the engineering platform technology and earned milestone revenue of $8.0 million. We received the $8.0 million milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Protein Catalyst Products and Services
Our protein catalyst products and services can deliver value to our customers in multiple potential ways:
•manufacture their products at lower cost;
•manufacture their products with lower fixed capital investment;
•reduce the cost of development of complex chemical synthesis processes;
•enable their products to achieve higher product purity; 
•reduce the risk of adverse effects arising from product impurities;
•allow the removal of entire steps from chemical production; and
•flexibility to apply at any point across their product’s lifecycle.
Our products include protein catalysts, chemical intermediates and Codex® Biocatalyst Panels and Kits. We sell our products worldwide primarily through our directed sales and business development force in the United States and Europe.
In addition to products, we also offer research and development services to our customers. These research and development service agreements often contain service fee payments and intellectual property provisions under which we screen and/or engineer protein catalysts for customers in connection with their process development efforts. In these collaborations, we typically receive consideration in the form of one or more of the following: up-front payments, milestone payments, payments for screening and engineering services, licensing fees and royalties.
Protein Catalysts
We often sell protein catalysts (also referred to as biocatalysts or enzymes), by the gram or kilogram, that have been already been engineered, scaled up, and installed in a customer’s commercial process. For example, we sell protein catalysts to Merck for their manufacture of Sitagliptin, the active ingredient in Januvia®. We also sell protein catalysts which are in developmental stages. These are enzymes that are sold in batches or by the gram or kilogram that are in the process of being engineered or scaled up by Codexis, or are in the process of being trialed or approved for use in the customer’s process. We may sell batches of specific protein catalysts that are in the middle of our protein engineering efforts to test their performance at a larger customer scale. We also may sell batches of specific protein catalysts for use in customer’s developmental products (for example, to trial in a customer’s Phase II drug candidate process). Finally, we may sell batches of specific protein catalysts as a customer performs trials for approval in their commercial manufacturing operations.
Chemical Intermediates
In some cases, we sell intermediate chemicals products that are produced in a process that uses our protein catalysts. These chemical intermediates are then used by our customer for further chemical processing. 
10

Codex® Biocatalyst Panels and Kits
We sell kits and panels of our protein catalysts. These kits and panels assemble a relevant subset of our engineered enzymes to enable customers to perform chemistry screening on their own. These kits and panels are organized by specific types of chemical reactions that are widely applicable in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical markets. 
Protein Catalyst Screening Services
If a customer prefers, rather than purchasing our Codex® Biocatalyst Panels or Kits to use for its own screening, it may send us its starting materials and desired chemical reaction, and we will test against our existing libraries of enzymes on a research and development service fee basis. If we detect desired activity in a specific enzyme, we can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform engineering services to improve the performance of the enzyme.
Protein Engineering Services
We work with our customers throughout their product development lifecycle to optimize enzymes that have been engineered specifically to perform a desired process according to a highly selective set of specifications. We typically charge customers on research and development services basis by project or project-month. These are typically larger research and development service fees than screening services.
The protein engineering process starts by identifying genes that code for enzymes known to have the general type of catalytic reactivity for a desired chemical reaction. Typically, we identify gene sequences from our extensive in-house collection or from published databases and then synthesize candidate genes having those sequences. Using a variety of biotechnology tools, we diversify these genes by introducing mutations, giving rise to changes in the enzymes for which they encode. The methods for diversifying these genes, and types of diversity being tested, often vary over the course of a protein engineering program. For finding initial diversity, methods typically include random mutagenesis and site-directed (included computational structure-guided) mutagenesis. We also test mutational variations from related enzymes found in different organisms.
Once we have identified potentially beneficial mutations, we create libraries of thousands of variants with combinations of these mutations. With our proprietary genetic manipulation tools, we generate libraries of genes that have programmed and random combinations of the mutations for testing. The pool of genes is used to transform host cells, which entails introducing the various genes into host cells. These cells are then grown into colonies. Cells from individual colonies are cultured in high throughput to produce the enzyme encoded by the genetic variant in those cells. The enzymes expressed by these cells are then screened in high throughput using test conditions relevant to the desired process. The screening results allow us to identify and catalog individual genes that produce improved enzymes with beneficial mutations as well as enzymes having detrimental ones. Using specifically developed test conditions and analytical methods, we can identify variant enzymes that exhibit various improved performance characteristics, such as stability, activity and selectivity, under conditions relevant to the desired chemical process.
In the next step in our optimization process, we use our proprietary bioinformatics software to analyze protein sequence-activity relationships. Our software and algorithms relate the screening results to the mutations and ranks the individual and interacting protein sequence mutations with regard to their degree of benefit or detriment, relative to the process parameter(s) tested. Using this information, we can create a select pool of mutational diversity in the next iteration to further the accumulation of beneficial diversity and cancel out detrimental diversity in the individual genes in the resulting library. The gene that codes for the best performing enzyme in one iteration is used as the starting gene for the next iteration of recombination and screening. As the enzymes improve over these iterations, the screening conditions are made increasingly more stringent. In this way, the protein catalyst is rapidly optimized until all in-process performance requirements have been achieved and the economic objectives for the desired process have been met.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and technology under patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. We also rely heavily on confidential disclosure agreements for further protection of our proprietary products and technologies. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products that are not available from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from practicing technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed from other parties. For example, our ability to supply innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers depends on our ability to supply proprietary enzymes or methods for making pharmaceutical intermediates or APIs that are not available from our competitors. Likewise, in the generic pharmaceutical area, proprietary protection, through patent, trade secret or other protection of our enzymes and methods of producing a pharmaceutical product is important for us and our customers to maintain a lower cost production advantage over competitors.

As of December 31, 2017, we owned or controlled approximately 1,100 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications include many that are directed to our enabling technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceutical markets. Our current intellectual property rights have terms that expire between 2018 and 2038. Our United States intellectual property rights directed to the CodeEvolver® proprietary enabling technology platform developed internally by us have terms that expire between 2029 to 2034. Our current intellectual property rights also include patents, trademarks, copyrights, software and certain assumed contracts that we acquired from Maxygen, Inc. (“Maxygen”) in October 2010, which are associated with directed evolution technology, known as the MolecularBreeding™ technology platform developed by Maxygen. The intellectual property rights and assets that we acquired from Maxygen continue to be subject to existing exclusive and non-exclusive license rights granted by Maxygen to third parties. We continue to file new patent applications, for which terms generally extend 20 years from the non-provisional filing date in the United States. 
We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain trade secrets in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. We sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to conduct business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned and used the following registered, pending, and common law trademarks in the United States, with some trademarks also registered or pending in foreign jurisdictions: Codexis®, Codex®, CodeEvolver®, Mosaic®, Sage™, Microcyp®, MYCP®, ProSAR™, Unlock the Power of Proteins™, Codexis Protein Engineering Experts™, Transform Your Thinking™, and a Codexis design mark (i.e., the Codexis logo). 
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to operate under aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. 
Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. 
Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from litigation relating to intellectual property could require us to obtain a license to continue to make, use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology.

COMPETITION
We face differing forms of competition in the small molecule pharmaceuticals, biotherapeutics, and fine chemicals markets, as set forth below.
Small Molecule Pharmaceuticals
We market our protein catalyst products and services to manufacturers of small molecule pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs. Our primary competitors in that market are companies marketing either conventional, non-enzymatic catalysts or alternative protein catalyst products and services. We also face competition sometimes from existing in-house technologies (both biocatalysts and conventional catalysts) within our client and potential client companies. The principal methods of competition and competitive differentiation in this market are price, product quality and performance, including manufacturing yield, safety and environmental benefits and speed of delivery of product. Pharmaceutical manufacturers that use biocatalytic processes can face increased competition from manufacturers that use more conventional processes and/or manufacturers that are based in regions (such as India and China) with lower regulatory, safety and environmental costs.
The market for the manufacture and supply of APIs and intermediates is large with many established companies. These companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers, such as Merck, GSK, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which have significant internal research and development efforts directed at developing processes to manufacture APIs and intermediates. The processes used by these companies include classical conventional organic chemistry reactions, chemo catalytic reactions, biocatalytic, reactions or combinations thereof. Our protein catalyst based manufacturing processes must compete with these internally developed routes. 
Companies developing and marketing conventional catalysts include Solvias AG, BASF, Johnson-Mathey, and Takasago International Corporation.
The market for supplying enzymes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing is quite fragmented. There is competition from large industrial enzyme companies, such as Novozymes, as well as subsidiaries of larger contract research/contract manufacturing organizations (“CRO/CMO”), such as Royal DSM N.V. (“DSM”), Cambrex Corporation and Almac Group Ltd. There is also competition in the customized and optimized enzyme area from several smaller companies, such as BRAIN AG, Arzeda, c-LEcta GmbH, Gingko Bioworks and Evocatal GmbH. 
We believe that our principal advantage is our ability to rapidly deliver customized protein catalysts for existing and new intermediates and APIs in the pharmaceutical manufacturing market. This capability has allowed us to create a breadth of protein catalysts with improved performance characteristics including, for example, better activity, stability, and activity on a range of substrates, compared to traditional chemistry-based manufacturing processes and naturally occurring (and thus not optimized) biocatalysts. We believe that our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology provides substantially superior results, in shorter time frames, than companies offering competing biocatalyst development services. 
Biotherapeutics
There are numerous companies that participate in the biotherapeutics market generally and the PKU market specifically. Many of these companies are large, successful and well-capitalized. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (“BioMarin”) and Daiichi Sankyo Company market Kuvan® in the United States, Europe and Japan for the treatment of a certain type of PKU. The FDA is currently reviewing a biologics license application (“BLA”) from BioMarin for an injectable enzyme substitution therapy for the potential treatment of PKU. Shire Plc, Genzyme / Sanofi S.A. and other companies market or are actively developing new biotherapeutics. There are numerous companies that are developing other forms of therapeutics, such as small molecules and gene therapy, which could compete with biotherapeutics. 
Fine Chemicals
We entered the fine chemicals market in 2013 by applying our protein engineering technology in the food market. We face similar forms of competition in this market as in the small molecule pharmaceutical markets, with the exception that the risk of losing opportunities to larger competitors in fine chemicals is greater given the larger scale of opportunities available in the fine chemicals market compared to the pharmaceutical market. Our significant competitors in the fine chemicals markets include companies that have been in these marketplaces for many years, such as DuPont Industrial Biosciences (DuPont Genencor), DSM, Novozymes and A.B. Enzymes. These companies have greater resources in these markets than we do and have long-term supply arrangements already in place with customers. Our ability to compete in these markets may be limited by our relatively late entrance. We also face competition in both the fine chemicals and small molecule pharmaceutical markets from emerging companies offering whole cell metabolic pathway approaches to these markets.

Core Technology
We are a leader in the field of protein engineering to create novel biocatalysts. Both our pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals businesses rely on our core technology. We are aware that other companies, organizations and persons have developed technologies that appear to have some similarities to our patented proprietary technologies. For example, we are aware that other companies, including DSM and BASF, have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity. In addition, academic institutions such as the California Institute of Technology, the Max Planck Institute and the Austrian Centre of Industrial Biotechnology are also working in this field. This field is highly competitive with companies and academic and research institutions actively seeking to develop technologies that could be competitive with our technologies.
Technological developments by others may result in our products and technologies, as well as products manufactured by our customers using our biocatalysts, becoming obsolete. We monitor publications and patents that relate to directed molecular evolution to be aware of developments in the field and evaluate appropriate courses of action in relation to these developments. 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing and/or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors.
OPERATIONS
Our corporate headquarters is located in Redwood City, California and provides general administrative support to our business and is the center of our research, development and business operations. We have limited internal manufacturing capacity at our headquarters in Redwood City. We expect to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial production of our biocatalysts for the foreseeable future. Our in-house manufacturing is dedicated to producing both Codex® Biocatalyst Panels and Kits and enzymes for use by our customers in pilot scale production. We also supply initial commercial quantities of biocatalysts for use by our collaborators to produce pharmaceutical intermediates and manufacture biocatalysts that we sell. Please see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our revenues and long-lived assets both within and outside of the United States.
Our research and development operations include efforts directed towards engineering protein catalysts, bioprocess development, cellular engineering, biocatalyst screening, metabolites, strain improvement, fermentation development and process engineering. We conduct enzyme evolution, enzyme production development, microbial bioprocess development, cellular engineering, microbial evolution and process engineering evaluations and design primarily at our headquarters in Redwood City, California. For more information on our research and development expenditures, see Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Manufacturing of our enzymes is conducted primarily in three locations, at our in-house facility in Redwood City, California and at third-party contract manufacturing organizations, Lactosan, GmbH & Co. KG (“Lactosan”), in Kapfenberg, Austria and DPhar SpA (“DPhar”) in Agnani, Italy. Generally, we perform smaller scale manufacturing in-house and outsource the larger scale manufacturing and a large percentage of our production of novel enzymes to contract manufacturing organizations.
