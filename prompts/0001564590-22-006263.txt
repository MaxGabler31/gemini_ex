ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

 Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 
 We are a leading metals service center, value-added processor, and distributor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct processing and distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited, a Chinese limited liability company (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson Mexico, and Ryerson China together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” 
 Our Company 
 We are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. We have approximately 4,000 employees across 91 facilities in North America and four facilities in China. Through this network we serve approximately 40,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end-markets. Our customers range from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of nearly 75,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. In addition to our metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services, and nearly 80% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements. 
Our business strategy includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services, and inventory management solutions while maintaining low operating costs in order to maximize financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions.  
 To that end, we continue to focus on our interconnected network, systems, and to enhance our value-added services and online presence to provide increased access, functionality, and flexibility to our customers. We are using advanced analytics to improve pricing and inventory utilization. Our service centers are strategically located near our customers, which permits us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often the day after receiving an order. We own, lease, or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to service a diverse customer base and to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability. 
 We focus on strategic acquisitions that complement and enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. Ryerson’s M&A strategy includes both transformative turnaround acquisitions and value-add, bolt-on acquisitions. Recently, Ryerson has focused on bolt-on acquisitions such as its September 1, 2021 acquisition of Specialty Metals Processing, Inc. (“SMP”).  SMP is a toll processor of stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, and nickel alloy products that expanded the Company’s value-add services in a variety of industries including aerospace. SMP was purchased for $14.0 million, net of cash acquired.
 Industry Overview 
 Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. They purchase in scale and sell in smaller quantities.  End-users often look for “one-stop” suppliers that offer lower order volumes, shorter lead times, more reliable delivery, and processing services. Metal producers mainly sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars, and tubes in large quantities, with longer lead times, and limited inventory. Metal service centers serve as key intermediaries closing the gap between metal producers’ supply and end-users’ demand. 
 By aggregating end-users’ demand and purchasing metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale, metals service centers may purchase, process, and deliver metal to end‑users in a more efficient and cost‑effective manner than the end‑user may achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. Further, specialized metals processing equipment is costly and requires high‑volume production to be cost effective. In addition, many customers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to efficiently and effectively perform metal processing for their own operations.  Due to this, many customers have reduced their in-house processing capabilities, opting to source processed metal from service centers like us.  This saves our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs, while permitting us to focus on value-added 
 4


services and increasing our fabrication mix. This supports our capital expenditures on processing equipment to grow annual gross profit margin. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. The majority of metals services companies have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price, and geographic proximity. We primarily compete with other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with metal producers.  
 The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Leading Market Position in North America. 
 Based on sales, we believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon, stainless steel, and aluminum in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with 91 facilities. 
 Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. 
 Broad Geographic Reach Across Attractive End Markets. 
 Our operations serve a diverse range of industries including commercial ground transportation, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable equipment, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing, and oil and gas. We believe this broad range of industries in which we sell our products and services reduces our risk related to a downturn in a specific industry. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. 
Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. 
 Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. Our strategies, include investing in value-added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, industry consolidation through targeted M&A, and providing customers faster and easier solutions to their metal needs, which we believe will provide us with growth opportunities. 
 Given the highly fragmented nature of the metals service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. In addition, due to our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can improve operating performance through efficiencies by integrating acquired businesses into our operational model, thus providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets, and broadening product mix. 
 Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. 
 Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses through tactical productivity and spending improvements.  In a stronger metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses. In 2021, although impacted by supply chain tightness, industry volumes improved compared to 2020. In response to increased volumes, our warehousing, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $156.9 million compared to 2020, but decreased as a percentage of sales by 350 basis points, illustrating our ability to manage cost pressures and realize expense leverage. 
 5


Throughout 2021, we continued to focus on and execute strong inventory management and had average inventory days excluding LIFO of 73 days in 2021, within our target inventory range. 
 Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. 
 We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other metals service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 40,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,100,000 orders per year. We provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery and value-added processing to many original equipment manufacturing customers. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 5% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for less than 13% of our sales. 
 Strong Relationships with Suppliers. 
 We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is effective for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. We focus on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs to drive value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills, we believe we have developed an advantageous global purchasing strategy. 
Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. 
 Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy. Our senior management has an average of more than 30 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and President, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and became CEO in June 2015, has 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Mr. Mike Burbach, our Chief Operating Officer, has over 38 years of experience with the Company and previously served as the President, North-West Region of the Company. Mr. Jim Claussen, Executive Vice President & CFO, has 27 years of industry experience. 
Industry Outlook 
 The Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) reported growth throughout 2021 with readings above 50%, indicating expansion in factory activity. This growth trend continued into 2022 with a reading of 57.6 for January. While PMI reported contraction in March, April, and May of 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., PMI has overall reported general economic expansion for the last three years as readings have exceeded 50% for 28 of the last 36 months. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries, and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. 
 Additionally, the Department of Commerce announced that real GDP increased 5.7 percent in 2021 and the Federal Reserve projected that the median growth rate in real GDP would be 4.0%, 2.2%, and 2.0% for 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. 
 Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance, and construction end markets. Our end markets are supported by the strength of the manufacturing economy, and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production is expected to have expanded by 5.5% in 2021 and is further expected to grow by 4.2% in 2022 and 2.8% in 2023. 
 Products and Services 
 We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are stocked in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals, and tubing.
 6


We also provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ needs. Most of the products that we carry require expensive specialized equipment for material handling and processing. We believe few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes, forms, or finishes or they are unwilling to incur the significant capital expenditures to acquire the necessary equipment. We are growing and diversifying our product mix mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy to provide increased levels of value-added processing services. We believe our enhanced processing capabilities will increase our ability to sell higher-margin metals processing services to a larger group of customers. We expect this, together and with our focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services, will increase our gross profit margin.
 We had capital expenditures of $194.6 million in the five-year period ended December 31, 2021. We are increasing our investments in processing equipment due to customers requesting higher levels of value-added processing.  We expect this to increase our profitability. We currently perform processing services on nearly 80% of the materials sold by us. 
 The following pie charts show our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2021 and 2020: 


We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification. See pie charts showing our sales by metal consuming industry within “Customers and Markets” discussion below.
 Customers and Markets 
 Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 40,000 in a variety of industries, including metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment, commercial ground transportation, consumer durable, food processing and agricultural equipment, construction equipment, and HVAC. Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturers, the majority of our sales are to smaller customers, including small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 5% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for approximately 13% of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.

The following pie charts show the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2021 and 2020: 

Our customers are primarily located throughout the United States, but we also have international customers. Most customers are located near one of our facilities, thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a high frequency of short lead time orders. We transport our products directly to customers via our in-house and dedicated truck fleet, which further supports the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, and via third-party trucking firms.
 We process our metals to specific customer orders as well as for stocking programs. Many of our larger customers commit to purchase on a regular basis at agreed upon or indexed prices for periods ranging from three to twelve months. To help mitigate price volatility risks, these price commitments are generally matched with corresponding supply arrangements, or to a lesser degree by commodity hedges. Customers notify us of specific release dates for processed products. Customers typically notify us of release dates anywhere from on a just-in-time basis to one month before the release date. Consequently, we are required to carry sufficient inventory to meet the short lead time and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. 
 We also have international facilities located in Canada, Mexico, and China.  Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for 9.7% of our consolidated 2021 net sales, or $551.6 million. See Note 14 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and assets.
 Customer demand may change from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. We believe that our various and diverse offerings, ways-to-markets, and end markets reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate, thus somewhat reducing earnings volatility.  A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in tonnage sold, in the months of July, November, and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters.
 Suppliers 
 We purchase the majority of our inventories from key domestic metals suppliers. Because of our total volume of purchases and our long‑term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top 25 suppliers, including their subcontractors, accounted for approximately 77% of our purchase dollars. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and there are several other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. While the metals producing supply base has experienced significant consolidation and supply interruptions during the past 
 8


year, we believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers has enabled us to meet our material requirements and will continue to allow us to do so in the future. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We maintain our own professional sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and offers a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staff, which together consist of approximately 800 employees, include technical personnel. Additionally, we offer our customers the ability to purchase our products through our e-commerce website.
 Because much of our business is relationship-based, we operate under many different trade names. Businesses we acquire often have strong customer relationships and solid reputations, and we will often continue to use the acquired business name to maintain existing customer relationships.
 Capital Expenditures 
 In 2021, we continued to focus on organic growth by expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment. Investments by us in property, plant, and equipment, together with asset retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2021, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $38.0 million. 

 | Additions | | Retirements or Sales | | | Net
-----+---------------+------+----------------------+---+------+----
 | (In millions) | 
2021 | $ | 59.3 | | $ | 68.5 | | (9.2 | )
2020 | | 26.0 | | | 0.2 | | 25.8 | 
2019 | | 45.8 | | | 57.5 | | (11.7 | )
2018 | | 38.4 | | | 5.5 | | 32.9 | 
2017 | | 25.1 | | | 24.9 | | 0.2 | 

 
The net reductions in 2019 and 2021 are related to sale lease-back transactions. See Part II, Item 8, Note 5: Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information on the 2021 sale-leaseback transactions. The lower amount of additions in 2020 was caused by maintenance capital expenditures deferred to 2021 as spending was reduced due to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $100 million for 2022, much of which is related to organic activities comprised of maintenance and purchases geared towards highly accretive growth projects. We expect nearly half of the 2022 capital expenditures to be funded using proceeds from the 2021 sale-leasebacks of two properties with the remainder funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. We will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project in light of the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment and may significantly reduce our capital expenditures if economic conditions warrant a more conservative approach to capital allocation. For the long term, we expect capital expenditures to normalize to a rate that approximates depreciation.
 Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters 
 Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure, and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements, or to pay for any investigations, corrective action, or claims. However, claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention, and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. 
 We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health, and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, and these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state, and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the 
 9


financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. 
 Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including costs of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages, or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation, remediation matters, or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned, operated, or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. At a December 4, 2018 meeting with the Portland Harbor Participation and Common Interest Group (“PCI Group”), of which JT Ryerson is a member, the EPA indicated that it expected PRPs to submit a plan during 2019 to start remediation of the river and harbor per the ROD within the next two to three years. The EPA also indicated that it expected allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same two to three-year time frame.
 The EPA met with various PRPs throughout 2019 and 2020 regarding remedial design. The EPA did not include JT Ryerson in those meetings.  It did include Schnitzer Steel, which is developing a remedial design plan for the river area which includes the area where the former JT Ryerson facilities were located. Schnitzer Steel’s 2020 disclosures filed with the EPA acknowledged that Schnitzer Steel is the legal successor to the prior operators (including JT Ryerson) in the designated area. On February 12, 2021, the EPA announced that one hundred percent (100%) of the PHS Site is now in the active remedial design phase. 
 In June 2021, the EPA issued a Fact Sheet setting forth the status of the entire site. The primary area of relevance for JT Ryerson is River Mile 3.5 East, with Swan Island Basin being of secondary interest. For River Mile 3.5, remedial design work is ongoing; the Sufficiency Assessment and the Pre-Design Investigation work plans are finalized, and design investigation sampling is underway. Schnitzer Steel and MMGL Corp. are the working parties for River Mile 3.5. For Swan Island, remedial design is just beginning, with Daimler Trucks, Shipyard Commerce, and various government entities as the working parties. JT Ryerson has not been asked to participate in the remedial design phase. 
 The PCI Group has engaged a third party to prepare cost estimates for each of the Sediment Management Areas at the site. That work is still in progress and is expected to be completed in early 2022. Once the cost estimates are completed, the voting parties of the PCI Group (which does not include JT Ryerson) will likely begin the “advocacy process,” during which the voting parties submit written arguments to the Allocation Team regarding how costs should be allocated among the various PRPs. This process is anticipated to be completed sometime in 2022. Once the advocacy process is completed, the Allocation Team will prepare a proposed allocation of costs among the PRPs. All PRPs, including JT Ryerson, will then participate in the “mediation process,” during which the PRPs will attempt to agree on a final cost allocation. The mediation process is currently anticipated to occur sometime in 2022 or 2023. 
 The EPA has stated that it is willing to consider de minimis settlements, which JT Ryerson is trying to pursue; however, the EPA has not begun meeting with any of the smaller parties who have requested de minimis or de micromis status, stating that it does not have sufficient information to determine whether any parties meet such criteria and does not intend to begin those considerations until after the remedial design work is completed. It has met with selected parties that we believe to be larger targets. JT Ryerson has not been invited to meet with the EPA. As a result of the ongoing negotiations and filings over the ROD and the EPA’s decision not to meet with smaller parties, we cannot determine how allocations will be made and whether a de minimus settlement can be reached with the EPA. 
 As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. 
 There are various other claims and pending actions against the Company. The amount of liability, if any, for those claims and actions as of December 31, 2021 is not determinable but, in the opinion of management, such liability, if any, will not have a material 
 10


adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We maintain liability insurance coverage to assist in protecting our assets from losses arising from or related to activities associated with business operations. 
 Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and we vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole. 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Ryerson is committed to operating with a high level of integrity. We are driven by our dedication to support our employees and the communities we serve, deliver products that meet our stringent quality and compliance standards, and maintain high environmental, health, and safety standards to protect our people and the places where we operate. We work to continually improve each of these areas to make Ryerson an even better company for tomorrow.
 Below are some highlights of our corporate responsibility programs.
Sustainability
 As part of our efforts to operate with a high level of integrity, we continuously monitor and analyze ourselves and our supply-chain relationships.  We strive, and expect our suppliers, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and Ryerson's Human Rights Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy, and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.
 We are committed to mitigating the impact our operations and products have on the environment. As an operator of metals service centers, our day-to-day business consists of the sale, distribution, and processing of a broad variety of metal products sourced from numerous primary metal producers. Our operations, by their nature, do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Further, according to the Steel Recycling Institute, we believe steel, one of our most significant products, is the most recycled material on the planet—more than plastic, paper, and glass combined each year—which provides a strong foundation for our sustainability efforts. The Steel Recycling Institute notes that two out of every three tons of new steel are produced from old steel. As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, we:
  
• | Sell carbon, steel, and aluminum, which are 100% recyclable and can be recycled many times over to create new products without loss of quality
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Purchase significant volumes of metal that have been produced using recycled materials or scrap melted in Electric Arc Furnaces
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Source most of our steel from North American metal producers, which have substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other world producers
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sell scrap material generated in our operations to recyclers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Work with our customers to reduce carbon emissions throughout their value chain
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also use propane fuel to operate forklifts, have installed energy efficient lighting in many of our facilities, and utilize energy efficient diesel tractors that consume less fuel and reduce emissions for the majority of our trucking fleet to further mitigate our impact on the environment.

Community & Social Vitality
 Being a responsible neighbor and helping build better communities in the areas we operate is a central part of our company culture. We understand that supporting our communities through giving back is an important and increasing interest of our current and future employees.
 Employees are provided the opportunity to volunteer their time in the communities they call home through the Ryerson Gives Back program. Established in 2017, Ryerson Gives Back encourages teams across the Company to volunteer in their community, allotting four paid volunteer hours annually to each employee. From food banks to local construction projects, we have watched employees step up to support underserved groups and areas on behalf of Ryerson.
 In addition to giving back, we encourage employees to exercise their civic responsibilities. Employees were granted an additional four hours of paid time off to vote in the 2020 presidential election. We also support various charitable organizations, including those that promote social justice and equality, good health, children's causes, educational advancement, and community programs.
 Human Capital
 In order to provide best in class customer experiences, it is crucial that we continue to work to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. 
 Employees. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,700 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,600 office employees and approximately 2,100 plant employees. Seventeen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
 Five renewal contracts covering 100 employees were successfully negotiated in 2021. Four contracts covering 104 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2022.
 Employee Development & Engagement. Ryerson believes in promoting from within and provides the resources for long-term career development.  Our summer internship program and Ryerson Academy provide meaningful training to entry-level employees.  Ryerson Academy is a unique, 12-week immersive training program that runs three sessions per year for entry-level inside sales associates. The program provides intensive training and experience in sales and customer service with up to 15 participants in each session. Ryerson Academy also teaches critical communication, negotiation, and presentation skills, and participants regularly interact with Ryerson’s senior leadership and subject matter experts. 
 For decades, we have supported the continuing education of our employees’ families through a college scholarship program. In 2021, as part of this program, we awarded almost $32,000 in academic scholarships to students graduating from high school that are children or dependents of Ryerson employees. We also support the continuing education of our employees through tuition reimbursement programs.
 We have a robust training platform, Ryerson EDvantage, available to all employees which offers Ryerson product training along with general skills courses that are customized for our employees’ development.  We focus on succession planning and ensure that proper cross-training and knowledge transfer is in place. 
 Our commitment to listening to and working with our employees led to the launch of our company-wide engagement survey in 2018. Using Quantum Workplace, a leading engagement survey software, our employees anonymously provided their perspectives on a variety of topics. Ryerson achieved overall favorability of 67% with a participation rate of nearly 80%, which exceeded industry benchmarks. We distributed the results to our department heads and managers to hold team meetings to discuss the outcomes and gain additional insights. We identified key improvement opportunities and established advisory teams to address them. In early 2020, we conducted a follow-up “pulse” survey with a subset of the organization and, encouragingly, found that favorability scores increased in locations where leaders had worked to affect change. From this collective effort came company-wide initiatives including new health and wellness programs and improved sick, vacation, and parental leave policies for U.S. employees. 
 Diversity and Inclusion. Ryerson is dedicated to building a diverse workplace of associates from a variety of cultures, educational backgrounds, and life experiences. A well-rounded community of talent helps cultivate new ideas and perspectives that help the Company expand its thinking and refine its practices and processes to continue growing in a smart way. Ryerson is aggressively working to engage diverse and under-represented individuals through its recruiting efforts in diverse and underserved communities. We have a Diversity & Inclusion Council whose mission is to foster an environment across the organization that values

diversity of experiences and perspectives and encourages inclusivity in all aspects of the business. Only by respecting each of our unique perspectives, experiences, and needs can we unlock the full potential of our workforce and attract the best talent. The council seeks to achieve this through:
  
• | Developing cultural competence and responsiveness as an organization,

 We promote the advancement of women in our organization through our Women’s Sponsorship Program which provides sponsorship of women in various levels and positions throughout the organization. Ryerson’s employees also participate in Association of Women in the Metals Industry membership and events. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, we adopted a new parental leave policy which provides all U.S. non-union, full-time employees with four weeks of fully paid parental leave plus eight weeks of fully paid maternity leave. 
 From a governance perspective, Ryerson has adopted a Code of Ethics & Business Conduct, a Board Corporate Governance Guidelines and Nominating Corporate Governance Committee Charter, an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, and Anti-harassment Policy to support our diversity, equity, and inclusion values. Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee provide oversight of our policies, programs, and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.
 Employee Safety.  Upholding a safe workplace is one of our core values and a part of the company's culture. Our safety standards, which go beyond the minimum requirements required by applicable law, have helped protect the well-being of our people and prevent workplace injuries that can impact business productivity. We continuously work to maintain a safety performance rating that consistently outperforms the industry average and have implemented an Environmental, Health, and Safety policy that reinforces the goal of a zero-injury workplace. Our low recordable injury rate compared to our peers in the metal services industry, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. Our 2021 performance at our facilities, measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 2.08, which was better than the industry average as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Health and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interests of our employees and the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, such as having office employees work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
 Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the financial needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, we provide annual and quarterly sales incentive plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, retirement savings contribution matching, paid time off, parental and maternity leave, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. Additionally, we have targeted equity-based grant programs with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical skills and experience.
