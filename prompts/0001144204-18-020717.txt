ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market. Our products are sold by our in-house, regional sales teams, our customer service group, and authorized independent sales representatives to a network of over 1,200 North American safety and mill supply distributors. These distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers, such as integrated oil, chemical/petrochemical, utilities, automobile, steel, glass, construction, smelting, munition plants, janitorial, pharmaceutical, mortuaries and high technology electronics manufacturers, as well as scientific and medical laboratories. In addition, we supply federal, state and local governmental agencies and departments, such as fire and law enforcement, airport crash rescue units, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control. Internationally, sales are to a mixture of end users directly and to industrial distributors depending on the particular country and market. Sales are made to more than 40 countries, the bulk of which were into China, European Economic Community (“EEC”), Canada, Chile, Argentina, Russia, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Southeast Asia. For purposes of this Form 10-K, FY refers to a fiscal year ended January 31; for example, FY18 refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. In FY18 we had net sales of $96.0 million and $86.2 million in FY17.
 
For the first half of the year, economic growth and investment globally was mixed as manufacturing indexes and purchasing manager’s indexes fluctuated month to month regionally before finally turning positive around the globe at mid-year. Compounding the problems in the first half of the year was the new US administration’s mixed signals on their intentions on the continuation of existing policies on critical issues like taxes, regulation, immigration, and trade policy. These issues caused more uncertainty for manufacturers and distributors who were already being conservative in their commitments to inventories and investment. This in turn limited growth opportunities while leading to more aggressive pricing from the competition which had to be met. Fortunately, however, the during the second half of the fiscal year, global talks commenced between the US administration and foreign leaders and, with some doubt removed, the economy began to strengthen. In addition, significant cost-cutting was proactively taken in the US in the first quarter of FY17 - as management believed uncertainty in the year to come would likely stifle revenue growth year- and this provided a cushion that protected margins.
 
The Company recognizes the need to grow faster than what just organic growth from existing product lines and market segments will contribute, so it has accelerated product development, is pressing ahead aggressively with the rollout of new products, is proceeding with the addition of field personnel to increase sales in our target industrial sectors, and is entering new sectors where we see opportunity.

Additionally, a major strategic companywide objective to accelerate growth throughout the Company is to push additional products and sales tools that are successful in the key US and China markets to the other international operations, which have traditionally carried smaller lines. To facilitate this, the Company is also aggressively hiring more sales people world-wide as well as upgrading marketing. The idea is to better leverage product and marketing assets Companywide, thereby promoting more consistent product line offerings and global branding.
 
As always, the cornerstone of the Company’s strategy is the belief that owning and operating its own factories for the bulk of production is a key advantage in terms of control of costs, quality, delivery times, and a unique ability to rapidly respond to emergency situations by being able to scale up almost instantly, compared to the competition that relies almost exclusively on third party contractors who usually service multiple companies.
 
Industry Overview
 
The industrial work clothing market includes our limited use/disposable protective or safety clothing, our high-end chemical protective suits, our firefighting and heat protective apparel, gloves and our reusable woven garments.
 
The industrial protective safety clothing market in the United States has evolved over the past 48 years as a result of governmental regulations and requirements and commercial product development. In 1970, Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, which requires employers to supply protective clothing in certain work environments. Certain states have also enacted worker safety laws that further supplement OSHA standards and requirements.
 
The advent of OSHA coincided with the development of light disposable fabrics, such as SMS (a three layered nonwoven) and Polypropylene which, for the first time, allowed for the economical production of lightweight, disposable protective clothing. The attraction of disposable garments grew in the late 1970s as a result of increases in labor and material costs of producing cloth garments and the promulgation of federal, state and local safety regulations. Also, in order to comply with World Trade Organization (“WTO”) entry requirements, foreign countries are beginning to adopt and imitate OSHA regulations, American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and Committee European de Normalization (“CE”) standards. Thus, these developing international markets are growing much more rapidly than the US markets.
 
International and Domestic Standards
 
Standards development, within both the US and global markets, continues to challenge manufacturers as the pace of change and adoption of new standards increase. Complex and changing international standards play to Lakeland’s strengths when compared to most multinationals or smaller manufacturers. Lakeland currently sits on boards and/or works closely with groups involved in writing many international standards such as the American Society for Testing and Materials International (“ASTM”), the National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”), International Safety Equipment Association (“ISEA”) in the US, the European Committee for Standardization (“CEN”), the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) in Europe, the China National Standards Board (“GB”) in China, and the Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand (“ASNZ”) in Australia and New Zealand.
 
Globally, not only are the standards continuing to change at a rapid pace, but the focus of standards activity is shifting. In response to increasing use of certification processes as a technical barrier to trade, standards writing bodies in the US and Europe have both concluded efforts to update and define conformity assessment (ANSI/ISEA 125 and the PPE Regulation respectively) within their own spheres of influence, unfortunately, these are not “international standards” and can be easily ignored by other countries who wish to impose their own conformity assessment systems on importers. The result is an increasingly dynamic standards environment where not only are the standards changing, but the minimum requirements for conformity with the certification process itself are changing.
 
A number of developing nations are now becoming active in their own standards development based on existing international standards. However, we believe that the primary goal of their standards writing activity is not focused on worker protection (that is provided for by the use of international standards), rather they are attempting to establish their own certification criteria that will protect their domestic markets or favor specific regional suppliers. This presents a new challenge in that now not only are we faced with multiple test methods and standards, but we have the potential for multiple certification processes. While this adds to product development and sales expenses, the additional cost is only incremental. The real challenge is in navigating the certification process itself. Lakeland, by virtue of its international manufacturing and sales operations, is in a unique position to capitalize on this complex dynamic.

Business Strategy
 
Key elements of our strategy include:
 

· | Increase International Sales Opportunities. In the past, we aggressively increased our penetration of the international markets for our product lines. Starting in FY07 and through FY08, we opened sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Weifang, China; Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina and in FY11, we opened sales offices in Russia, India and Kazakhstan. The Company acquired Qualytextil (later identified herein as Lakeland Brazil), a Brazilian manufacturer, in FY09, with the intent of penetrating this market but due to extreme challenges transferred the shares of this subsidiary to an officer of that company on July 31, 2015. We continue to believe in this strategy of aggressively penetrating international markets. Aiding our focus is the fact that many countries have adopted legislation similar to the 1970 US OSHA in order to facilitate their entry into the WTO which has, as a requisite for entry, worker safety laws (like OSHA), social security, environmental and tax laws similar to that of the USA and Europe. These new worker safety laws have driven the demand for our products in these growing economies.

· | Improve Marketing in Existing Markets. We believe significant growth opportunities are available to us through the better positioning, marketing and enhanced cross-selling of our reusable woven protective clothing, glove and arm guards, reflective clothing, high-end chemical suit product lines and our limited use/disposable lines as a bundled offering. This allows our customers one-stop shopping using combined freight shipments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continued Emphasis on Customer Service. We continue to offer a high level of customer service to distinguish our products and to create customer loyalty. We offer well-trained and experienced sales and support personnel, on-time delivery and accommodation of custom and rush orders. We also seek to advertise our Lakeland branded tradenames and trademarks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Introduce New Products; Focus on Energy Sector. We continued our history of product development and innovation by introducing new proprietary products across all our product lines. Our innovations have included Micromax® disposable protective clothing line, our ChemMax® line of chemical protective clothing, several patented glove designs, superior quality innovative products protecting against electrical hazards, and industry-leading fire suit designs. We own 17 patents on fabrics and production machinery, with two foreign applications in process, and continue to work on developing fabrics that could potentially lead us into new markets and channels. In North America, our growth strategy is to focus on key target sectors where we have advantages, and to increase our involvement at the end user level by adding sales personnel and enhancing our marketing and product training tools to make it easier for the sales teams of our distributors to be successful promoting our products. Though the Energy sector has been down and exploration and field development is greatly reduced, low oil prices are giving refineries the opportunity to go off line after several years of high prices and running at full capacity and perform long-deferred maintenance. It is worth noting that the decline in oil prices has not affected demand in the downstream (refining and distribution) portion of the oil business, which is where the majority of our sector sales occur. The Company continues to experience demand growth in the utility industry- both electric and gas- for our Reflective clothing division. The reflective division is already a steadily growing area for Lakeland, as we add new fire resistant (“FR”), static dissipative and arc flash protective garments, and as OSHA enforces broader requirements for their use, we expect to see continued growth. The recent investment in a stronger sales team in Mexico is beginning to pay off with sales growth as the impact of low oil prices on the gas industry is offset by strong growth in manufacturing, particularly noticeable in the number of new automobile factories located in that country. We believe that as this growth continues and as oil prices recover, Mexico will become a very important region for the Company, building on our competitive advantage of local manufacturing, provided that NAFTA and trade issues do no cause disruptions. We have integrated the US, Canadian, and Mexican sales teams into one coordinated unit, a strategic recognition that the three countries are increasingly part of a great North American market with inter-related industries and companies throughout, and our sales teams are sharing opportunities with each other. We have experienced situations in which we could not break through with a company in one country, but the team in another country was able to get in and make a conversion to our products. Then, after successful use of our products in that one country, the doors open to us in the other. We continue to pursue conversions to our products from DuPont product end users, based on our overall performance and prices. We believe the inevitable disruptions to DuPont surrounding its proposed mega merger with Dow Chemical, followed by planned spin offs over the next several years, gives us additional openings for which we are gearing up to take advantage. Our marketing is being significantly upgraded in terms of resources applied, more and better collateral materials, and increasingly effective use of social media. An example of this is an on-going Fire Division campaign driven by Lakeland sponsorships of several top-ranked participants in the “Combat Challenge” (an international skills and fitness competition) that netted significant numbers of followers, who as a result expressed interest in our gear. Similar campaigns are being planned for other product lines, including to support the adoption of an exclusive new proprietary technology that we believe may have a significant impact on how end users select chemical suits and suppliers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Decrease Manufacturing Expenses by Moving Production to International Facilities. We continued to identify opportunities to take advantage of our low cost production capabilities in China and Mexico. Beginning in 1995, we successfully moved the labor-intensive sewing operation for our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines to facilities in Mexico and China. More recently we have initiated startup manufacturing operations in Vietnam, which is still under development, and India to offset increasing manufacturing costs in China. Our China operations will continue operations primarily manufacturing for the Chinese market and other markets where duty advantages exist. Manufacturing expansion is not only necessary to control rising costs, it is also necessary for Lakeland to achieve its growth objectives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We continue to press our raw material and component suppliers for price reductions and better payment terms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are sourcing more raw materials and components from our China based operations as opposed to sourcing from Europe and North America.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are re-engineering many products to reduce the amount of raw materials used and reduce the direct labor required.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Our competitive strengths include:
 

· | Industry Reputation. We devote significant resources to creating customer loyalty and brand integrity by accommodating custom and rush orders and focusing on on-time delivery. Additionally, our ISO 9001 and 9002 certified facilities manufacture high-quality products. As a result of these factors, we believe that we have an excellent reputation in the industry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Manufacturing Capabilities. We have operated our own manufacturing facilities in Mexico since 1995 and in China since 1996. Our facilities in China in FY18 totaled 177,316 sq. ft. of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space, and our facility in Mexico totaled 74,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space. Our facilities and capabilities in China and Mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the US and permits us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than are available domestically.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Sales Offices. We have sales offices around the world to service various major markets, including offices in Toronto, Canada; Hull, UK; Beijing, Weifang, Chongqing and Shanghai, China; Australia; Southeast Asia; Santiago, Chile; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Jerez, Mexico; Moscow, Russia; and Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Comprehensive Inventory. We have a large product offering with numerous specifications, such as size, styles and pockets, and maintain a large inventory of each in order to satisfy customer orders in a timely manner. Many of our customers traditionally make purchases of industrial protective gear with expectations of immediate delivery. We believe our ability to provide timely service for these customers enhances our reputation in the industry and positions us strongly for repeat business, particularly in our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manufacturing Flexibility. By locating labor-intensive manufacturing processes, such as sewing, in Mexico, China, Vietnam, which is under development, and India and by utilizing sewing subcontractors, we have the ability to increase production without substantial additional capital expenditures. Our manufacturing systems allow us flexibility for unexpected production surges and alternative capacity in the event any of our independent contractors become unavailable.

Limited Use/Disposable Protective Clothing
 
We manufacture a complete line of limited use/disposable protective garments, including coveralls, laboratory coats, shirts, pants, hoods, aprons, sleeves, arm guards, caps and smocks. Limited use garments can also be coated or laminated to increase splash protection against harmful inorganic acids, bases and other hazardous liquid and dry chemicals. Limited use garments are made from several nonwoven fabrics, including our premium lines, our own trademarked fabrics, such as Pyrolon® Plus 2, XT, Micromax®, Micromax NS, Safegard®, Zonegard®, and ChemMax® 1 and 2, which are made of spunlaced polyester, polypropylene, laminates, microporous films and derivatives. We incorporate many seaming, heat sealing and taping techniques depending on the level of protection needed in the end use application.

Typical users of these garments include integrated oil/petrochemical refineries, chemical plants and related installations, automotive manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, construction companies, coal, gas and oil power generation utilities and telephone utility companies, laboratories, mortuaries and governmental entities. Numerous smaller industries use these garments for specific safety applications unique to their businesses. Additional applications include protection from viruses and bacteria, such as AIDS, streptococcus, SARS and hepatitis, at international hospitals, clinics and emergency rescue sites and use in clean room environments to prevent human contamination in the manufacturing processes.
 
Our limited use/disposable protective clothing products range in unit price from $0.19 for shoe covers to approximately $6.00-$14.40 for a light duty ChemMax® 1 serged or sealed seam laminated hood and booted coverall. Our largest selling item, a standard white Micromax NS ANSI standard or CE standard coverall, sells for approximately $2.00 to $3.85 per garment. By comparison, similar reusable cloth coveralls range in price from $35.00 to $93.00, exclusive of laundering, maintenance and shrinkage expenses.
 
We warehouse and sell our limited use/disposable garments primarily at our Alabama and China manufacturing facilities and secondarily from warehouses in Hull, United Kingdom; Toronto, Canada; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Jerez, Mexico; Moscow, Russia; Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan; Houston, Texas; and Las Vegas, Nevada. The fabric is cut and sewn into required patterns at our one Chinese and one Mexican plant and shipped to all our sales points around the world. Our assembly facilities in China and Mexico cut, sew and package the finished garments and return them primarily to our Alabama plant, normally within 1 to 10 weeks, for immediate shipment to our North American customers.
 
High-End Chemical Protective Suits
 
We manufacture and sell heavy duty protective chemical suits and protective apparel from our proprietary CRFR, ChemMax® 3, 4, Interceptor and other fabrics. These suits are worn by individuals on hazardous material teams and within general industry to provide protection from powerful, highly concentrated and hazardous or potentially lethal chemical and biological toxins, such as toxic wastes at Superfund sites, toxic chemical spills or biological discharges, chemical or biological warfare weapons (such as sarin, anthrax or ricin and mustard gas) and chemicals and petro-chemicals present during the cleaning of refineries and nuclear facilities and protection from infectious disease agents such as Bird Flu and Ebola. Our line of chemical protective clothing ranges in price from about $22 to $1,340 per garment. The chemical suits can be used in conjunction with a fire protective shell that we manufacture to protect the user from both chemical and flash fire hazards. We have also introduced two patented garments approved by the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) for varying levels of protection:

· | Interceptor®, two multilayer films laminated on either side of durable nonwoven substrate. This garment provides a broad spectrum chemical barrier to gases, vapors and liquids. This garment is of an encapsulating design and is available in CE Type 1 certified configurations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ChemMax® 4 is a multilayer barrier film laminated to a durable nonwoven substrate. This garment is a broad spectrum chemical barrier, but its greatest advantage is that the material is strong enough to hold an airtight zipper and to withstand reuse. As a result, it provides a low cost option for encapsulating garments and is durable enough for multiple reuse provided the garment is not exposed to chemical hazards. It is available in CE type 4 and 3 certified garments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The addition of Interceptor and ChemMax® 4 to our product line provides Lakeland with, we believe, the most complete and cost-effective line of chemical protective garments available on the market today. Garments are certified to NFPA standards where applicable in the Americas, and versions of all of these garments are also CE certified for European and Pan Asian markets.
 
We manufacture higher end chemical protective clothing with taped seams at our facilities in Mexico and China with light manufacturing in Alabama. Using fabrics, such as ChemMax® 1, ChemMax® 2, ChemMax® 3, ChemMax® 4 and Interceptor, we design, cut, sew and seal these materials to meet customer purchase orders.
 
Firefighting and Heat Protective Apparel
 
We manufacture an extensive line of UL/NFPA-certified structured firefighter protective apparel for domestic and foreign fire departments, available both in standard stock form and custom configurations.

-

 

We offer basic firefighter turnout/bunker gear in the Attack (A10) and Battalion (B1) styles. Introduced in 2013 are the Battalion (“B2”) style with advanced ergonomic features and the Stealth style, with innovative features new to the fire industry.
 
We also manufacture each of the above styles in our UL/NFPA-certified Proximity line for Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (“ARFF”) with aluminized shells.
 
We manufacture full lines of Fire service extrication suits in FR cotton, UL/NFPA-certified Wild land firefighting apparel in multiple fabrics and Aluminized Kiln entry/Approach suits to protect industrial workers from extreme heat.
 
We manufacture fire suits at our facilities in China, Mexico and Alabama. Our fire suits range in price from about $800 for standard fire department turnout gear to $2,000 for custom gear. Our Lakeland Fire® brand of firefighting apparel continues to benefit from ongoing research and development investment, as we seek to address the ergonomic needs of stressful occupations.
 
Reusable Woven Garments
 
We manufacture and market a line of reusable and washable woven garments that complement our firefighting and heat protective apparel offerings and provide alternatives to our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines and give us access to the much larger woven industrial and health care-related markets. Cloth reusable garments are favored by customers for certain uses or applications because of familiarity with and acceptance of these fabrics and woven cloth’s heavier weight, durability, longevity and comfort. These products allow us to supply and satisfy a wider range of safety and customer needs.
 
Our product lines include the following:
 

· | Electrostatic dissipative apparel used by electric and gas utilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flame resistant Nomex®/FR and FR Cotton coveralls/pants/jackets used in petrochemical and refining operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cotton and Polycotton coveralls, lab coats, pants and shirts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our reusable woven garments range in price from $30 to $200 per garment. We manufacture woven cloth garments at our facilities in China, Mexico and Argentina. We are continuing to relocate highly repetitive sewing processes for our high volume, standard product lines, such as woven protective coveralls and fire retardant coveralls, to our facilities in China and Mexico where lower fabric and labor costs allow increased profit margins.
 
High Visibility Clothing
 
Lakeland Reflective manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of reflective apparel meeting the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements. The line includes vests, T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, coats, raingear, jumpsuits, hats and gloves.
 
Fabrics available, including solid and mesh fluorescent, polyester, both standard and FR treated, Modacrylic materials, which meet ASTM 1560 Test method for standard 70 Electric Arc Protection, are part of our offering. The breathable Modacrylic fabric, that we introduced last year, has fabric that has a strong appeal in states where very hot weather affects utility workers working outside during spring and summer (heat prostration).
 
Our High Vis Polyurethane FR/ARC rated rainwear is light in weight, soft, flexible and provides a breathable, cooler garment. This product is intended for the Gas and Electrical Utility markets. The Lakeland ARC TECH FR/PU garment exceeds all of the required ASTM ARC and Flash fire ratings for the large Electric and Gas Utility market.
 
Our domestic vest production occurs in our facilities in Mexico and China with light manufacturing in Alabama and is focused on custom vest requirements. Many corporations and agencies, such as State Departments of Transportation, develop custom specifications which they feel are more efficient in meeting their specific needs versus an off-the-shelf product. We also can import a significant amount of product from China and Mexico to meet the demand for items in high volume commodity markets.
 
In addition to ANSI Reflective items, Lakeland Hi-Visibility manufactures Nomex and FR cotton garments which have reflective trim as a part of their design criteria. These garments typically are used in rescue operations, such as those encountered with a vehicular crash. Garments in this group are not as price sensitive as those in the reflective categories. Consequently, they are made in our facilities in Mexico and China with light manufacturing in Alabama facility where we can react to customized needs and offer quicker customer response. Garments in this group can range in price from $200 to $360.

Gloves and Sleeves
 
We manufacture and sell specially designed glove and sleeve protective products made from Kevlar®, a cut and heat resistant fiber produced by DuPont, Spectra®, a cut resistant fiber made by Honeywell and our proprietary patented engineered yarns. We are one of only nine companies licensed in North America to sell 100% Kevlar® gloves, which are high strength, lightweight, flexible and durable. Kevlar® gloves offer a better overall level of protection and lower worker injury rate, and are more cost effective than traditional leather, canvas or coated work gloves. Kevlar® gloves, which can withstand temperatures of up to 400°F and are cut resistant enough to allow workers to safely handle sharp or jagged unfinished sheet metal, are used primarily in the automotive, glass and metal fabrication industries. Our higher end string knit gloves range in price from about $40 to $175 for a dozen pair. We manufacture these string knit gloves primarily at our Mexican facility, enabling lower production and labor costs.
 
We have received patents for our Despro® and Despro® Plus products on manufacturing processes that provide greater cut and abrasion hand protection to the areas of a glove where it wears out prematurely in various applications. For example, the areas of the thumb crotch and index fingers are made heavier than the balance of the glove, providing increased wear protection and longer glove life, reducing overall glove costs. This proprietary manufacturing process allows us, we believe, to produce our gloves more economically and provide a greater value to our end user.
 
Quality
 
All of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001 or 9002 certified. ISO standards are internationally recognized quality manufacturing standards established by the International Organization for Standardization based in Geneva, Switzerland. To obtain our ISO registration, our factories were independently audited to test our compliance with the applicable standards. In order to maintain registration, our factories receive regular announced inspections by an independent certification organization. While ISO certification is advantageous in retaining CE certification of products, we believe that the ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 certifications make us more competitive in the marketplace, as customers increasingly recognize the standard as an indication of product quality.
 
As we are increasingly sourcing fabrics internationally, we installed a quality control laboratory at our China facility. This laboratory is critical for ensuring that our incoming raw materials meet our quality requirements, and we continue to add new capabilities to this facility to further guarantee product quality and to aid in new product development.
 
We have also added a new test lab in Decatur, Alabama. This lab was completed in FY16 and will be the primary facility to pre-test all NFPA certified garments. This lab includes an industrial washer and dryer, home washer and dryer, shower tester, Martindale abrasion tester, Crestron microscope, flame cabinet, and convection oven. This lab will ensure that garments submitted to Underwriter’s Laboratories (“UL”) for certification are assured to pass certification, thus reducing overall certification costs. 
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Domestically, we employ a field sales force in order to better support customers and enhance marketing. We further leverage our in-house sales team with 60 independent sales representatives. These employees and representatives call on over 1,000 industrial safety and fire service distributors nationwide to promote and sell our products. Distributors buy our products for resale and typically maintain inventory at the local level in order to assure quick response times and the ability to serve their customers properly. Our sales employees and independent representatives have consistent communication with end users and decision makers at the distribution level, thereby allowing us valuable feedback on market perception of our products, as well as information about new developments in our industry.
 
As a key competitive and marketing advantage, we manufacture nearly all the garments we sell in our own factories for better control of costs, quality and delivery. Our competitors rely largely on contractors, which is a major selling point in our favor, as customers are more comfortable dealing with the actual manufacturer. 
 
We seek to maximize the efficiency of our established distribution network through direct promotion of our products at the end user level. We advertise primarily through trade publications, and our promotional activities include sales brochures, emails and our website. We exhibit at both regional and national trade shows, such as the National Safety Congress, the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE), the CIOSH, the COS+H and the A+A show in Dusseldorf, Germany.

Product line expansion to higher value products is progressing in all global markets and is contributing to increased brand recognition, sales growth and profitability. We believe that future international growth is still sustainable in the coming year, based on our current estimates of market penetration, the introduction of higher value products and the opportunity to open new markets in which we do not yet have a presence.
 
Lakeland has salespeople in 18 countries outside of the US and product sales in 40 or more countries. Internationally, our sustainable market advantages continue to be our knowledge of global standards, the diversity of our product offering and the fact that we manufacture our own products. This provides our customers with high level product selection, quality, delivery and customer service. There are no customers who accounted for 10% of sales or more in FY18, FY17, and in FY16.
 
Suppliers and Materials
 
Our largest supplier was Precision Fabrics Group from whom we purchased 10.5%, 13% and 9.5% of our total purchases in FY18, FY17 and FY16. We do not have long-term, formal trademark use agreements with any other suppliers of nonwoven fabric raw materials used by us in the production of our limited use/disposable protective clothing product lines. Materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, spunlaced polyester, melt blown polypropylene and their derivatives and laminates, are available from 30 or more major mills. FR fabrics are also available from a number of both domestic and international mills. The accessories used in the production of our disposable garments, such as thread, boxes, snaps and elastics, are obtained from unaffiliated suppliers. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining our requirements for these commodity component items.
 
We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining materials, including cotton, polyester and nylon, used in the production of reusable nonwovens and commodity gloves. We obtain Honeywell Spectra® yarn, used in our super cut-resistant Dextra Guard gloves, and Kevlar®, used in the production of our specialty safety gloves, from independent mills that purchase the fibers from DuPont.
 
Materials used in our fire and heat protective suits include glass fabric, aluminized glass, Nomex®, aluminized Nomex®, Kevlar®, aluminized Kevlar® and polybenzimidazole, as well as combinations utilizing neoprene coatings. Traditional chemical protective suits are made of Viton®, butyl rubber and polyvinyl chloride, all of which are available from multiple sources. Advanced chemical protective suits are made from our proprietary ChemMax® 1, 2, 3, 4 and Interceptor®. We have not experienced difficulty obtaining any of these materials.
 
Competition
 
Our business is highly competitive due to large competitors who have monopolistic positions in the fabrics that are standards in the industry in disposable and high-end chemical suits. We believe that the barriers to entry in the reusable garments and gloves industries are relatively low. We face competition in some of our other product markets from large established companies that have greater financial, research and development, sales and technical resources. Where larger competitors, such as DuPont, Kimberly Clark, Ansell Edmont and Honeywell, offer products that are directly competitive with our products, particularly as part of an established line of products, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete for sales and customers. Larger competitors outside of our Disposable and Chemical Suit Lines also may be able to benefit from economies of scale and technological innovation and may introduce new products that compete with our products.

Seasonality
 
Our operations have historically been moderately seasonal, with higher sales generally occurring in March, April and May when scheduled maintenance on nuclear, coal, oil and gas fired utilities, chemical, petrochemical and smelting facilities, and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants occurs, primarily due to moderate spring temperatures and low Energy demands. Sales decline during the warmer summer vacation months and gradually increase from Labor Day through February with slight declines during holidays, such as Christmas. As a result of this seasonality in our sales, we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital, specifically inventories, with peak inventories occurring between December and May, coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules. We believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory, we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices, delivery times and quality standards differ.
 
In recent years, due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear, our historical seasonal pattern has shifted. Governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns. Due to the size and timing of these governmental orders, our net sales, results of operations, working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods. As a result, we expect to experience increased variability in net sales, net income, working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We own 17 patents and have four patents in the application and approval process with the US Patent and Trademark Office. We own 31 Trademarks and have 22 Trademarks in the application and approval process. Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets, trademarks and, to a lesser extent, copyrights. We maintain an active program to protect our technology by ensuring respect for our intellectual property rights.
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2018, we had 1,072 full-time employees, 976, or 91%, of who were employed in our international facilities, and 96, or 9%, of who were employed in our domestic facilities. An aggregate of approximately 790 of international employees are members of unions in their respective countries. We are not currently a party to any collective bargaining agreements or any other contracts with these unions. We believe our employee relations to be excellent.
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection, chemical control, and health and safety laws and regulations, and we incur costs to comply with those laws. We own and lease real property, and certain environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property responsible for contamination on or originating from property, even if they did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. The presence of hazardous substances on any of our properties or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements could affect our ability to use or to sell the property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing, and could result in substantial remediation or compliance costs.
 
Although we have not in the past had any material costs or damages associated with environmental claims or compliance, and we do not currently anticipate any such costs or damages, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur material costs or damages in the future as a result of the discovery of new facts or conditions, acquisition of new properties, the release of hazardous substances, a change in interpretation of existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws.
