Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (“Hamilton Beach Holding” or the “Company”) is an operating holding company for two separate businesses: consumer, commercial and specialty small appliances and specialty retail. Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. (“HBB”) is a leading designer, marketer and distributor of branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliances as well as commercial products for restaurants, bars and hotels. The Kitchen Collection, LLC (“KC”) is a national specialty retailer of kitchenware operating retail stores in outlet and traditional malls throughout the United States. Results of operations and financial condition are discussed separately by segment, which corresponds with the industry groupings. 
On September 29, 2017, NACCO Industries, Inc. ("NACCO"), Hamilton Beach Holding's former parent company, spun-off the Company to NACCO stockholders. In the spin-off, NACCO stockholders, in addition to retaining their shares of NACCO common stock, received one share of Hamilton Beach Holding Class A common stock and one share of Hamilton Beach Holding Class B common stock for each share of NACCO Class A or Class B common stock. In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance, the Company accounted for the spin-off from NACCO based on the historical carrying value of assets and liabilities. As a result of the distribution of one share of Hamilton Beach Holding Class A common stock and one share of Hamilton Beach Holding Class B common stock for each share of NACCO Class A or NACCO Class B common stock, the earnings per share amounts for the Company for periods prior to the spin-off have been calculated based upon the number of shares distributed in the spin-off. NACCO did not receive any proceeds from the spin-off.

A. Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc.
General

In addition, HBB designs, markets and distributes commercial products for restaurants, bars and hotels. HBB generally markets its “better” and “best” products under the Hamilton Beach® brand and uses the Proctor Silex® brand for the “good” and opening price point products. HBB participates in the “only-the-best” market with the Hamilton Beach Professional brand, under a licensing agreement to sell a line of counter top appliances and kitchen tools under the Wolf Gourmet® brand, and with the new CHI®-branded, garment-care line under a multi-year licensing deal that began initial shipments in 2017.

Customers
Consumer sales in North America are generated predominantly by a network of inside sales employees to mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers, distributors and other retail outlets. Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 32% of HBB’s revenues in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. Amazon accounted for approximately 12%, 10%, and 8% of HBB's revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. HBB’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 55%, 54% and 52% of HBB’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of or significant reduction in sales to any key customer could result in significant decreases in HBB’s revenues and profitability and its ability to sustain or grow its business.
Backlog
Because of the seasonal nature of the markets for small electric household appliances, HBB’s management believes backlog is not a meaningful indicator of performance and is not a significant indicator of annual sales. Backlog represents customer orders, which may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment. Backlog for HBB was approximately $18.8 million and $14.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Product Warranties
HBB’s warranty program to the consumer consists generally of a limited warranty lasting for varying periods of up to ten years for electric appliances, with the majority of products having a warranty of one year. Under its warranty program, HBB may repair or replace, at its option, those products returned under warranty.
Working Capital
The market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. Revenues and operating profit for HBB are traditionally greater in the second half of the year as sales of small electric appliances to retailers and consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Because of the seasonality of purchases of its products, HBB generally uses a substantial amount of cash or short-term debt to finance inventories and accounts receivable in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
HBB holds patents and trademarks registered in the U.S. and foreign countries for various products. HBB believes its business is not dependent upon any individual patent, copyright or license, but that the Hamilton Beach®, Proctor Silex®, Hamilton Beach Commercial®, and Weston® trademarks are material to its business.
Product Design and Development
HBB spent $10.4 million, $9.7 million and $9.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on product design and development activities.
Key Suppliers and Raw Material
HBB’s products are supplied to its specifications by third-party suppliers located primarily in China. HBB does not maintain long-term purchase contracts with suppliers and operates mainly on a purchase order basis. HBB generally negotiates the purchases from its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars.
During 2017, HBB purchased 98% of its finished products from suppliers in China. HBB purchases its inventory from approximately 49 suppliers, two of which represented more than 10% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017. HBB believes the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet HBB’s production and quality requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect HBB’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
The principal raw materials used by HBB’s third-party suppliers to manufacture its products are plastic, glass, steel, copper, aluminum and packaging materials. HBB believes adequate quantities of raw materials are available from various suppliers.
Competition
The small electric household appliance industry does not have substantial entry barriers. As a result, HBB competes with many small manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. Based on publicly available information about the industry, HBB believes it is one of the largest full-line distributors and marketers of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances in North America based on key product categories.

HBB also competes to a lesser degree in Europe through its commercial product lines, and in South America and China. The competition in these geographic markets is more fragmented than in North America, and HBB is not yet a significant participant in these retail markets.
As brick and mortar retailers generally purchase a limited selection of branded, small electric appliances, HBB competes with other suppliers for retail shelf space. In the e-commerce channel, HBB must compete with a broad list of competitors. HBB conducts consumer advertising for the Hamilton Beach® brand and the Weston® brand. HBB believes the principal areas of competition with respect to its products are product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, supply chain excellence, merchandising, promotion and warranty.
Government Regulation
HBB is subject to numerous federal and state health, safety and environmental regulations. HBB’s management believes the impact of expenditures to comply with such laws will not have a material adverse effect on HBB.
As a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to seek to exclude products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous from the market. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of HBB’s products, or HBB may voluntarily do so.
Throughout the world, electrical appliances are subject to various mandatory and voluntary standards, including requirements in some jurisdictions that products be listed by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”) or other similar recognized laboratories. HBB also uses Intertek Testing Services for certification and testing of compliance with UL standards, as well as other nation and industry specific standards. HBB endeavors to have its products designed to meet the certification requirements of, and to be certified in, each of the jurisdictions in which they are sold.
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires public companies to disclose whether certain minerals, commonly known as "conflict minerals," are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by those companies and if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country. Our compliance with these disclosure requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components used in HBB's products. In addition, the supply-chain due diligence investigation required by the conflict minerals rules requires expenditures of resources and management attention, regardless of the results of the investigation.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, HBB’s work force consisted of approximately 650 employees, none of whom are represented by unions except for 16 hourly employees at HBB’s Picton, Ontario distribution facility. These employees are represented by an employee association which performs a consultative role on employment matters. None of HBB’s U.S. employees are unionized. HBB believes its current labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
B. Kitchen Collection
General
KC is a national specialty retailer of kitchenware in outlet and traditional malls throughout the United States.
Sales and Marketing
KC operated 210 retail stores as of December 31, 2017 in outlet and traditional malls throughout the United States. The stores sell kitchenware from a number of highly recognizable name-brands, including Hamilton Beach® and Proctor Silex®. KC sales accounted for 17.4%, 19.4% and 19.7% of the Hamilton Beach Holding’s annual revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Seasonality
Revenues and operating profit for KC are traditionally greater in the second half of the year as sales to consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Because of the seasonality of purchases of its products, KC incurs substantial short-term debt to finance inventories in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
KC holds a trademark registered in the U.S. for the KC store name and believes that the trademark is material to its business.

Product Design and Development
KC, a retailer, has limited expenditures for product design and development activities.
Product Sourcing and Distribution
KC purchases all inventory centrally, which allows it to take advantage of volume purchase discounts and monitor controls over inventory and product mix. KC purchases its inventory from approximately 199 suppliers, one of which represented approximately 21% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017. No other supplier represents more than 10% of purchases. KC believes that the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet KC’s requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect KC’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
KC currently maintains its inventory for distribution to its stores at a distribution center located near its corporate headquarters in Chillicothe, Ohio. 
Competition
KC competes against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, e-commerce competitors and catalog retailers. The retail environment continues to be extremely competitive. Widespread Chinese sourcing of products allows many retailers to offer value-priced kitchen products. While a number of very low-end and very high-end kitchenware retailers participate in the marketplace, KC believes there continues to be an opportunity for stores offering mid-priced, high-quality kitchenware.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, KC’s work force consisted of approximately 950 employees. None of KC’s employees are unionized. KC believes its current labor relations with employees are satisfactory.
