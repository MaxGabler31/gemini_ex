Sirius XM Radio Inc.
We transmit music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through our two proprietary satellite radio systems.  Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus certain other features such as SiriusXM On Demand, over our Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.

Programming
We offer a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, and news, including:

• | an extensive selection of music genres, ranging from rock, pop and hip-hop to country, dance, jazz, Latin and classical;


• | live play-by-play sports from major leagues and colleges;


• | a multitude of talk and entertainment channels for a variety of audiences;


• | a wide range of national, international and financial news; and


• | exclusive limited run channels.

Our diverse spectrum of programming, including our lineup of exclusive material, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers.  We make changes to our programming lineup from time to time as we strive to attract new subscribers and offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to our existing subscribers.  The channel lineups for our services are available at siriusxm.com.
Internet Radio Service
We stream select music and non-music channels over the Internet.  Our Internet radio service includes certain channels that are not available on our satellite radio service.  Access to our Internet radio service is offered to subscribers for a fee.  We also offer applications to allow consumers to access our Internet radio service on smartphones, tablets, computers, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.
SiriusXM Internet Radio offers listeners enhanced programming discovery and the ability to connect with content currently playing across our commercial-free music, sports, comedy, news, talk and entertainment channels or available through SiriusXM On Demand. SiriusXM On Demand offers our Internet radio subscribers the ability to choose their favorite episodes from a catalog of content whenever they want. 
We are developing significant enhancements to our Internet radio service. These enhancements will include a substantial redesign of our mobile app and are expected to be introduced in 2018. The redesign of our Internet radio service will include, among other things, additional functionality, video streaming, content discovery and other features designed to increase consumer engagement with our Internet radio product.
360L
In 2018, we are introducing a user interface, which we call “360L,” that combines our satellite and Internet services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience. 360L will allow us to take advantage of advanced in-dash infotainment systems.  360L is intended to leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage of our satellite infrastructure and low delivery costs with the two-way communication capability of a wireless Internet service to provide consumers seamless access to our content, including our live channels, on demand service and even more personalized music services.  The wireless Internet connection included in 360L will enable enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of our content in the vehicle easier than ever.  360L will also allow consumers to manage aspects of their subscriptions directly through their vehicles’ equipment and is expected to eventually provide us important data to better enable us to understand how our subscribers use our service and how we can more effectively market our service to consumers.

Distribution of Radios
Automakers
We distribute satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles.  We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles.  Satellite radios are available as a factory or dealer-installed option in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States.
Most automakers include a subscription to our radio service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles.  In certain cases, we receive subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of our service.  We share with certain automakers a portion of the revenues we derive from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive our service.  We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses.
Previously Owned Vehicles
We acquire subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios.  We have entered into agreements with many automakers to market subscriptions to purchasers and lessees of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs.  We also work directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified vehicles.
We have developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and have established marketing plans to promote our services to these potential subscribers.
Retail
We sell satellite radios directly to consumers through our website.  Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national, regional and internet retailers, such as amazon.com.
Our Satellite Radio Systems
Our satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas of the continental United States despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions.  We continually monitor our infrastructure and regularly evaluate improvements in technology.
Our satellite radio systems have three principal components:

• | satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities;


• | studios; and


• | radios.

Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities
Satellites.  We provide our service through a fleet of five orbiting geostationary satellites, two in the Sirius system, FM-5 and FM-6, and three in the XM system, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5.  Our XM-5 satellite serves as a spare for both the XM and Sirius systems.
We have entered into agreements for the design, construction and launch of two new satellites, SXM-7 and SXM-8, which we plan to launch into geostationary orbits in 2019 and 2020, respectively, as replacements for XM-3 and XM-4.
Satellite Insurance.  We have procured insurance for SXM-7 and SXM-8 to cover the risks associated with each satellite's launch and first year in orbit. We do not have insurance policies covering our in-orbit satellites, as we consider the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.
Terrestrial Repeaters.  In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from our satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected.  In other areas with a high density of next generation wireless systems our service may experience interference. In many of these areas, we have deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement and enhance our signal coverage and, in many other areas, we are planning to deploy additional repeaters to reduce interference.  We operate over 1,000 terrestrial repeaters across the United States as part of our systems.
4

Other Satellite Facilities.  We control and communicate with our satellites from facilities in North America. Our satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator.
Studios
Our programming originates from studios in New York City and Washington D.C. and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Los Angeles, Nashville and a variety of venues across the country.  Our corporate headquarters is based in New York City.  Both our New York City and Washington D.C. offices house facilities for programming origination, transmission and personnel.
Radios
We do not manufacture radios.  We have authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and have licensed our technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands.  We do manage various aspects of the production of satellite radios.  To facilitate the sale of radios, we may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers.
Connected Vehicle Services
We provide connected vehicle services. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.  We offer a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicles diagnostics, and stolen or parked vehicle locator services.  Our connected vehicle business provides services to several automakers and directly to consumers through aftermarket devices.
Subscribers to our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
Other Services
Commercial Accounts.  Our programming is available for commercial establishments.  Commercial subscription accounts are available through providers of in-store entertainment solutions and directly from us. Commercial subscribers are included in our subscriber count.
Satellite Television Service.  Certain of our music channels are offered as part of select programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service.  Subscribers to the DISH Network satellite television service are not included in our subscriber count.
Subscribers to the following services are not included in our subscriber count, unless the applicable service is purchased by the subscriber separately and not as part of a radio subscription to our services:
Travel Link.  We offer Travel Link, a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings.
Real-Time Traffic Services.  We offer services that provide graphic information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible in-vehicle navigation systems.
Real-Time Weather Services.  We offer several real-time weather services designed for improving situational awareness in vehicles, boats and planes.
About Sirius XM Canada
In 2017, Sirius XM completed a recapitalization of Sirius XM Canada (the “Sirius Canada Transaction”) which is now a privately held corporation. Sirius XM holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of the voting and equity interests held by two of Sirius XM Canada’s previous shareholders.
The total consideration from Sirius XM to Sirius XM Canada, excluding transaction costs, was $308.5 million, which included $129.7 million in cash and we issued 35 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $178.9
5

million to the holders of the shares of Sirius XM Canada acquired in the Sirius Canada Transaction. Sirius XM received common stock, non-voting common stock and preferred stock of Sirius XM Canada.
In connection with the Sirius Canada Transaction, Sirius XM also made a contribution in the form of a loan to Sirius XM Canada in the aggregate amount of $130.8 million. The loan is denominated in Canadian dollars, has a term of fifteen years, bears interest at a rate of 7.62% per annum and includes customary covenants and events of default, including an event of default relating to Sirius XM Canada’s failure to maintain specified leverage ratios. The terms of the loan require Sirius XM Canada to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan within sixty days of the end of each fiscal year in an amount equal to any cash on hand in excess of C$10,000 at the last day of the financial year if all target dividends have been paid in full.
In connection with the Sirius Canada Transaction, Sirius XM also entered into a Services Agreement and an Advisory Services Agreement with Sirius XM Canada. Each agreement has a thirty year term. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada will pay Sirius XM 25% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis through December 31, 2021 and 30% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis thereafter. Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada will pay Sirius XM 5% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis. These agreements superseded and replaced the former agreements between Sirius XM Canada and its predecessors and Sirius XM. 
As of December 31, 2017, Sirius XM Canada had approximately 2.8 million subscribers. Sirius XM Canada's subscribers are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics. 
About our Pandora Investment
Pursuant to an Investment Agreement with Pandora, in 2017, Sirius XM purchased 480,000 shares of Pandora’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $480 million. The Series A Preferred Stock, including accrued but unpaid dividends, represents a stake of approximately 19% of Pandora's currently outstanding common stock, and approximately a 16% interest on an as-converted basis. 
The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock of Pandora (“Pandora Common Stock”) at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share of Pandora Common Stock and an initial conversion rate of 95.2381 shares of Pandora Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 6.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, if and when declared. Any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock may be settled by Pandora, at its option, in shares of Pandora Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof. However, unless and until Pandora’s stockholders have approved the issuance of greater than 19.99% of the outstanding Pandora Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock may not be converted into more than 19.99% of Pandora’s outstanding Pandora Common Stock as of June 9, 2017.
The investment includes a mandatory redemption feature on any date from and after September 22, 2022 whereby Sirius XM, at its option, may require Pandora to purchase the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends for, at the election of Pandora, cash, shares of Pandora Common Stock or a combination thereof.
We have appointed James E. Meyer, our Chief Executive Officer, David J. Frear, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Gregory B. Maffei, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, to Pandora's Board of Directors pursuant to our designation rights under the Investment Agreement. Mr. Maffei also serves as the Chairman of Pandora's Board of Directors.
Our right to designate directors will fall away once we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 50% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement. Following the earlier to occur of (i) September 22, 2019 and (ii) the date on which we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock that were issued upon conversion thereof equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 75% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement, we have the right to designate only two directors. 
We are subject to certain standstill restrictions, including, among other things, that we are restricted from acquiring additional securities of Pandora until December 9, 2018. 
6

Except as to matters that may be voted upon separately by holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, we are entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of Pandora Common Stock on an as-converted basis (up to a maximum of 19.99% of the Pandora Common Stock outstanding on June 9, 2017, unless stockholder approval has been received). We are also entitled to a separate class vote with respect to certain amendments to Pandora’s organizational documents, issuances by Pandora of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock and the incurrence of certain indebtedness by Pandora. 
Upon certain change of control events involving Pandora, Pandora is required to repurchase all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the greater of (1) an amount in cash equal to 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends through June 9, 2022 (assuming such shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding through such date) and (2) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Pandora Common Stock immediately prior to the change of control event (disregarding the 19.99% cap). 
Beginning on September 22, 2020, if the volume weighted average price per share of Pandora Common Stock exceeds $18.375, as may be adjusted, for at least 20 trading days in any period of 30 consecutive trading days, Pandora may redeem all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends for, at the election of Pandora, cash, shares of Pandora Common Stock or a combination thereof, provided that, unless stockholder approval has been received, Pandora may not settle the redemption for shares of Pandora Common Stock to the extent the 19.99% cap would be exceeded.
 Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into with Pandora, we have certain customary registration rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof.
Competition
Satellite Radio
We face significant competition for both listeners and advertisers in our satellite radio business, including from providers of radio and other audio services.
Traditional AM/FM Radio.  Our services compete with traditional AM/FM radio.  Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees.  Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports.  The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio may reduce the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for our subscription services and, by offering free broadcasts, it may impose limits on what we can charge for our services. Several traditional radio companies own large numbers of radio stations or other media properties.
Internet-Based Competitors.  Internet radio services often have no geographic limitations and provide listeners with radio programming from across the country and around the world.  Major online providers make high fidelity digital streams available through the Internet for free or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription.  Certain of these services include advanced functionality, such as personalization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content.  For some consumers, these services may compete with our services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. 
Advanced In-Dash Infotainment Systems.  Nearly all automakers have deployed integrated multimedia systems in dashboards, including in many cases Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, Internet radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications.  Internet radio and other data are typically connected to the system through an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition.  These systems may enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in vehicles.
Direct Broadcast Satellite and Cable Audio.  A number of providers offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems.  These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home.  The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service.
Other Digital Media Services.  The audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with our services now or that could compete with those services in the future.
7

Traffic Services
A number of providers compete with our traffic services.  In-dash navigation is threatened by smartphones that provide data services through a direct vehicle interface.  Most of these smartphones offer GPS mapping with sophisticated data-based turn-by-turn navigation.
Connected Vehicle Services
Our connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers, including Verizon Telematics, as well as products being developed by automakers for their vehicles.  OnStar, a division of General Motors, also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles.  We also compete with wireless devices such as mobile phones.  We compete against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the basis of innovation, service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and systems customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.
Government Regulation
As operators of a privately-owned satellite system, we are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:

• | the licensing of our satellite systems;


• | preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and


• | compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services.

Any assignment or transfer of control of our FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC.  The FCC's order approving the merger of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, with and into XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 (the “Merger”) requires us to comply with certain voluntary commitments we made as part of the FCC Merger proceeding.  We believe we comply with those commitments.
In 1997, we were the winning bidders for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services.  Our FCC licenses for our Sirius satellites expire in 2022 and 2025.  Our FCC licenses for our XM satellites expire in 2018, 2021 and 2022.  We anticipate that, absent significant misconduct on our part, the FCC will renew our licenses to permit operation of our satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites.
In some areas, we have installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement our satellite signal coverage.  The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted us a license through 2027 to operate our repeater network.
In certain cases, we obtain FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators.  We believe our radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules.
We are required to obtain export licenses or other approvals from the United States government to export certain equipment, services and technical data related to our satellites and their operations.  The transfer of such equipment, services and technical data outside the United States or to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China).
Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting our services could adversely affect our ability to retain our FCC licenses or the manner in which we operate.
Copyrights to Programming
In connection with our satellite radio music programming, we must negotiate and enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders:  Holders of copyrights in musical works (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of copyrights in sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work).
Musical Works
Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast 
8

Music, Inc. (“BMI”) and SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”).  The market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”), have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders.  We have arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and GMR, and are in negotiations with BMI for a new agreement. If we are unable to reach an agreement with BMI, a court will determine the royalty we will be required to pay BMI.  The changing market for musical works may have an adverse effect on us, including increasing our costs or limiting the musical works available to us. To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, including to mobile devices, we also must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright owners of musical compositions and sound recordings.  We have arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and GMR to license the musical compositions we stream over the Internet and are in negotiations with BMI for a new agreement.
Sound Recordings
Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists.  Under the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, or if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the Copyright Royalty Board (the “CRB”) of the Library of Congress.
On December 14, 2017, the CRB issued its determination regarding the royalty rate payable by us under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over our satellite radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period starting January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2022. Under the terms of the CRB’s decision, we are required to pay a royalty of 15.5% of gross revenues, subject to exclusions and adjustments, for the five-year period. The rate for 2017 was 11.0%.
The rates and terms permit us to reduce the payment due each month by the percentage of our transmissions of recordings that are directly licensed from copyright owners and the percentage of transmissions that comprise recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which recordings are not subject to the Copyright Act. The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from our U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers, and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings. Exclusions from revenue subject to the statutory license fee include, among other things: 

• | monies or other consideration attributable to the sale and/or license of equipment and/or other technology, including but not limited to bandwidth, sales of devices that receive our satellite radio services and any shipping and handling fees therefor;


• | royalties paid to us for intellectual property rights;


• | sales and use taxes;


• | credit card, invoice, activation, swap and early termination fees charged to subscribers and reasonably related to the expenses to which they pertain;


• | bad debt expense; and


• | revenues attributable to our current and future data services offered for a separate charge (such as weather, traffic, destination information, messaging, sports scores, stock ticker information, extended program associated data, video and photographic images, and such other telematics and/or data services as may exist from time to time); channels, programming, products and/or other services offered for a separate charge where such channels use only incidental performances of sound recordings; channels, programming, products and/or other services provided outside of the United States; and channels, programming, products and/or other services for which the performance of the recordings is exempt from any license requirement or is separately licensed, including by a statutory license.

Once the CRB has considered any rehearing motions and responses to such motions, and provided the Register of Copyrights with sixty days to review the determination for any legal error, the Librarian of Congress will publish the final determination in the Federal Register. The parties will have thirty days from that publication to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
9

The licensing of certain sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 for use on the Internet is also subject to the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 on terms established by the CRB.  In 2017, we paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings on the Internet of $0.0022.  In accordance with the CRB’s 2016 decision, this royalty rate increased in 2018 to $0.0023 per subscription performance and may increase further through 2020 based on changes in the consumer price index.
Our rights to perform certain copyrighted sound recordings that were fixed after February 15, 1972 are governed by United States federal law, the Copyright Act.  In contrast, our rights to perform certain sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 are governed by state law. During 2015 and 2016, we settled suits with copyright owners for almost all of the pre-1972 sound recordings we use.
Trademarks
We have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” and “SXM” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services we offer. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use the “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” or “SXM” trademarks in the United States.  We also have registered, and intend to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of our channels.  We have also registered the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM” and “SiriusXM” in Canada. We have granted a license to use certain of our trademarks in Canada to Sirius XM Canada.
Personnel
As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,575 full-time employees.  In addition, we rely upon a number of part-time employees, consultants, other advisors and outsourced relationships. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
