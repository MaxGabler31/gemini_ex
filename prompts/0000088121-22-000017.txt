General Development of Business
Seaboard Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Seaboard”) together comprise a diverse group of integrated companies with a broad global presence. Seaboard is primarily engaged in hog production and pork processing in the United States (“U.S.”); commodity trading and grain processing in Africa and South America; cargo shipping services in the U.S., Caribbean and Central and South America; sugar and alcohol production in Argentina; and electric power generation in the Dominican Republic. Seaboard also has an equity method investment in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”), a producer and processor of turkey products. 

Approximately 77% of the outstanding common stock of Seaboard is collectively owned by Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC. Ellen Bresky, the Chairwoman of the Board of Directors, and other members of the Bresky family, including trusts created for their benefit, own the equity interests of Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC, which are Delaware limited liability companies. 

Seaboard continues to encounter challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related variants, mostly with labor shortages at certain of its locations. There still remains uncertainty about the expected duration and severity of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants, will have on Seaboard’s operations and the global economy. 
Description of Business
Principal Products and Services and Any Dependency
Pork Segment - Seaboard, through its subsidiary Seaboard Foods LLC, is a vertically integrated pork producer that primarily produces and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, distributors and grocery stores. This segment sells to U.S. customers and exports to Japan, Mexico, China and numerous other foreign markets. During 2021, Seaboard raised approximately 88% of the hogs processed at its processing plant in Oklahoma, with the remaining hog requirements purchased primarily under contracts from independent producers. Seaboard’s hog production facilities consist of genetic and commercial breeding, farrowing, nursery and finishing buildings. 

Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Seaboard Triumph Foods, LLC (“STF”), which operates a pork processing plant located in Iowa, with a capacity to process approximately six million market hogs annually. Seaboard has agreements with STF and Triumph Foods, LLC (“Triumph”), an independent pork processor, to market substantially all pork products produced at STF’s and Triumph’s pork processing plants. Seaboard and Triumph supply a portion of the hogs processed at the STF plant. Seaboard’s revenues for its pork products are primarily based on a margin sharing arrangement that considers the average sales price, standard costs and the mix of products sold from the Seaboard, Triumph and STF pork processing plants. The Pork segment also has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily’s Premium Meats, LLC, which produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon using pork bellies sourced from Seaboard, Triumph and STF, at its locations in Utah, Montana and Missouri. In early 2022, Seaboard’s Pork segment sold to Triumph a 50% interest in Seaboard de Mexico USA LLC, its ham-boning and processing plant in Mexico, that has the current capacity to process 96 million pounds of ham annually.
The Pork segment produces biodiesel at facilities in Oklahoma and Missouri and is expected to begin producing renewable diesel at a new facility in Kansas in 2022. These products are produced from pork fat supplied by the Oklahoma pork processing plant and other animal fats and vegetable oils purchased from third parties and sold to fuel blenders for distribution. 

CT&M Segment - Seaboard’s CT&M segment, which is managed under the name of Seaboard Overseas and Trading Group, is an integrated agricultural commodity trading, processing and logistics company. Seaboard’s CT&M segment has ownership interests in several non-consolidated affiliates to further its business strategies and partner with others that have expertise. Overall, the CT&M segment, including its affiliates, has facilities in 29 countries, primarily in Africa and South America. This segment sources, transports and markets approximately 14 million metric tons per year of wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and other commodities. Also, Seaboard and its affiliates produce approximately six million metric tons of wheat flour, maize meal, manufactured feed and oilseed crush commodities per year in addition to other related grain-based products. This segment owns three vessels, but the majority of the trading business is transacted with chartered ships. 
Marine Segment - Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Seaboard Marine Ltd., and various foreign affiliated companies and third-party agents, provides cargo shipping services in the U.S. and 26 countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. The Marine segment’s primary operations are in Miami, Florida, and include a marine terminal and an off-port warehouse for cargo consolidation and temporary storage. Seaboard also makes scheduled vessel calls in

​



Brooklyn, New York; Houston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Savannah, Georgia and various foreign ports in the Caribbean and Central and South America. The Marine segment uses a network of offices and agents to sell freight services. Seaboard’s Marine segment capabilities allow transport by truck or rail of import and export cargo to and from various U.S. and foreign ports. This segment’s fleet consists of 20 chartered and four owned vessels as of December 31, 2021, as well as dry, refrigerated, and specialized containers. 
Sugar and Alcohol Segment - Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Seaboard Energías Renovables y Alimentos S.R.L., operates a vertically integrated sugar and alcohol production facility in Argentina. Seaboard supplies most of the raw material processed in this facility with sugarcane grown on land that it owns. The sugar is primarily marketed locally, with some exports to other countries. The alcohol is marketed to industrial users and sold as dehydrated alcohol to certain oil companies under the Argentine governmental bioethanol program, which requires alcohol to be blended with gasoline. The Sugar and Alcohol segment had two bioethanol customers that collectively represented 35%-48% of its total sales in each of the last three years. This segment also owns a 51-megawatt cogeneration power plant, which is fueled by the burning of sugarcane by-products, natural gas and other biomass, like woodchips.

Power Segment - Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Transcontinental Capital Corp. (Bermuda) Ltd., is an independent power producer generating electricity for the Dominican Republic power grid. It is not directly involved in the transmission or distribution of electricity and is exempt from regulations under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1938, as amended. Seaboard’s Power segment owns two power barges, one of which is still under construction. The barge that began operations in 2012, commonly referred to as Estrella Del Mar II (“EDM II”), is capable of using natural gas or heavy fuel oil to produce up to 108 megawatts of electricity. The barge expected to be completed in 2022, commonly referred to as Estrella Del Mar III (“EDM III”), will have capacity to generate approximately 146 megawatts of electricity using gaseous fuels, including natural gas. Commercial operations of the new barge are expected to begin in 2022. Seaboard continues to explore strategic alternatives for the other barge, including a sale or relocation. 
Turkey Segment - Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”), a vertically integrated producer and processor of conventional, antibiotic-free and organic turkey products. Butterball is a national supplier to retail stores, foodservice outlets and industrial entities, and to a lesser extent, exports products to Mexico and other foreign markets. The Turkey segment had two retail customers that collectively represented approximately 28% of its sales in each of the last three years. 
Other Businesses - Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Mount Dora Farms Inc., processes jalapeño peppers at its plant in Honduras, which are primarily shipped to and sold in the U.S. 
See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for total revenue contributed by any class of similar products or services. 





Competitive Conditions
Competition in Seaboard’s Pork segment comes from a variety of regional, national and international producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. According to the trade publications Successful Farming and Informa Economics, Seaboard was ranked number three in hog production (based on sows in production) and number four in pork processing in the U.S. in 2021 (based on daily processing capacity, including Triumph’s and STF’s capacity).
Seaboard’s CT&M segment faces competition from numerous traders around the world and imported grain-processed products or other local producers in the same industries.
Seaboard’s Marine segment faces competition based on price, reliable sailing frequencies and customer service. 

Seaboard’s Sugar and Alcohol segment owns one of the largest sugar mills in Argentina and faces significant competition for sugar and alcohol sales in the local Argentine market. Sugar and alcohol prices in Argentina can fluctuate compared to world markets due to Argentine government price controls and protection policies. 
Seaboard’s Power segment primarily sells the power it generates to Dominican government-owned distribution companies at spot market rates. The Dominican government sets a cap on the electricity spot market prices and establishes the dispatch order of who sells into the power grid based on a merit list. To sell to the power grid, Seaboard competes with producers utilizing various types of fuel and generation technologies, including hydro, solar, wind, natural gas, heavy fuel oil or coal. Renewable energy producers and producers who have lower variable costs to operate may receive dispatch preference from the Dominican government. EDM III is expected to be more efficient than Seaboard’s existing dual-fueled barge, EDM II, due to the latest technologies and use of gas turbines instead of engines.

Competition for the Turkey segment comes from a variety of regional and national producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. 
Resources Material to Business
The Power segment and Turkey segment utilize material amounts of raw materials that are dependent on purchases from one supplier or a small group of dominant suppliers. The Power segment has entered into a long-term fuel supply agreement to ensure natural gas is available for expected operations. The Turkey segment purchases a significant portion of its feed and grain used in the manufacturing of feed for its turkeys in North Carolina from Seaboard’s 50% partner in Butterball.
Also, Seaboard believes there is significant recognition of the trademarks identified below in the various industries Seaboard serves and by many of its customers. The Pork segment uses registered trademarks including, but not limited to, Seaboard Foods®, Seaboard Farms®, Seaboard EnergyTM, Prairie Fresh®, Prairie Fresh USA Prime®, Our Farms, Our Commitment®, St. Joe Pork®, and Cook-in Bag®. The CT&M segment uses registered trademarks including, but not limited to, Mothers Pride® and Zambia’s Pride® in Zambia, Thunderbolt Flour® and Maid Marian® in Guyana, GMA® and Top Pain® in Ivory Coast, GMD® and Jarga® in Senegal, and Wayne® in Ecuador. The Marine segment uses the registered trademarks of Seaboard Marine® and Seaboard Solutions®. The Sugar and Alcohol segment markets sugar under the Chango® brand. The Turkey segment uses registered trademarks including, but not limited to, Butterball®, Carolina Turkey® and Farm to Family Butterball®. While Seaboard considers all of its intellectual and proprietary rights important, Seaboard believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license or other intellectual property right.
Seasonal Business
The Turkey business is seasonal for whole birds and related products, with the holiday season driving the majority of those sales. Seaboard’s other segments are not seasonally dependent to any material extent.

Governmental Regulations
Environmental Matters
Seaboard’s Pork segment and Turkey segment are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, such as treatment of wastewater and air emissions, that require the expenditure of funds in the ordinary course of business. Seaboard’s Pork and Turkey segments do not anticipate making expenditures for these purposes that, in the aggregate, would have a material effect on Seaboard’s financial condition or results of operations. Seaboard’s Marine and CT&M segments’ vessels are subject to environment regulations related to global sulfur emissions requirements that require either low-sulfur fuel or equipment on vessels to reduce emissions. These recent requirements have increased fuel costs and charter-hire rates but have not had a significant impact on financial results. Seaboard’s Power segment must receive permits from local authorities to operate, including environmental licenses among others, and these permits may be canceled or not renewed. The environmental license for EDM II currently runs through September 2023 and the environmental license for EDM III is still pending, but generally environmental licenses are for 2-5 years.
Other Regulations
As a company with global operations, Seaboard is subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations and anti-bribery and corruption laws. Seaboard has policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, Seaboard’s compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material effect on Seaboard’s financial condition or results of operations. Governmental regulations are subject to change, and accordingly, Seaboard is unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether compliance with such regulations will materially impact Seaboard’s business in the future.
Human Capital Resources
Generally, each of Seaboard’s segments operate autonomously to implement the human capital strategies that best meet the diverse needs of the segment’s workforce, industry, competitive environment and the legal requirements of the countries it operates in. This may include developing location-specific employee benefits and human capital policies and practices. Although individual programs and benefits may vary from segment to segment or location to location, all segments align with Seaboard’s core principles which emphasize physical wellness and safety, financial wellness, learning and development and global diversity and acceptance. 
As of December 31, 2021, Seaboard had approximately 13,200 total employees, of whom approximately 6,700 were in the U.S. The Pork segment, which operates primarily in the U.S., employs approximately 6,000 employees. Substantially all of the Pork segment’s processing plant’s hourly employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in 2026. The CT&M segment employs approximately 3,000 employees, primarily in Africa and South America.

​



In the Marine segment, approximately 38% out of its approximately 2,400 employees are located in the U.S., primarily in Florida and Texas. The Sugar and Alcohol segment employs approximately 1,200 employees in Argentina and substantially all of its hourly mill employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that renews in April of each year. The Power segment has approximately 230 employees in the Dominican Republic. Seaboard believes its relationships with its employees and their representative labor organizations are good. 
In all operations, employees are critical to the success of Seaboard. Recruitment and retention continue to be a challenge for some of Seaboard’s locations, including in the Pork segment. Currently 24% of the Pork segment’s workforce is dependent upon employment visas in different production areas. In the CT&M segment, which has operations in developing countries, challenges associated with safety and political stability may exist from time to time, presenting challenges to identifying and retaining qualified expatriate personnel. 
Physical wellness and safety of Seaboard’s workforce at all locations is a top priority. Seaboard’s decentralized management approach provides flexibility to adapt to the needs of the workforce at each location, including providing specialized protective gear or tools, worker safety trainings, education on healthy habits, exercise facilities on site, discounted gym memberships and offering health insurance and preventive care. 
Flexible compensation and benefit strategies are developed by Seaboard’s segments to attract and retain employees and reduce turnover and associated costs. Seaboard provides competitive pay, paid time off, holidays and other benefits depending upon location. In the Power segment, the company provides support for an employee co-op that offers savings accounts and loans to employees. The Pork and Power segments provide employee discounts on products produced such as meat and sugar.
Seaboard’s companies also provide on-the-job training and various professional development opportunities. For example, employees in the Pork segment are eligible for tuition reimbursement and the segment has developed a comprehensive training program to promote internal employees to management positions.
Because Seaboard operates around the world, global diversity and acceptance at all of Seaboard companies is critical for continued success, including at the highest levels, where two of Seaboard’s board of directors are female, including the chairperson.
