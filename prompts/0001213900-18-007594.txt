ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
The Company, a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1987. The Company designs, assembles, tests and sells our proprietary and patented axial flux induction machine known as the AuraGen® for industrial and commercial applications and the VIPER for military applications (collectively referred to as the “AuraGen”). The Company also designs, tests and sells our proprietary linear-force electromagnetic actuators.
 
Our patented AuraGen® system –– when applied as a generator –– uses the existing engine of a vehicle (or any other prime mover) to create mechanical energy which is then converted into electric power by our system. Our patented control system is used to deliver such power to the user. When used as an electric motor, our system delivers mechanical power to drive mechanical devices. During the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company significantly reduced operations due to lack of financial resources. During the second half of fiscal 2016, the Company’s operations were completely disrupted when the Company was forced to move from its facilities in Redondo Beach, California to a smaller facility in Stanton, California. During fiscal 2017, the Company suspended its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations. During fiscal 2018, the Company successfully restructured in excess of $30 million of debt and held its first stockholder meeting since 2011. Subsequent to year end, we have begun once again shipping units.
 
Traditional induction machines represent a radial flux design and are the workhorse of industry due to their robustness, attractive cost, and easy control. However, radial flux machines are also relatively heavy and bulky. Axial flux induction machines (such as the AuraGen®), on the other hand, have all of the advantages of radial flux machines, but with the advantage of higher energy density. This results in axial flux machines being smaller and lighter yet with equivalent performance. Unlike permanent magnet (“PM”) machines, induction machines do not use any permanent magnets and therefore the controller can change the magnetic (B) fields since generally the magnetic (B) field is proportionate to the voltage divided by the frequency (V/f). It is generally accepted that for PM machines, as machine size grows, the magnetic losses increase proportionately, and partial load efficiency drops. On the other hand, with induction machines, as the machine size grows, magnetic losses do not necessarily grow. Induction drives could offer an advantage when high-performance is desired. The peak efficiency of an induction drive will be somewhat lower than with PM machines, but average efficiency may actually increase.
 
The history of electric motors reveals that the earliest machines were in fact axial flux machines. However, after the first radial flux machines were demonstrated in the early 1900’s, such machines were accepted as mainstream configuration. The reason for shelving the axial flux machines were multifold and can be summarized as follows: (i) strong axial magnetic attraction force between the stator and the rotor, (ii) fabrication difficulties such as cutting the slots in laminated cores, (iii) high cost involved in manufacturing the laminated stator core, (iv) difficulties in assembling the machine and maintaining a uniform air gap and (v) providing a laminated rotor that can stand the large centrifugal forces. Technological developments by Aura show that all of the historical objections for axial flux machines can be addressed with recent developments in the design of such machines, as well as, the design of the proper manufacturing processes and tooling.
 
The issue of the strong axial magnetic attraction force between the stator and the rotor was addressed by Aura’s patented approach of using a topology of two stators and a rotor sandwiched between them. This has been disclosed in Aura’s U.S. Patent 5,734,217 (March 1998), which expired in March 2018, and U.S. Patent 6,157,175 (Dec. 2000). In addition to other benefits, the topology is such that the axial forces on the bearings are very small and negligible.
 
The Company has also developed a cast rotor for the axial flux machine as described in U.S. Patents 5,734,217 and 6,157,175. This rotor does not require any laminates and provides the structural integrity to withstand very large centrifugal forces, while at the same time provides the proper electric and magnetic properties.
 
Aura’s US Patent 8,955,624 (February 2015) teaches a method for retrofitting a vehicle to transfer mechanical power out of the engine compartment. This is essential for vehicles that don’t have sufficient space in the engine compartment for Aura’s axial flux induction generator.

The issues of fabrication difficulties and the high cost involved in manufacturing of the laminated stator cores were resolved years ago by the Company using a technique involving punching the slots while rolling the steel. This approach creates a continuous punched steel ribbon at a cost that is lower than the traditional punched laminates because less material is wasted. The equipment required uses a closed loop control system that controls a precision step-motor and a punching press. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered thousands of units of our induction axial flux machines in the 5-16kW range and have not encountered technical issues that would appear to affect the use of the same techniques in any other size induction axial flux machines. Many manufacturers of PM axial flux machines, including Aura, have resolved the issues regarding difficulties in assembling the machine and maintaining a uniform air gap. Therefore, this is no longer an issue.
 
As described above, the Company developed the technology and manufacturing processes to overcome the traditional objections to axial flux machines. Once we resolved the historical issues relating to the axial flux approach as described above, the next step was to develop a smart control system that provided for a total variable speed solution. A complete power generation system based on Aura’s axial flux generator and Aura’s unique smart controller is disclosed in Aura’s U.S. Patent 6,700,214 (March 2, 2004). Finally, Aura’s U.S. Patent 6,700,802 (March 2, 2004) disclosed a method where power from multi sources can be added to handle sudden power spikes such those that occur when a compressor, motor, or pump is turned on. In addition, patent 6,700,802 provides a very unique method (bi-directional power supply) for uninterrupted seamless transition from generator power to battery pack power and back to generator power.
 
The AuraGen® system is composed of three primary subsystems (i) the patented axial flux alternator, (ii) the electronic control unit (“ECU”) and (iii) mounting kit that is a mechanical interface between the alternator and the prime mover. The architecture of our patented ECU is designed to separate the power generation from the power user, thus creating a flexible system that can support multi voltages simultaneously. The system architecture is based on having a direct current (“DC”) power bus that is used to excite the alternator and also to collect energy from the alternator. The user loads are supported from the power bus and not directly from the alternator. This immediately leads to a load following design where the demand on the alternator at any moment in time is equal to the demanded user load (up to the maximum alternator power capabilities). In addition, the output power is constructed from the power bus with either a PWM based inverter for alternating current (“AC”) output, and/or, a unique patented bi direction power supply (“BDPS”) that acts as a DC to DC converter to provide different DC voltages as an output. The BDPS provides the capability of adding power to the bus from a DC source such as batteries whenever sudden spikes or demands occur. The BDPS also provides the seamless transition to maintain the power bus when the prime mover is turned off (batteries are used to support the power bus).
 
After a lengthy development period, the Company began commercializing the AuraGen® in late 1999 and early 2000. Our first commercial product was a 5,000-watt 120/240V AC machine, in 2001; we subsequently added an 8,000-watt configuration and also introduced the BDPS that allowed us to provide simultaneously an AC/DC solution. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced a system that generates up to 16,000-watts of continuous power by combining two 8,000 watts’ systems (dual system) and in fiscal 2010 introduced the TanGen system that combines two 8,000 watts systems on a single output shaft (two rotors on a single shaft). In May 2018, the Company demonstrated a new system that generates up to 15,000-watts of continuous power via a single system (as opposed to requiring a duel system) with the same small physical footprint as the 8,000 watts solution.
 
As described above, the focus on mobile power applications requires an interface kit to the prime mover. Many of our applications are such that the AuraGen/VIPER is driven directly from a truck or SUV engine. The Company now has configurations available for more than 90 different engine types, including a majority of models of General Motors and Ford, some Chrysler models and numerous other engine models made by International, Isuzu, Nissan, Hino (Toyota), Mitsubishi, Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, Cummins, and Freightliner. In addition, the Company has interface kits for numerous model of military HMMWV, as well as other military vehicles. Also, starting in fiscal 2008, the AuraGen/VIPER was installed on a number of U.S. Navy boats and on a number of the U.S. Coast Guard 44 ft. patrol boats. In addition to the usage of the vehicle engine as the prime mover, the Company has also developed numerous Power-Take-Off (“PTO”) interface kits for many different vehicle platforms.
 
Starting in early 2017, the Company began reexamining its strategic approach to the market and has identified key areas upon which to initially focus as the Company restarts operations. The markets available for AuraGen® products are both vertical and horizontal in nature and cover numerous industries and applications worldwide. As such, the Company has developed a strategy focused on the formation of international joint ventures and other strategic partnerships to address local markets and needs. The first such joint venture, Jiangsu Shengfeng Mobile Power Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu Shengfeng”), was entered into during 2017 to address the Chinese market. Under the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture agreement, Aura owns 49% of the venture and our Chinese partner owns 51%. The Chinese partner contributed approximately $9.25 million to the venture –– principally in the form of facilities and equipment as wells as approximately $500,000 in cash. The Company contributed $250,000 in cash as well as a limited license to the joint venture to manufacture, sell and service the AuraGen® products within China. The limited license sold to the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture, however, does not permit Jiangsu Shengfeng to manufacture the AuraGen® rotor; rather, the joint venture is required to purchase all rotor subassemblies as well as certain software elements directly from the Company. Jiangsu Shengfeng’s board of directors consists of three members appointed by the Company and three appointed by our Chinese partner; Jiangsu Shengfeng’s CEO is appointed by our Chinese partner while its CFO and director for quality assurance and control are appointed by Aura.

Business Arrangements
 
During the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company significantly reduced operations due to lack of financial resources. During the second half of fiscal 2016, the Company’s operations were disrupted when the Company was forced to move from its facilities in Redondo Beach, California to a smaller facility in Stanton, California. Operations during the second half of fiscal 2016 were sporadic. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, the Company suspended its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations. During this time, the Company’s agreements with numerous customers, third party vendors, and organizations and entities material to the operation of the Company business were canceled, delayed or terminated. During fiscal 2018, the Company successfully restructured in excess of $30 million of debt and, subsequent to year end, we have once again begun fulfilling orders.
 
In March 2017, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with a Chinese company to build, service and distribute AuraGen® products in China. The Chinese partner owns 51% of the joint venture and the Company owns 49%. The Chinese partner contributed approximately $9.75 million to the venture principally in the form of facilities, equipment, and approximately $500,000 of working capital while the Company contributed $250,000 in cash as well as a limited license. The limited license sold to the joint venture, however, does not permit the venture to manufacture the AuraGen® rotor; rather, the joint venture is required to purchase all rotor subassemblies as well as certain software elements directly from the Company.
 
The AuraGen®/VIPER
 
The AuraGen® is composed of three basic subsystems. The first subsystem is the axial flux induction generator that is bolted to, and driven by, the vehicle's engine, PTO, or any other prime mover. The second subsystem is the ECU, which filters and conditions the electricity to provide clean, steady voltages for both AC and DC power, and provides for variable speed applications as well as load following for increased efficiency. The third subsystem consists of mounting brackets and supporting components for installation and integration of the generator with the vehicle engine, PTO, or the prime mover.
 
Currently, the Company has power solutions for four continuous power levels: (a) 5,000 watts; (b) 8,000 watts; (c) 16,000 watts via a duel TanGen system and; (d) 15,000 watts via a single system. All the AC power is pure sine wave with total harmonic distortion of less than 2.1% and is available in 120 VAC and/or 230/240 VAC as well as 50/60 Hz and either single or three phases. In addition, the power generated on all models can be partitioned to provide simultaneous AC and 14 or 28 VDC. The AuraGen® power levels can be generated as the prime mover speed varies from idle to maximum rated speed. The VIPER (the military version of the AuraGen® system) includes as an option a complete power management system which (i) monitors in real time the batteries’ voltage and temperature, (ii) provides a partition of the power between AC and DC simultaneously with the ability to be programmed from all AC to all DC, (iii) monitors the RPM of the generator, (iv) monitors the temperatures of the generator and the ECU, (v) monitors the raw power generated, (vi) monitors both the AC and DC loads as to voltage and current, (vii) provides programming of load prioritization and load shedding, and (viii) monitors the voltage of the internal 400-800 VDC bus.
 
Mobile and Remote (not power grid connected) Power Industry
 
The mobile and remote power generation market is large and growing. There are four basic market segments (i) military, (ii) stationary but remote commercial/industrial, (iii) mobile commercial/industrial, and (iv) hybrid, electric and autonomous vehicles. The military market place is also divided between mobile and stationary applications.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2007 the U.S. motor and generator industry, for larger than one horsepower applications, recorded more than $9.5 billion in sales (U.S Census Bureau Industry Statistical Sampler).

 
We believe that one of the fastest growing segments in the military market place is On-Board-Exportable-Power (OBEP), which is electric power on vehicles that can be used to support other than vehicle functions. The driver for the increased demand for on board power are numerous advance weapon systems as well as increase in C4I functions (command, control, communication, computers and information). Currently, most on board power is provided by APUs that are (i) large fuel users, (ii) bulky, (iii) heavy and (iv) require constant maintenance. Militaries all over the world are seeking more efficient integrated power solutions for their vehicles.
 
Similar to the military demands, the commercial and industrial markets also require on board power to support modern computers, digital sensors and instruments as well as electrical driven tools. Current automotive alternators cannot supply the existing demanded power and thus the common solution is the use of APUs. These APUs are environmentally unfriendly, substantial users of fuel, heavy, bulky and require constant maintenance and scheduled service. Vehicles used in the telecommunications, utilities, public works, construction, catering, oil and gas industries, emergency/rescue, and recreational vehicles rely heavily on mobile power for their daily work. Hybrid and electric vehicles by their nature require significant amounts of on board power to charge batteries as well as to operate electric motors.
 
The traditional available solutions for mobile and remote power users are:
 

● | Gensets (AKA APUs), Gensets are standalone power generation units that are not incorporated into a vehicle and require external fuel, either gasoline or diesel, in order to generate electricity. Gensets (i) are generally noisy and cumbersome to transport because of their weight and size, (ii) typically run at constant speed to generate 50 or 60 Hz of AC power, (iii) must be operated at a significant part of the rated power to avoid wet staking, (iv) are significantly derated in the presence of harmonics in the loads and (v) require significant scheduled maintenance and service. Genset technology has been utilized since the 1950s.

● | High-Output Alternators, High-output alternators are traditionally found in trucks and commercial vehicles and the vehicle’s engine is used as the prime mover. All high-output alternators provide their rated power at very high RPM and significantly less power at lower RPM. In addition, high-output alternators are generally only 30% efficient at the low RPM range and increase to 50% efficiency at the high end of the RPM range. The power generated by high-output alternators is 12 or 24 Volt DC and an inverter is required if AC power is needed. In addition, due to the low power output at low RPMs, in order to get significant power, a throttle controller is used to speed-up the engine. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inverters, Inverters are devices that invert DC to AC. Inverters as mobile power generators are traditionally used in low power requirements, typically less than 2,500 watts, and do not have the ability to recharge the batteries that are traditionally used as the source of power. Thus, typical inverter users require other means to recharge the used batteries such as “shore-power” or gensets. More recently dynamic inverters became available. Dynamic inverters use power from the alternator to augment power from the batteries and are able to achieve power levels in excess of 6,000 watts. Dynamic inverters introduce significant stresses on both the batteries and alternators, which causes significant life shortening for both. When the inverter is turned on, the alternator is switched off from the vehicle battery and tied into a transformer that uses electronic controls to change the DC alternator inputs to AC inverter output. A separate transformer winding provides battery charging so that fully regulated 120 Volt AC and 12 Volt DC power is available as long as the engine is running at high enough RPM to provide power for the load and the battery charging. All dynamic inverters require a high-output alternator to be able to output significant AC power. As is often the case, the limiting factor is the high-output alternator. In order to get stable output, a very accurate throttle controller is also needed to maintain steady speed on the engine.

● | Permanent-Magnet Alternators. Recently, a number of companies have introduced alternators using exotic permanent magnets. These alternators tend to have higher power generation capabilities than regular alternators at lower engine RPM. In order to be practical in an under-the–hood environment (200oF) active cooling must be added, since the magnets are demagnetized at approximately 176oF. There are other issues that require an active control system that will add and subtract magnetic field strength as the engine RPM increases. Over 95% of the magnets used for electric machines comes from China and, beginning in 2011, the price of these magnets has sky-rocketed. In addition, China started limiting export of the magnets in order to have sufficient supplies for local consumption.

● | Fuel Cells. Fuel cells are solid-state devices that produce electricity by combining a fuel containing hydrogen with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications and can be used in place of the internal combustion engine and traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. The most widely deployed fuel cells cost about $2,000 per kilowatt.

Competition
 
The Company is involved in the application of its AuraGen® technology to mobile power and, as such, faces substantial competition from companies offering different technologies.
 
Gensets AKA APU- Portable generators meet the large market need for auxiliary power. Millions of units per year are sold in North America alone, and millions more across the world to meet market demands for 1 to 20 Kilowatts of portable power. The market for these power levels addresses the commercial, leisure and residential markets, and divides essentially into: (a) higher power, higher quality and higher price commercial level units; and (b) lower power, lower quality and lower price level units. Gensets provide the strongest competition across the widest marketplace for auxiliary power. Onan, Honda and Kohler, among others, are well established and respected brand names in the genset market for higher reliability auxiliary power generation. There are 44 registered genset-manufacturing companies in the United States.
 
High Output Alternators- There are many High Output Alternator manufacturers. Some of the better known are: Delco-Remy, Bosh, Nippon Densu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Prestolite. All alternators provide their rated power at very high RPM and significantly less power at lower RPM. In addition, alternators are generally only 30% efficient at the low RPM range and increase to 50% efficiency at the high RPM range. The AuraGen® end to end system (including mechanical linkages, belt and electronics) is over 85%5 efficient at low and moderate RPM ranges and is approximately 80%80 efficient at the very high RPM range (at very high RPM windage is the major lose).
 
Inverters-There are many inverter manufacturers; across the globe the best known one is Xentrex. The pricing of industrial grade sine wave inverters is approximately $700-850 per kilowatt plus the cost of a high output alternator ($1,000) and a good throttle controller ($250-500).
 
Permanent-Magnet (“PM”) alternators. -A number of companies have introduced alternators using exotic NdFeB magnets (UQM technologies is one of the better known). These alternators tend to have higher power generation capabilities than regular alternators at lower RPM. Unfortunately, PM machines with NdFeB magnets are very sensitive to temperature and, unlike the AuraGen, cannot survive the typical under-the-hood environment (200oF+). In order to apply such devices for automotive applications one must add expensive and cumbersome active cooling since the magnets are demagnetized at approximately (176oF). To date, such machines have been used mostly in wind-power generation applications.
 
In addition to the temperature challenges of such machines, there are other issues involving active control of the magnetic field. The main disadvantage of PM generators is the difficulty of output voltage regulation to compensate for speed and load variation due to the lack of a simple means of field control. 
 
Finally, PM machines are significantly more expensive than induction machines. Most of the material coming from China. In addition to the recent price increase, the Chinese government has historically used Nd as a political weapon, thus causing the US government and others to look for alternative solutions that do not use Nd magnets. Clearly the Aura solution is a great alternative to any PM solution.
 
Fuel Cells-Fuel cells are solid-state, devices that produce electricity by combining a fuel containing hydrogen with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications and can be used in place of the internal combustion engine and traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. These systems are, however, generally prohibitively expensive, and the most widely deployed fuel cells cost about $1,500 per kilowatt.
 
Others- Symetron Technology by Raser Inc. is sometimes mistaken for a new form of motor or generator. The Symetron technology is a variable frequency motor/generator controller that uses numerous control schemes to optimize performance. The Symetron technology involves adaptive tuning to continuously optimize motor and system efficiency for the speed and torque operating point. When the system was tested in November 2006 the adaptive algorithm or table calculations were performed offline and then input to the controller.

The Symetron controller is a potential competitor to variable speed motor controllers provided by such companies as of ABB, or Baldor-Electric Co. The Symetron technology is not a new form of motor/generator.
 

There are a number of companies that advertise a “secret” approach for higher performance of inductive machines. Typically, these claims are not proven and are based on changing the winding connections from Y to D or D to Y.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Axco in Finland briefly introduced axial flux machines similar to Aura’s. However, Axco stopped its pursuit of patent protection in the U.S. when they discovered Aura’s patents. Furthermore, one of Axco scientist cites Aura’s approach in his PhD dissertation. Axco business is currently focused on large permanent magnets applications mostly related to large windmills.
 
Evans electric in Australia has recently introduced an axial flux machine with a complete conductive rotor. Such a machine was first introduced by Brinner more than 20 years ago and was abandoned because the rotor lacked the required rigidity to withstand the magnetic and centrifugal forces. The Brinner machine is cited in Aura’s patents.
 
Transport Refrigeration (“TRU”)- The main competitors for the all-electric TRU are traditional diesel-based solutions provided by Thermo-king and Carrier. The diesel based comparable systems provided by Thermo-king and Carrier are somewhat less expensive than our AuraGen® all-electric solution, however the diesel solutions require frequent maintenance and the utilization of a separate diesel engine that consumes considerable fuel every operating hour. In addition, the diesel solutions emit harmful emissions that have been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California’s Air Resource Board and others as dangerous pollutants and are increasingly subject to federal and state regulations.
 
The economic and environmental benefits of the AuraGen® solution are greatly amplified in transport refrigeration applications where a separate diesel engine is eliminated. An analysis of our solution for large refrigeration trucks (117,000 trucks across the nation) shows potential annual savings in excess of 26,000 tons of NMHC +NOx, 23,000 tons of CO and over to 1,400 tons of PM. The diesel fuel savings exceed 100,000,000 annual gallons. The above numbers are very conservative since they reflect: (i) the assumption that all refrigeration diesel engines already meet the Tier 4 EPA requirements and (ii) that there are no additional savings from idle reductions. Both assumptions are used as a lower bound for the anticipated savings.
 
Most of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we have. They have larger budgets for research, new product development and marketing, and have long-standing customer relationships. We also compete with many larger and more established companies in the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. Our financial condition has limited our ability to market the AuraGen® aggressively.
 
The AuraGen® uses new technology and because our product is radically different from traditionally available mobile power solutions, users may require lengthy evaluation periods to gain confidence in the product. OEMs and large fleet users also typically require considerable time to make changes to their planning and production.
 
Competitive Advantages of the AuraGen®
 
We believe the AuraGen® system to be a superior product due to its convenience, cost efficiency, fuel efficiency, reliability, flexibility in power output, quality of the electricity generated, and its ability to provide the full power at variable speeds as well as provide load following architecture.
 

● | Smaller Size and Weight. The AuraGen’s® patented breakthrough design is more than 50% smaller and lighter as compared to traditional solutions of comparative output. This ultra-compact design allows the AuraGen® to reside “under-the-hood” of most vehicles and to be powered by a vehicle’s primary engine or power takeoff “PTO”. In comparison, traditional solutions are too large and bulky to be integrated directly into most vehicles and, therefore, require their own independent power source. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


● | Higher Efficiency. The AuraGen® power solution is also more efficient than traditional solutions. due to the significant increase in efficiency of the AuraGen® design over conventional designs Traditional alternators, for example, are at best 50% efficient and require approximately 1 gallon of fuel per each 7.6 kW-hr. The AuraGen® system in comparison is approximately 85%5 efficient and requires approximately only 1 gallon of fuel per each 15.9 kW-hr. Thus, given a need for 10 kW of power, for example, the traditional solution will require approximately 1.3 gallons per hour of fuel while the AuraGen® solution will require only 0.63 gallons per hour for the same output. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The AuraGen® solution is also a load-following solution that further increases efficiency. A load following solution is able to adjust the amount of power output generated at any one moment to mirror the immediate demand. This is an important characteristic as power demands generally fluctuate (sometimes dramatically). Traditional solutions, in comparison, are not load-following and simply provide power at their maximum output rating at all times, irrespective of demand. By producing only that amount of power necessary to meet actual demand, however, the AuraGen® becomes especially efficient whenever less than maximum power output is required.
 

● | Variable Speed. The AuraGen® solution provides full power at near idol. This means that, unlike most other traditional systems, the AuraGen® system’s ability to provide users with full power is largely independent of the speed of the prime mover. The ability to operate at variable speed makes the Aura solution very attractive when the speed of the prime mover varies and is unpredictable, such as in automotive applications. The variable speed solution is a direct consequence of our system architecture where we separated the power generation from the power delivery by the power bus. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Earth-Forward, Green Technology. The AuraGen® system is significantly more environmentally-friendly than traditional generator and mobile power technology. Because of its extreme efficiency and resulting small size, the AuraGen® system utilizes fewer resources to manufacture. Moreover, the AuraGen® uses a vehicle’s primary automotive engine, which is already highly regulated for environmental protection. Traditional mobile power solutions, in comparison, use small, less efficient, auxiliary engines that produce significantly higher levels of emissions per unit of power output than the automobile engine. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In applications, such as transport refrigeration, use of the AuraGen® system eliminates the need for a separate auxiliary diesel engine to run the refrigeration unit; because these auxiliary diesel engines are highly pollutive as to both emissions and noise, the AuraGen® has the potential to meaningfully impact air and noise pollution levels in areas where it is employed.
 

● | Durability; No Scheduled Maintenance. The AuraGen® is not sensitive to temperature or altitude variations and generates the rated power at or near idle engine RPM. The AuraGen® also does not require scheduled maintenance and is offered with a three-year warranty, compared to the typical one-year warranty available for traditional solutions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Targeted Markets
 
It is only recently that the Company has started to reexamine and identify key markets upon which to initially focus as the Company plans to restart operations.
 
(i) A key element of our business plan is focused on electric transport refrigeration. The market is well understood and both social and economic forces are providing an unprecedented opportunity to gain significant market share.

Facilities, Manufacturing Process and Suppliers

During fiscal 2018, our facilities consisted of approximately 20,000 square feet in Stanton, California and an additional storage facility for existing inventory. The Stanton facility is used for some assembly and testing of AuraGen/VIPER systems and is rented on a month-to-month basis. The rent for the Stanton facility is $10,000 per month and the storage facility is an additional $5,000 per month. Our current Stanton facility is not sufficient to support the expected operations and the Company is currently looking for a new facility to be used for production, testing, and engineering as well as needed office space for support staff.
 
Our Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture, of which the Company owns 49% and as further described in “Business—Introduction”, owns facilities of approximately 400,000 square feet, consisting of approximately 200,000 square feet of manufacturing space and 200,000 square feet of general office and engineering space. The Jiangsu Shengfeng facilities are fully paid for and there is no monthly or annual rent associated with these facilities.
 
As the Company is gearing up operations again, we need to renew relationships and contracts with our suppliers or locate suitable new suppliers for subassemblies and other components. Recently, the Company entered into discussions with several of its prior suppliers and is in the process of negotiating settlements of old payables and arranging new supply contracts.
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that ongoing research and development is important to the success of our product in order to utilize the most recent technology, develop additional products and additional uses for existing products, stay current with changes in vehicle manufacture and design and maintain an ongoing advantage over potential competition. Our engineering, research and development costs for fiscal 2018 were approximately $100,000 compared to approximately $30,000 in fiscal 2017.
 
We stopped practically all research and development in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 due to severe cash shortfall; however, we did redesign our Electronic Control Unit (“ECU”) to include the latest state-of-the-art power electronics and processors. Subsequent to year end, we also introduced a new 15,000-watt5 single unit AuraGen® system which offers15,000 watts of power with the rated power at the same size and weight of our physical envelope as the 8-kW solution.
 
We set a modest budget of approximately $750,000 for research and development in fiscal 2019 and based on our anticipated resources. We believe that ongoing research and development is important to the success of our product in order to utilize the most recent technology, develop additional products and additional uses for existing products, stay current with changes in vehicle manufacture and design and maintain an ongoing advantage over potential competition.
 
Patents and Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of trademarks, proprietary know-how, trade secrets, and patents.
 
In the area of electromagnetic technology, we have developed numerous magnetic systems and designs that result in a significant increase of magnetic field density per unit volume that can be converted into useful power energy or work. This increase in field density is a factor of three to four, which, when incorporated into mechanical devices, could result in a significant reduction in size and cost of production for the same performance.
 
The applications of these technological advances are in machines used every day by industrial, commercial, and consumers. We have applied technology to numerous applications in industrial machines, such as generators, motors, actuators, and linear motors.
 
We hold the following patents: Nos. 5,734,217; 6,157,175; 6,700,214; 6,700,802; 8,955,624; with expiration dates in 2018, 2020, 2024,2024 and 2032 respectively. A provisional patent for a water-cooled AuraGen® was granted in March 2013.
 
The following applications are pending: Application 13/849,464 filed in March 2013; and Application 13/781,749 filed in March 2013.

Induction Machine
 
The basic patent covers a new form of induction machine with superior performance in a much smaller size than conventional machines. The solid cast rotor, the shaped magnetic field, the secondary conduction path through the steel and the axial magnetic orientations are key components of this innovation.
Control System
 
This system separates the power generation from the power delivery by introducing a 400 VDC buss. For each cycle of each phase, part of the cycle power is drawn from the bus to run the electronics and energize the coils, while during the other part of the cycle, power is delivered to charge up the buss. The control system must balance all the timing to effect zero voltage change to the buss under dynamic variations of frequency and loads. The ability to optimize in real time the slip frequency is a key innovation in motor and generator control for variable speed, variable frequency, and variable load systems.
 
Bi-Directional Power Supply (“BDP”)
 
The patented ICS system developed by Aura provides a new capability in power systems. The BDP allows a system to use multiple sources of power simultaneously. It is a key component in providing the ability to deliver both AC and DC power simultaneously, as well as the ability to handle large power surges without the need for a throttle controller.
 
At the end of fiscal 2013 and the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we filed five new patent applications related to the AuraGen®. These new patent applications are specifically designed to cover the (i) integration of the AuraGen® power solution with transport refrigeration, (ii) the interface kit of the AuraGen® with prime movers, (iii) a water cooled AuraGen® solution for situations where ventilation is not available, (iv) a unique cable system with safety protection to transfer high power between two moving objects, and (v) a unique clamping of power electronic components to heat sink to ensure good thermal conductivity.
 
Government Regulation 
 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect the Company’s activities, which include, but are not limited to, the areas of labor, intellectual property and ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, environmental, and health and safety. As we recommence operations, our operations will again be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expect to expend resources to maintain compliance with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has approximately four full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the Company engages several independent contractors to support various technical developments. The independent contractors are used on an as-need basis.
Significant Customers
 
We have no significant customers at this time. However, the Company has an initial commitment of approximately $1.25 million to deliver AuraGen® systems and components in 2018. Although we had no sales during the 2018 fiscal year, subsequent to year-end, we have begun fulfilling orders and, as of the date of this filing, have already shipped approximately a dozen units.
Backlog 
 
There are no significant customers as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the Company has an initial order of AuraGen® systems and components representing approximately $1.25 million and deliverable during2018. Management believes that now that the Company is operating again, a significant backlog will develop. No assurances, however, can be given how long it will take the Company, if at all, to develop a significant backlog.

Raw Materials
 
The most important raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are steel, copper, and aluminum. Raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We have no significant long-term supply contracts. When possible, we maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, which we believe contribute to our ability to obtain competitive pricing. The cost of some of our raw materials and shipping costs are dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins. 
 
We enter into standard purchase agreements with certain foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf.
