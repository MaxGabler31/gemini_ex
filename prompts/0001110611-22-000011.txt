Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to transform the way businesses drive revenue and customer engagement through data-rich digital experiences.
We provide a leading, cloud-based platform for digital engagement that delivers insights for revenue growth through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. Our platform’s portfolio of interactive, personalized and content-rich digital experience products creates and captures actionable, real-time data at scale from millions of professionals every month to provide businesses with buying signals and behavioral insights to efficiently convert prospects into customers.
Similar to what has taken place in the business-to-consumer, or B2C, market, our platform for digital engagement empowers business-to-business, or B2B, companies with insights to better personalize their engagement. Large social media platforms have been successful at leveraging experiences and insights of consumers on their platforms to enable B2C companies to effectively understand their potential consumers. While these have been effective in the B2C market, B2B companies often lack deep insights about prospective customers to effectively understand and engage them.
Businesses today primarily use automated solutions, such as digital advertising and email, for marketing. While these automated solutions reach large numbers of prospective customers, they have generally failed to deepen customer engagement because they were designed with the simple purpose of pushing marketing messages in one direction – from the business to the prospective customer. As a result, marketing at scale has become synonymous with spam, which is often ignored by prospective customers and can even undermine the customer relationship. At the same time, prospective customers prefer to do their own research by accessing digital marketing resources before consulting with a salesperson to make a purchasing decision.
For businesses to succeed, we believe their sales and marketing strategies must evolve from the era of automation to the era of engagement. We are strategically positioned to help businesses and their sales and marketing organizations make this transition. Our platform provides an innovative way both to scale digital marketing and deepen prospective customer engagement. We believe our opportunity to help businesses convert digital engagement into revenue will continue to grow as industries modernize their sales and marketing processes. As our customers create more ON24 content-rich experiences, they gather more data directly from prospective customers, which we refer to as first-person data, to help them create a multiplier effect that strengthens their ability to convert prospective customers and generate revenue.
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 2,100 customers. No single customer contributed more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Many of our existing customers expand their usage of our products, and we have continued to add new customers over time, which has allowed us to grow our revenue with them and achieve an annual recurring revenue, or ARR, of $171.4 million for 2021, compared to $153.4 million and $76.9 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Industry Trends
B2B sales and marketing has shifted away from traditional approaches, such as “cold calling,” “snail mail,” industry networking events and in-office visits, to more scalable, digital-based approaches. Going forward, B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers are expected to increasingly occur in digital channels. As they transition to digital-based approaches, businesses are struggling to achieve deep levels of personalized engagement and interactivity. The most common digital marketing tactics that businesses use to operate sales and marketing programs at scale require them to make suboptimal tradeoffs: either annoy their customers with spam, which is frequently ineffective, or use third-party providers to run more expensive marketing campaigns that still may not be engaging or personalized to a prospective customer’s business needs. This has led to frustration and poor returns from digital sales and marketing investments.
The imperative to optimize digital sales and marketing investments to drive revenue conversion has become more important as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives. We believe this digital transformation has fundamentally changed the way businesses engage with their prospective customers, leading to an increased need for innovative methods of B2B engagement at scale to improve sales effectiveness and drive faster revenue growth. The following key trends are impacting sales and marketing strategies today:
•Personalized and interactive digital customer engagement at scale is the new imperative. The ability to engage with large numbers of prospective customers and customers cost-effectively is crucial. As businesses broadly embrace digital transformation initiatives, they are standardizing on cloud-based platforms to transform their sales and marketing strategies. Increased focus on next-generation digital marketing solutions offers our customers an opportunity to drive personalized and interactive prospective customer engagement at scale by aggregating a significant amount of insights on prospective customers. This enables businesses to optimize sales and marketing campaigns and drive revenue growth.
.

•Democratization of content has led prospective customers to self-educate. Ineffective marketing tactics coupled with broad availability of relevant content across multiple channels have shifted the mindset of B2B prospective customers. Because prospective customers are now self-educating by accessing information on products and brands in advance of purchasing decisions, marketers must adapt by identifying and providing relevant content to their prospective customers earlier in the sales process. We believe this will necessarily shift greater investment into content-rich, interactive platforms for digital engagement and away from low-touch marketing automation strategies.
•Traditional automated marketing approaches are increasingly ineffective. Traditional automated marketing tactics have limited effectiveness at engaging prospective customers because they are generic, intrusive and irrelevant. Having a limited understanding of a prospective customer’s intent and interest leads to largely ineffective, impersonal marketing, wasted sales and marketing investment and frustrated prospective customers. 
•Data privacy requirements are constraining automated digital marketing. Data privacy has become a fundamental area of focus for regulatory bodies given the digital transformation initiatives taking place and the plethora of spam used today. As privacy laws continue to expand and evolve, this puts pressure on traditionally automated methods of marketing at scale that have traditionally been highly dependent on information obtained from third parties. As a result, we believe there will be increased focus on engaging with customers directly and driving engagement through first party insights and integrations.
The new norms of digital transformation and targeting self-educating prospective customers have accelerated the need for cloud platforms that deliver personalized and interactive customer engagement at scale to drive revenue.
Limitations of Traditional Approaches to Customer Engagement at Scale
Businesses have struggled to adapt their marketing strategies for the era of digital engagement where interactions with prospective customers happen online. Traditional marketing tactics and general-purpose communication platforms suffer from many limitations, including:
•Failure to create content-rich, interactive experiences for prospective customers. As prospective customers increasingly self-educate, creating personalized, content-rich and interactive experiences is critical to generate engagement. Typical online sales and marketing strategies are built upon one-way communication from the marketer to their prospective customers, offering no opportunity for developing a meaningful exchange nor empowering prospective customers to dictate their own buying process.
•Limited opportunity for engagement, resulting in less prospective customer data. Highly engaging and interactive experiences generate valuable signals about prospective customers’ buying intentions that can inform the sales process and improve efficiency. To be able to capture and respond to those buying signals, businesses need the ability to track, record, contextualize and analyze prospective customer behavior in real-time. While in-person events, such as business conferences, can sometimes create engaging experiences, they do not allow for the automated and efficient collection of first-person data and are expensive to organize. General-purpose online meeting tools can enable businesses to reach many people at once, but they lack the engagement, analytics and first-person data that are needed to drive revenue. Meanwhile, traditional marketing automation tools collect only superficial data such as click rates that deliver limited understanding into what prospective customers want, what messages are resonating and how to more deeply engage and inform prospective customers that are seeking to learn more.
•Ineffective insights to convert prospects into customers. Insights about prospective customers are only valuable to businesses to the extent that they help convert prospects into customers. Providing contextualized and easy to access information to sales teams in real-time can materially improve their efficiency and improve revenue conversion. Technologies such as general purpose communications and collaboration tools have provided convenient alternatives to hosting physical meetings but were not designed to easily integrate into the broader sales and marketing systems that businesses use, and thus these tools have limited use in connecting real-time customer interaction with a business’s broader sales and marketing strategies.
•Inability to utilize behavioral insights to dynamically personalize content. By gaining insights into their prospective customers’ behavior and engagement, businesses are able to understand and measure the performance of their digital experiences. This understanding provides critical intelligence to optimize the subsequent creation and delivery of other digital experiences. Traditional approaches typically fail to utilize customer behaviors to dynamically adjust content and enable content personalization. 
•In-person events are resource intensive and exist in a discrete moment. A business conference exists in a discrete moment in time, is expensive, and cannot be re-created. In these scenarios, businesses only have one opportunity to engage with prospective customers at scale, and their return on investment is limited. Furthermore, the expectation in today’s new market dynamic is that all events have a digital component and that audiences are able to choose how they engage.

Our Platform and Key Differentiators
Our leading cloud-based platform for digital engagement enables businesses to convert customer engagement into revenue through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences that are backed by analytics and an ecosystem of third-party integrations.
Our portfolio of ON24 Experience products include:
•ON24 Elite: live, interactive webinar experience that engages prospective customers in real-time and can also be made available in an on-demand format.
•ON24 Breakouts: live breakout room experience that facilitates networking, collaboration and interactivity between users.
•ON24 Go Live: live, interactive video event experience that enables presenters and attendees to engage face-to-face in real-time and can also be made available in an on-demand format.
•ON24 Virtual Conference: live, large scale, managed virtual event experience that engages prospective customers in real-time and can also be made available in an on-demand format.
•ON24 Engagement Hub: always-on, rich multimedia content experience that prospective customers can engage in anytime, anywhere.
•ON24 Target: personalized and curated, rich landing page experience that engages specific segments of prospective customers to drive a desired action.
Our ON24 Experience products are backed by our solutions, including:
•ON24 Intelligence: analytics backbone that captures first-person data to power the insights, benchmarking, reporting and artificial intelligence and machine learning, or AI/ML, engine within our platform.
•ON24 Connect: ecosystem of third-party application integrations.
•ON24 Services and Platform Support: a portfolio of professional services that provide consulting and support for product and platform adoption.
We believe the key differentiators of our platform are:
•Designed to drive interactive customer experiences. Our platform was built to power a new kind of customer engagement – highly interactive real-time digital experiences that can scale engagement from hundreds to thousands of prospective customers simultaneously. Unlike spam, which is often ignored, our digital experiences engage prospective customers and encourage them to ask questions and learn about a business’s products and offerings more broadly. This real-time interaction is the foundation of our modern engagement platform and aligns with how B2B prospective customers are seeking to self-educate.
•Interactive customer engagement creates highly valuable customer insight data. Unlike more traditional approaches, creating and measuring customer engagement and interaction is at the center of our platform. Through our products, our customers can create interactive experiences that foster active engagement with their prospective customers and gather data in real time. This enables our customers to obtain rich, valuable insights and predictive analytics as well as integrate the resulting data and insights into their business applications.
•Prospective customer insights drive more efficient conversion of pipeline to revenue. The customer engagement and interaction data gathered through our platform enables businesses to derive deep insights about prospective customer behavior. These insights can drive higher-quality pipeline and ultimately better revenue conversion for our customers. Through our ecosystem of integrations with third-party marketing automation, customer relationship management, or CRM, and business intelligence, or BI, platforms, our customers can leverage insights derived through our platform to more intelligently engage with prospective customers in real-time.
•Flywheel effect drives continuous optimization. Years of capturing engagement insights have provided us with a deep understanding of how to best design digital experiences that engage prospective customers and generate more impactful revenue conversion. The more of our content-rich experiences that our customers create for their prospective customers to engage with, the more first-person data that our customers are able to collect in return. By leveraging AI/ML, our platform enables businesses to use this data to derive highly relevant and deep insights that fuel more personalization in future content experiences, strengthening the engagement they create and further enhancing the quality of the interaction data and insights derived through our platform. This combination of rich prospective customer data and AI/ML becomes a flywheel for better content creation, improved customer experiences, greater customer intelligence and enhanced revenue conversion.
.

•Experiences that can be repurposed and continuously drive engagement to maximize return on investment. Our customers are able to continuously drive results because ON24 digital experiences remain interactive and can continue to engage their prospective customers well after the initial live event ends. The experiences created through our platform are designed with persistent interactivity which gives our customers the ability to engage their prospective customers in either a live or on-demand experience. This flexibility makes it possible to repurpose and reuse digital experiences many times over with no incremental cost.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we have significant competitive strengths that will enable us to extend our market leadership position, including:
•Category defining platform for customer engagement at scale. We created one of the first cloud platforms for businesses to deliver interactive, data driven webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. We believe we have a first-mover advantage because our proprietary and proven platform has enabled our customers to build effective systems for digital engagement that generate high return on investment.
•Cloud-based system of engagement. Our cloud-based platform powers our customers with several key marketing capabilities: creating digital experiences, deploying them at scale, collecting numerous data points on their prospective customers, and leveraging this data to further personalize subsequent experiences. Consolidating these services onto one platform allows our customers to gather a more cohesive understanding of their prospective customers and take more targeted actions to more effectively convert prospects into customers. As a result, businesses no longer need to rely on a combination of standalone products.
•Broad, rich dataset and AI/ML capabilities power valuable insights. Our platform enables highly interactive experiences, giving our customers access to behavioral data that signals buying intent. By leveraging our AI/ML capabilities, our customers can derive valuable and actionable insights in order to optimize their sales and marketing strategies. For example, we help our customers understand what features of a digital experience drive the most engagement with prospective customers. Our customers can also use our platform to benchmark themselves against others in their industry to understand where they can improve. In addition, our customers can more effectively reach their prospects and customers by leveraging our AI/ML capabilities to predict how best to personalize digital experiences for particular customers based on their prior behavior and interactions on our platform.
•Enterprise grade, highly scalable cloud platform. Our cloud-based platform has been developed to enable enterprise-grade scalability. This includes options and features to enable our customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align to their needs as well as integrations with a broad ecosystem of third-party applications. Our platform is available in over 20 languages and can be utilized seamlessly across multinational sales and marketing organizations. Our customers are able to use our platform to engage their prospective customers in multiple regions by supporting different streaming protocols, multilingual translation and closed captioning.
•Growing base of customers across verticals. We have a large and diverse set of customers across a broad set of industries. We have grown our customer base from approximately 760 customers as of December 31, 2015 to over 2,100 customers as of December 31, 2021. We intend to leverage our land and expand model to further penetrate customers across these verticals.
•Superior, dedicated customer service. Our solutions are designed to be easy to use, featuring drag-and-drop and other similar tools simplifying implementation by our customers. We offer technical support, chat support and live webinar experience emergency support that is available to our customers 24/7. Our platform support and customer success teams are organized into a “follow the sun model” to ensure consistent and reliable service across the globe.
Our Market Opportunity
We estimate that the current TAM for our solutions is approximately $44 billion worldwide annually. We calculate our TAM by initially estimating the total number of companies that our platform and products can support in the United States across separate bands measured by number of employees: Enterprise, which includes companies with more than 2,000 employees, and Commercial, which includes companies with less than 2,000 employees, which we further divide into Mid-Market companies with 200-1,999 employees, and small and midsize, or SMB, companies with 50-199 employees, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau for 2017. We then apply an average annual value to the companies in each band. This value was calculated using internally generated data for annual recurring revenue, or ARR, as of June 30, 2021 for the top 25% of our customers by ARR that subscribe to two or more of our products, within each of the Enterprise and Mid-Market bands, and the top 25% by ARR of all our customers within the SMB band. We believe these calculations are representative of the current potential spend on our solutions by customers and prospective customers. We multiplied the total number of companies within each band by the calculated annual value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current annual estimated market opportunity in the United States of $22 billion. We believe the market opportunity for our solutions outside the United States is at least as large.
.

Our Growth Strategy
We intend to drive the growth of our business and the adoption of our solutions by executing the following strategies:
•Drive new customer acquisition. We believe our market is still relatively underpenetrated and that through scaling our sales force and through specialized and aligned sales teams focused on the Enterprise and Commercial markets globally, we can accelerate new customer acquisition across the substantial Commercial market.
•Expand within existing customers. Our land and expand model is expected to drive expansion of new subscriptions within our existing customer base by selling subscriptions to additional parts of existing customers’ organizations, expanding into new regional divisions and upselling new solutions. In addition, we plan to develop new applications for our platform, including partner training and employee recruiting and forms of indirect marketing, such as education, enrollment and benefits programs.
•Continue to increase attachments and develop new solutions for specific use cases. We expect our business to grow both through increasing attachments for existing solutions and selling our existing customers new solutions that we develop in the future. For example, we have developed a differentiated feature set for our customers that use our platform to conduct online continuing education programs and issue accredited certifications. Our ecosystem of third-party integrations includes business applications in specific industries. We plan to continually develop new solutions that enhance the functionality of our platform and products, improve our customers’ experiences and drive engagement with their prospective customers. 
•Expand into new regions. We believe the expansion of our platform in international markets is a significant opportunity. We plan to open additional offices in targeted geographies to support our international expansion and also to launch additional platform capacity in Europe to support our European expansion.
•Identify and pursue inorganic growth opportunities. We plan to opportunistically evaluate and acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies that expand our platform, add different categories of experiences and support new use cases for our customers. We believe well-selected acquisitions may add significant value to our platform and expand the ability of our customers to gather engagement data to help them convert their prospective customers into revenue

Our Technology and Infrastructure
Our platform and products have been developed to enable enterprise-grade scalability, performance, and reliability, designed to address all the complexities that come with live, interactive engagement with large audiences of prospective customers. Our platform has two main parts: a web application stack, and a streaming infrastructure stack, running on two co-located data centers in the United States and one in the European Union (EU).
Our web application stack processes requests from web browsers and APIs. Our streaming infrastructure stack processes live signal acquisition from our customers, encodes it, and delivers it to audiences via a redundant set of content delivery networks. The streaming infrastructure stack is designed to accept inputs from our customers on a wide variety of devices, combine them into an online virtual bridge, and to incorporate controls into the ON24 Elite Studio experience for presenters. The bridged signal is then encoded and distributed to diverse global audiences, who can access it as part of an online experience on desktop and mobile devices. This presentation contains video along with other interactive components, all synchronized and controlled by our customers. We continue to transition more of our capabilities to a hybrid cloud infrastructure, which we believe will enhance our platform’s flexibility and scalability.
We built our platform and products to address the robust performance demanded by large, multinational enterprises in the following ways:
•Performance and scalability: Our Cloud and Network Operations team runs this application in three data centers. This configuration has proven both scalable and cost effective. Our application architecture allows us to independently scale the systems that handle heavier loads, with a lightweight load-balancers routing traffic to additional machines as needed. With leading enterprise components, we expect our architecture to scale readily without any significant change as our business expands. 
•Privacy and compliance: Our platform includes features and options designed to support compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and other privacy laws, and provides options and features to enable customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align to their needs and relevant legal requirements. For example, our platform enables customers to implement tailored notice and consent language, customize registration forms and obtain consent for marketing and other processing activities. In addition, our flexible APIs allow businesses to build solutions to automate compliance with certain data subject requests. 
•Security: We conduct regular penetration tests, web vulnerability scans, and code reviews to enhance the security of our platform.

We compete for customers with a number of different types of companies that offer a variety of products and services, including meeting tools, webinar software, virtual event software, video portal software, content management software, physical events, physical event software and digital marketing tools. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer. Many of our current and potential competitors have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Our solutions face competition. For example, a number of web-based meeting, webinar, and virtual event software products are offered by companies such as Zoom, LogMeIn, Intrado, Microsoft, Cisco, Cvent and Hopin. Many of these products have significantly lower prices. Although many of these companies do not currently offer products with real-time engagement features that gather the types and extent of actionable data that we gather, many of these companies have significantly greater resources and may be able to introduce similar products in the future. Additionally, we operate in a market characterized by an increasing number of new and competitive entrants. As we introduce new solutions, and with the introduction of new technologies, products and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.
.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are:
•functionality in providing rich, interactive digital experiences;
•ability to gather near real-time data insights for marketers;
•breadth of functionality within a single platform;
•ease of use and reliability; 
•cloud-based architecture;
•scalability;
•security, privacy and compliance;
•integration into leading marketing automation, CRM and BI platforms; and
•global, always available customer service and support.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We primarily rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a combination of patent, trade secret and domain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In the United States and abroad, as of December 31, 2021, we had 16 issued patents and 31 pending patent applications, the earliest of which expires in 2027. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Our trademarks and service marks include our name and logo, as well as various marketing slogans. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information.
These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated.
Regulatory Considerations
The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Businesses use our platform to engage with and market to their prospects and customers. In doing so, these businesses: (a) upload, broadcast, collect and store data and content within our platform, subject to relatively few general restrictions imposed by us, aside from the technical capabilities and limitation inherent in our platform, (b) use tools and reports available in our platform to access analytics and insights about attendees, experiences and content, and (c) personalize content and experiences to prospects and customers. This presents potential compliance challenges to our business and operations because we do not control customer content and information practices within our platform. Thus, we cannot ensure that information collection and processing by or on behalf of customers, within our platform, complies with applicable privacy, data protection and other laws. Similarly, we cannot ensure that customer content and use of our platform does not infringe or violate rights of privacy or intellectual property rights. At the same time, given the developing and varied nature of privacy and intellectual property laws globally, we cannot guarantee that ON24 would never be subject to potential or actual claims or enforcement actions associated with customer content or use of our platform. Thus, both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and take steps to respond to a host of legal, compliance and risk issues regarding the data stored and processed by customers on our platform. These include, without limitation, the following:
Privacy, Data Protection and Security
Businesses use our platform to facilitate better engagement with their customers and prospects, derive insights about content and usage, and provide more meaningful and targeted experiences and content. These capabilities rely on collection and processing of information from and about customers and prospects that interact with the business or its content on our platform. As a result, compliance with laws and regulations regarding data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data breaches, and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of personal data, which we refer to as privacy laws, are critical to our compliance and risk strategy. Globally, numerous jurisdictions have passed or are actively considering new or amended privacy laws. As a result, privacy laws are increasing in number, enforcement, and fines and other penalties. Beyond legislative developments, decisions by courts and regulatory bodies relating to privacy laws can also have a significant impact on us and other businesses that operate across international jurisdictions.
.

In some cases, privacy laws apply directly to both ON24 and our customers and in other cases our customers pass through compliance obligations and requirements to us contractually. Further, under some privacy laws, ON24 may be considered a “processor” or a “service provider” and our customers a “controller” or “business,” while other privacy laws may not clearly distinguish between such roles. In all cases, however, ON24 must monitor, respond to and address privacy laws and related compliance, whether to ensure its own compliance or enable compliant use of its platform by ON24 customers. In general, our failure to adequately safeguard data adequately, address privacy compliance, or comply with our security and privacy commitments to customers could subject us, not only to contractual liability to customers and direct liability under privacy laws, but also to reputational harm and regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under U.S. (federal and state) and international laws and regulations relating to consumer protection and unfair business practices. More particularly, certain privacy law developments could have significant impacts to our platform and business. For example, privacy laws that restrict the use of personal information for marketing purposes or the tracking of individuals’ online activities (such as the EU’s proposed ePrivacy Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act), could expose us to additional regulatory burdens or necessitate changes to our platform or certain features. In addition, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws that impose data localization requirements or cross border data transfer restrictions on certain data. As with most cloud-based solutions, restrictions on the transfer of platform data outside of the originating jurisdiction pose particular challenges that could result in additional costs or otherwise impact platform use.
With the evolving legal landscape, the scope, interpretation and enforcement of privacy laws could change and new or amended laws may take effect. As a result, the associated burdens and compliance costs on us and our platform could increase in the future. Although we continue to monitor and respond to privacy legal developments and have invested in addressing major privacy law developments (such as the GDPR and the CCPA), it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the effect of these developments on our platform and business.
Copyrights
U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws protect the rights of third parties from infringement of their intellectual property. Our customers and their users can generally use our platform to upload and present a wide variety of content. We maintain a copyright infringement policy and respond to takedown requests by third-party intellectual property right owners that might result from content uploaded to our platform. As our business expands to other countries, we must also respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including takedown and cease-and-desist notices in foreign languages, and we must build infrastructure to support these processes. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, also applies to our business. This statute provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright-protected technologies but includes a safe harbor that is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites or hosting content that infringes copyrights of others. The copyright infringement policies that we have implemented for our platform are intended to satisfy the DMCA safe harbor.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 717 full-time employees. Of these employees, 552 are based in the United States and 165 are based in international locations. The members of our management team and our board of directors come from diverse backgrounds, and we seek to attract and recruit diverse, talented, experienced and motivated employees. In order to continue to develop and improve our platform, we must continue to invest in attracting, developing and retaining key talent. We monitor our progress with human capital metrics such as turnover, time to fill open roles and rate of internally developed talent. Our brand, market position, reputation for innovation and culture support our ability to recruit and retain talented employees across our departments.
