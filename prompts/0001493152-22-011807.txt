ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
Harbor Custom Development, Inc. is a real estate development company involved in all aspects of the land development cycle including land acquisition, entitlements, development, construction of project infrastructure, single and multi-family vertical construction, marketing, sales, and management of various residential projects in Washington, California, Texas, and Florida.
 
As a land developer and builder of single-family homes, luxury homes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments, our business strategy is to acquire and develop land strategically based on an understanding of population growth patterns, entitlement restrictions and land use evaluation, infrastructure development, and geo-economic forces. We endeavor to acquire land with scenic views to develop and sell residential lots, new home communities, townhomes and multi-story condominium or apartment properties within a 20- to 60-minute commute of some of the nation’s fastest-growing metro employment corridors.
 
We are leading the real estate industry as the first national land developer and home builder accepting payment in the form of cryptocurrency for our properties.
 
Our portfolio of land, lots, home plans, and finishing options, coupled with a historic low inventory of residential and multi-family housing in our principal geographic areas, provide an opportunity for us to increase revenue and overall market share. In addition to our single-family residential projects, we plan to build and sell townhomes, condominiums, and apartments and anticipate commencement of land development and construction on ten multi-family sites in Washington and Florida in 2022. (See “Item 2. Properties.”) In an effort to strategically control the expanding needs of our corporate team, we signed a lease on October 5, 2021 for a new office space in Tacoma, Washington and expect to move our headquarters in the second quarter of 2022. This office space is designed with a hybrid workforce in mind and takes into account employment trends that arose after the COVID-19 global pandemic, specifically the increase in hybrid or remote employees.
 
Since 2015, we have grown quickly with increasing revenues each year of operation. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our total revenues were $72.4 million and $50.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our backlogs of fully executed contracts for the sale of developed residential lots and single-family homes were $13.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Our fee build backlogs as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $10.0 million and $0, respectively.
 
It is customary for us to sign purchase and sale agreements that contain a due diligence period which allows us time, usually between 30 and 60 days, to evaluate the acquisition. At times, through our due diligence efforts, we find that a property is not suitable for purchase due to economic forces, zoning issues, or other matters. If we determine that a property is not suitable for our desired purposes, we terminate the purchase and sale agreement. After termination within the due diligence period, our earnest money is returned to us.
 
Our infrastructure development division efficiently constructs a diverse range of residential communities and improved lots in a cost-effective manner. We own and lease heavy equipment, which we utilize to build and develop residential subdivisions and multi-family communities. The equipment is primarily used for land clearing, site development, public and private road improvements, installation of wet utilities such as sewer, water, and storm sewer lines, in addition to construction of dry utility lines for power, gas, telephone, and cable service providers.
 
We are a general contractor and construct single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and apartments utilizing a base of employees in conjunction with third-party subcontractors.

Entitled Land, Developed Lot, and Home Sales
 
In 2021, we had three entitled land sales and sold 157 developed lots and 30 homes. The three entitled land sales represented 29% of total revenue in 2021. The 157 developed lot sales represented 37% of total revenue in 2021. Our 2021 home sales represented 24% of total revenue in 2021 and the selling prices for these homes ranged from $0.5 million to $0.8 million.
 
In 2020, we sold 104 developed lots and 76 homes. The 104 developed lot sales represented 25% of total revenue in 2020. Our 2020 single-family home selling prices ranged from $0.4 million to $0.8 million.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is driven by the following:
 
Offer Diversified Product Portfolio from Single to Multi-family Communities
 
Our expertise allows for a diversified product strategy that enables us to better serve a wide range of buyers, adapt quickly to changing market conditions, and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. We are equipped to build to the surrounding communities’ needs, including single family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and apartments. This flexible business model allows us to target a wide and diverse range of customers, from those looking at lower income housing options through condominiums and apartments, to those seeking entry-level through luxury single-family homes.
Provide Superior Quality and an Excellent Homeowner Experience
 
Our operating philosophy is to provide a positive and memorable experience to our homeowners. We seek to maximize customer satisfaction by offering beautiful homes built with quality materials and exceptional craftsmanship, thoughtfully designed floor plans, and located with a 20- to 60-minute commute from major metropolitan areas. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency which reduces the homeowner’s environmental impact and energy costs. Our competitive edge in the selling process focuses on the home’s features, design, and premium locations with scenic views. Our goal is not just to build houses, but also to create desirable communities through superior design, location, and execution.
 
New home-buyers’ needs are met across multiple communities and price points by maintaining a substantial inventory of ready-to-build lots and designer home plans. From move-up buyers needing more space for their growing families or $1.5 million-plus luxury homes, our business model enables buyers to overcome the significant inventory shortage and pricing challenges in high-growth metropolitan markets.

Provide Diverse Products for Multi-family Living with Superior Quality
 
The significant appreciation in rental rates over the past year, combined with moderate capitalization rates and low inventory of rental housings in our target markets, have created a substantial opportunity to expand our product portfolio within the multi-family vertical space.
 
Our product agnostic building model provides us the flexibility to accommodate the current rapidly changing market conditions. We are equipped to build to the surrounding communities’ needs from, first-time homebuyers searching for a starter townhome, condominium, or apartment to institutional investors looking for large tracts of entitled land, developed lots, or multi-family apartment projects. This flexible business model provides us with a competitive advantage and differentiates us from our peers.
 
Our inventory of entitled multi-family communities located 20 to 60 minutes from major metropolitan employment corridors, coupled with a low inventory of rental and first-time residential housing in our principal geographic areas, currently provide an opportunity to increase revenue and overall market share.
 
Focus on Efficient Operations
 
We strive to control costs through a disciplined planning process. Detailed budgets are prepared for all cost categories. Budgets are closely monitored throughout the building process as we continue to revisit and update the budget on an ongoing basis. Many components are provided by subcontractors and significant effort is expended to assure that scopes of work are complete and inclusive. Contract variances and change orders are closely scrutinized for appropriateness. At the sale and closing of each home in a project, the estimated and final margins are compared and variances are identified and investigated to better control costs on future homes in the project. We believe our disciplined process of setting realistic budgets and expectations, monitoring, and evaluating them and making any necessary adjustments to correct deviations going forward enables us to prudently control our costs.
Strategic Partnerships/Cost Control
 
Our business model is flexible and facilitates partnering with companies that specialize in their local markets, including residential builders, general contractors, and land developers. By partnering with these specialists, our cost structure can be closely managed. Further, all internal shared services are centralized at our corporate office in Washington state. Centralized functions include purchasing, accounting, finance, operations, legal, human resources, transaction coordination, and permitting. Centralizing these important functions keeps our infrastructure costs under tight control.
Our Markets
 
Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition of land for development purposes and the design, construction, and sale of residential lots, single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and apartments in Washington, California, Florida, and Texas.
Our Products
 
We offer a diverse portfolio of finished lots, single-family and multi-family communities, including townhomes, condominiums, and apartments. Being product-agnostic provides us great flexibility to maintain appropriate consumer product and price level diversification for the specific markets we serve. We focus on underserved consumer groups for each of our locations while attempting to diversify so that our land portfolio is not overly concentrated in any one area. Building at multiple price points enables us to adjust to changing consumer and market demands quickly. Buyer profiles are developed for each market and our communities are designed with the specific needs of those buyers in mind.

Land Acquisition and Development Process
 
We execute an integrated business model to monetize land during three distinct stages of the development cycle. As a result, risks may be mitigated by providing multiple exit points for our real estate assets.

● | Sale of Entitled Land – Property sold following the controlling jurisdiction’s approval of a permitted residential use or other use, as applicable. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sale of Developed Lots - Property sold after infrastructure completed including all roads, sidewalks, and utilities. 
● | Sale of Completed Building Product – Property sold following construction of a single-family home, townhome, condominium, or apartment. 

 
We also provide services as fee build revenues to construct the required infrastructure so that houses can be developed on the lots.
 
Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps to reduce development and market cycle risk:
 

● | review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title reviews; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | complete due diligence on the land parcel prior to committing to the acquisition; 
● | prepare detailed budgets for all cost categories; 
● | complete environmental reviews and third-party market studies; and 
● | evaluate economic feasibility within the context of the above strategies. 

 
Before purchasing large land tracts, we engage outside engineers and consultants to help review the proposed acquisition and assist with community and home design.
 
Home Building, Marketing, and Sales Process
 
Our philosophy is to provide a positive, memorable experience to homeowners by actively engaging them in the building process and by enhancing communication, knowledge, and satisfaction. Options are available to suit individual and family lifestyle needs. Home designs include features such as outdoor living spaces, one-story living, and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to universal design needs. Our homes are engineered for energy-efficiency which is aimed at reducing impact on the environment and lowering energy costs to our homebuyers.
 
We sell our homes through independent real estate brokers. Sales representatives and independent brokers assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of options, if applicable. We, along with our design consultants, strive for superior design choices that coincide with the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers.
 
Our selling agents and brokers advertise directly to potential homebuyers through the internet and in newspapers and trade publications, as well as through marketing brochures and newsletters.
 
Construction may start when a customer has selected a lot, chosen a floor plan, and received preliminary mortgage approval. However, construction usually begins prior to that point in order to satisfy market demand for completed homes and to facilitate construction scheduling and/or cost savings. Home building revenues are recognized when home sales are finished and closed and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.
 
Our sales contracts typically require an earnest money deposit. Buyers are generally required to pay an additional deposit when they select options or upgrades for their homes. The amount of earnest money required varies between markets and communities, but typically averages 2.5% of the total purchase price of the home. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when homebuyers cancel their contracts with us, following a stipulated period of time, we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits. Our sales contracts may also include contingencies that permit homebuyers to cancel and receive a partial refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified time period or if they cannot sell an existing home. The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer varies depending on customer preferences, permit approval, and construction cycles.

Customer Relations, Quality Control, and Warranty Programs
 
We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to reduce building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors we employ are monitored with regular inspections and evaluations, seeking to ensure that all standards are met.
 
We maintain quality control and customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, closing, and post-closing periods. These employees are also responsible for providing post-sale customer support. Our quality and service initiatives include providing customers with a comprehensive walk-through of their home prior to closing.
 
Warranty Programs
 
We provide each homeowner with product warranties covering workmanship and materials for one year from the time of closing and warranties covering structural systems for six years from the time of closing in connection with our general liability insurance policy. We believe our warranty program meets or exceeds terms customarily offered in the home building industry. The subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with customary warranties on their workmanship.
Materials
 
When constructing our projects, we use various materials and components. The typical build time for our single-family homes is six to ten months and our multi-family communities is 15 to 24 months, during which time materials are subject to price fluctuations. Such price fluctuations are caused by several factors, including seasonal variations in availability, international trade disputes and resulting tariffs, and increased demand for materials due to the improved market. The current state of the global supply chain has the potential to increase our cost on certain materials such as quartz slabs for countertops, finished hardware, lighting fixtures, appliances, and engineered hardwood used in residential flooring. While it has had a minimal effect on our sourcing of materials and supplier components thus far, the continuing global supply chain disruptions, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could impact our sourcing needs in the future.
 
Our material suppliers are subcontractors that are licensed, bonded, and insured. Each subcontractor provides a bid for the work required and is awarded a contract based on price, reputation, and ability to meet our time frames.
 
Our material suppliers provide us with credit terms for materials used in the construction of our projects. Credit terms typically range from a 30 to 60-day payment cycle following their delivery or installation of a product or service.
 
COVID-19
 
On March 25, 2020, the Governor of Washington imposed a complete moratorium on construction of single-family low-risk construction in the State (the “Moratorium”). We had to cease construction operations on that date. The Moratorium was lifted on April 24, 2020, provided that safety measures were implemented, including the creation of a COVID-19 safety plan, exposure response procedure plan, and mandatory construction site safety meetings. We implemented the safety measures and re-started housing construction activities. The possibility remains that the Governor could impose new or additional requirements or restrict or completely halt construction again depending on the development of the COVID-19 infection rate.
 
We have not experienced any material sales contract cancellations due to the pandemic or otherwise. We have experienced minimal supply-chain issues with both cabinetry and appliances related to COVID-19. As of the date of this Annual Report, our projects are on-schedule and operations are not being materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seasonality
 
We experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings, and other market factors. Since it typically takes six to ten months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs, and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occurs during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
 
While the leasing side of multi-family communities can experience some seasonality during the winter holiday months, the construction side typically doesn’t show seasonality patterns. The building process typically takes 15 to 24 months, depending on the size of the project, the site development scope, and other market factors.
 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to numerous local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subject to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development, or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
 
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given construction site vary according to the site’s location, its environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. From time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions imposed on us may increase our costs. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.
 
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, in those cases where an endangered species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. To date, we have never experienced a significant environmental issue.

Competition and Market Factors
 
We face competition in the homebuilding industry, which is characterized by relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, home buying customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor. Increased competition may prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes, apartments, townhomes, condominiums, or deliver finished lots, or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, or lead to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our margins and revenues. Competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products and because they are or may be significantly larger, have a longer operating history, and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us, may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate. We also compete with other homebuilders that have longer standing relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or plan to operate.
Human Capital
 
As of March 21, 2022, we had 80 full-time employees; 41 of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
The safety and well-being of our employees are important to us. We take guidance from the State of Washington regarding COVID-19 protocols in the workplace. Some employees that are able to perform their job functions remotely are working remotely. However, this may change if there are any other developments in state or local laws and on a case-by-case basis.
