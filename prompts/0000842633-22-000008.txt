In each of our businesses, including businesses we have acquired, we have members of our leadership team that have served the vast majority of their careers, and have extensive and often times unique experience, in the industries we operate. The TriMas management team is focused and committed to continuously improving Company performance and growing shareholder value. Management compensation is tied to financial results through short-term incentive plans, long-term equity incentive programs and Company-established stock ownership guidelines. 
Our Strategy
Guided by our experienced management team, we are focused on the following components that comprise our core strategy: 
•Leverage the TriMas Business Model.  The TriMas Business Model ("TBM") serves as the platform to manage our diverse set of businesses under a common set of standards focused on driving long-term exceptional performance. Through the TBM, we set near- and long-term performance objectives and goals, and utilize a reliable communication and escalation process that provides for flexibility and adjustments if market expectations change. A key tenet of the TBM is our commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement. We leverage the Kaizen methodology, which is predicated on engaging our employees to identify cost effective ways to improve all aspects of our businesses, throughout our manufacturing operations and support services. We believe our operating performance will continue to benefit from the use of Kaizen as a means to drive our decision-making and investment processes. In addition to continuous improvement and goal setting, the TBM is also focused on environmental, health and safety, talent development, and flawless new product and process launches.
•Accelerate Growth through Innovation. We continue to invest in organic growth in our most compelling market segments with the highest long-term return potential. We intend to leverage our brands, expand our product offerings to current and new customers, and introduce innovative products to meet our customers' needs and help solve their challenges. We operate under a disciplined approach to defend and expand our product offerings, and grow our business over the longer term. In addition to product innovation, we also value process innovation and believe we can solidify our customer relationships using new innovative processes and manufacturing "know-how" to improve our quality, speed to develop and commercialize, sustainability and overall competitiveness, increasing customer satisfaction, as well as our performance.
•Augment Growth with Strategic Acquisitions. We believe TriMas, through its relatively low debt profile and its strong free cash flow, is uniquely positioned to enhance organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our acquisition priority is to build out the Packaging platform, continuing our initiative to increase TriMas’ weight in packaging-related end markets, which comprise more than 60% of consolidated net sales in 2021, as well as explore opportunities to further expand our Aerospace platform. We typically seek to acquire adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers and end markets, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. 
•Drive Enhanced Cash Conversion.  We leverage the TBM to drive management’s decision-making processes to achieve our growth and profitability targets, as well as drive our businesses toward achieving market-leading returns and cash flow conversion. We believe establishing well-defined strategies, executing against annual goals and long-range targets, operating in a data-driven, fact-based environment, and awarding our team on annual cash flow generation will allow us to expand our free cash flow and create shareholder value. We plan to use this cash for reinvestment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions and other capital allocation actions, such as share buybacks and dividends, which we initiated in 2021.
•Engage our People.  We believe our talented and dedicated global team is the foundation of our success. We strive to be a great employer through our demonstrated commitment to employee safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, talent development and workplace culture. We embrace the tools of Kaizen and foster a culture of employee engagement to drive performance improvements, operational excellence and a sustainable future.
•Focus on Sustainability in Everything We Do. We view sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") practices as important components of our culture and rooted in our core values representing who we are as a company. We proactively seek new ways to make progress in each of the four key areas of our sustainability strategy: Governance & Ethics, People, Environment and Products. We believe that sustainability is broader than caring for the environment, and encompasses care for our employees, as well as the communities where we live and work. It means continuously enhancing our products and our processes to make the world a better place. We strive to incorporate the concept of sustainability into our decision-making model, and continue to increase the importance of sustainability in everything we do.

Our customers, including larger consumer products customers, often desire supply capability and a manufacturing footprint close to their end markets which results in more efficient supply chains, reduced carbon footprint and better sustainability. In light of recent market forces that impact logistics, we are expanding our North American manufacturing presence by launching a new, highly automated facility in New Albany, Ohio, which will be operational in 2022. This new facility will enable TriMas Packaging to shift production of a variety of products currently produced outside of the United States and provide significant incremental capacity for new business growth closer to our customers in North America as needed. To serve our customers in Asia, we have design and manufacturing capacity and offer highly engineered dispensing solutions through locations in China, India and Vietnam, and have increased our Asian market sales coverage. Additionally, TriMas Packaging opened a facility in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, during 2017, to provide incremental manufacturing capacity to support our growth in North America. We have also increased our sales coverage in Europe and Asia. Our acquisitions of Affaba & Ferrari in 2020, and Plastic Srl and Taplast in 2019, provide us with additional sales, design and manufacturing capacity in Europe, with additional manufacturing facilities in Italy and Slovakia. In addition, we are starting to expand into South America, opening our first warehouse in Brazil for planned commercial activity beginning in 2022. We believe TriMas Packaging's flexible footprint provides us with multiple alternatives for production to best meet customer requirements and helps mitigate the impacts of potential trade disruption. The majority of TriMas Packaging's manufacturing facilities around the world have advanced injection molding machines required to manufacture precision engineered dispensing and closure components, as well as automated, high-speed assembly equipment for multi-component products. 
Marketing, Customers and Distribution 
TriMas Packaging accesses its markets through direct sales to end-use customers, as well as through leading distributors, where it has enjoyed favorable, long-standing relationships. We employ commercial teams in North America, Europe and Asia, organized by product line and combined with a Global Strategic Accounts sales team, led by a chief commercial officer. We also at times use third-party agents and distributors in key geographic markets, including Europe, South America and Asia, as well as agents and distributors primarily to sell to container manufacturers and to users or fillers of containers. 
TriMas Packaging's end customers include, but are not limited to, consumer packaged goods, beauty and cosmetic, personal care, medical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, food and beverage, industrial, agricultural, chemical, and cleaning and sanitary supply companies. We also provide products into applications used by warehouse clubs, e-retailers and fast food retailers. We may provide products directly to the end customer, but the end customers may also specify that our products be provided to fillers or packagers. In addition, we also provide products to major container manufacturers, and maintain a customer service center that provides technical support, as well as other technical assistance to customers. 
TriMas Packaging has manufacturing and support facilities in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, China, India and Vietnam.
Competition 
TriMas Packaging has a broad range of products in closure, dispensing and flexible packaging systems, and therefore has various competitors in each of our product offerings. We do not believe that there is a single competitor that matches our entire product offering. Depending on the product and customers served, our competitors include Aptar, Bericap, Berry Global, Greif, Mold-Rite, Phoenix Closures, Silgan, Technocraft and other smaller private companies located in Asia.
Aerospace (22% of 2021 net sales)
Our Aerospace segment is comprised of TriMas Aerospace, which includes the Monogram Aerospace Fasteners, Allfast Fastening Systems, Mac Fasteners, RSA Engineered Products, Martinic Engineering and TFI Aerospace brands.

We believe our customer-focused approach to provide cost-effective technical solutions will drive the development of new products and create new opportunities for growth. 
•Leading Manufacturing Capabilities and Processes. We believe that TriMas Aerospace is a leading manufacturer of precision-engineered components for the aerospace industry. Given industry regulatory requirements, as well as customer requirements, these products are required to be manufactured within tight tolerances and specifications, often out of hard-to-work-with and exotic materials including titanium, Inconel and specialty steels. TriMas Aerospace is also capable of advanced precision computer numerical controlled ("CNC") milling, high performance CNC turning and assembly, working in a variety of metals including super alloys, stainless steel, aircraft steel alloys, carbon steel alloys and aluminum alloys. Many of TriMas Aerospace’s products, facilities and manufacturing processes are required to be qualified and/or certified. Key certifications in TriMas Aerospace include: AS9100:2009 Revision D; ISO9001:2008; TSO; and NADCAP for non-destructive testing, heat treatment, wet processes and materials testing. While proprietary products and patents are important, having proprietary manufacturing processes and capabilities makes TriMas Aerospace’s products difficult to replicate. The aerospace industry has strict requirements for quality and delivery, making process innovation and continuous improvement vital to TriMas Aerospace's success. We believe TriMas Aerospace’s manufacturing processes, capabilities and quality focus create a competitive strength for the business. 
Marketing, Customers and Distribution 
TriMas Aerospace serves both OEM and aftermarket customers on a wide variety of platforms. Given the focused nature of many of our products, TriMas Aerospace relies upon a global sales and technical team that is knowledgeable of both OEM customers and the established network of independent distributors. Although the markets for fasteners are highly competitive, we provide products and services primarily for specialized applications, and compete principally on technology, quality and service. TriMas Aerospace works directly with aircraft manufacturers to develop and test new products and improve existing products. TriMas Aerospace’s primary customers include OEMs, supply chain distributors, tier one suppliers and the United States government. 
TriMas Aerospace's manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada. In addition to TriMas Aerospace's facilities in California, we are also ramping up a new facility in Mesa, Arizona. Given the nature of the components TriMas Aerospace manufactures, it can ship products efficiently to Europe, South America and Asia. 
Competition 
Depending on the product and customers served, our primary competitors include Ateliers de la Haute Garonne, Cherry Aerospace - Precision Castparts Corp., Howmet Aerospace, LISI Aerospace and Senior Aerospace, as well as a variety of aerospace and general industrial machined component manufacturers. We believe that we are a leader in the blind bolt market with significant market share in all blind fastener product categories in which we compete. 
Specialty Products (16% of 2021 net sales)
Our Specialty Products segment is comprised of our Norris Cylinder and Arrow Engine Company businesses. We believe these businesses are well established and recognized in the end markets they serve. 
TriMas' Norris Cylinder business is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of highly-engineered steel cylinders for use in industrial, heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC"), construction, health care and defense end markets. We believe that Norris Cylinder is a leading provider of a complete line of large, intermediate and small size, high and low-pressure steel cylinders for the transportation, storage and dispensing of compressed gases. Norris Cylinder’s large high-pressure seamless gas cylinders are used principally for shipping, storing and dispensing oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium and other compressed gases. In addition, Norris Cylinder offers a complete line of steel cylinders used to contain and dispense acetylene gas for the welding and cutting industries. Norris Cylinder's products meet the rigorous standards required by the Department of Transportation ("DOT") or International Standards Organization ("ISO"), which certifies a cylinder's adequacy to perform in specific applications. 
Arrow Engine is a provider of natural gas powered wellhead engines, compressors and replacement parts, all engineered for use in oil and natural gas production and other industrial and commercial markets. As Arrow's engines can operate from the natural gas produced at the wellhead, we believe Arrow is uniquely positioned to provide its products for remote pump jack installations. Arrow Engine distributes its products through a worldwide distribution network, primarily focused in the United States and Canada. Arrow Engine manufactures its own engine line and also offers a wide variety of spare parts for various industrial engines not manufactured by Arrow Engine. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe our Specialty Products segment benefits from the following competitive strengths in coordination with operating under TriMas' overarching strategy: 
•Leading Market Positions and Strong Brand Names. With more than 70 years of experience, Norris Cylinder is one of the worlds' largest manufacturers of high- and low-pressure steel cylinders, and the only manufacturer in the United States. In 2021, Norris Cylinder became an official “Made in the USA” designated manufacturer, which we believe allows Norris to locally address customers' needs, while maintaining more control over lead times and quality. We believe that Norris has a reputation for high-quality cylinders used in a variety of applications, including industrial gas, welding and cutting, government, medical, laboratories, food and beverage technology, breathing air, fire protection and aviation. We believe that Arrow Engine also has also a leading market position in the niche it serves. 
•Comprehensive Product Offering. We believe that both Norris Cylinder and Arrow Engine offer a comprehensive product offering that meets their customers' needs. Norris Cylinder offers a complete line of large, intermediate and small size, high and low-pressure steel cylinders to its customers across a variety of end markets. Arrow Engine also provides a comprehensive product offering, including engines, compressors, chemical pumps, generator sets, electronics and replacement parts to a variety of oilfield and industrial markets. During 2021, utilizing the tools of Kaizen, Arrow Engine developed and launched a new reduced emission EPA-certified A54-E engine platform for stationary and off-road mobile applications.
•Established and Extensive Distribution Channels. Our Specialty Products businesses have long-standing customer relationships and distributes directly to major companies, as well as distributing to domestic buying groups, OEMs, medium and small independent companies, and independent distributors. Our long-standing supply positions in this well-established network has allowed our Specialty Products businesses to successfully navigate some of the most robust, as well as harshest, economic cycles.
•Difficult and Costly to Replicate Manufacturing Base. Our Norris Cylinder business has locations in Longview, Texas, and Huntsville, Alabama, which have numerous forging and metalworking pieces of equipment and processes. While there are other manufacturers of steel cylinders globally, the installation of manufacturing processes and adding new capacity tends to be a lengthy process and a costly investment to implement. As such, in periods of rising demand, as we have experienced in 2021, Norris Cylinder's installed capacity and manufacturing presence in the United States provides an advantage when compared to non-U.S. suppliers dealing with logistic constraints.
Marketing, Customers and Distribution 
The customers of our Specialty Products segment predominantly operate in the industrial end markets, and to a lesser extent, the upstream oil and gas end markets. Given the focused nature of many of our products, we rely upon a combination of a direct sales force and an established network of distributors with familiarity of the end-users. Norris Cylinder, for example, sells directly to customers and through distributors. Our primary customers include industrial gas producers and distributors, welding equipment distributors, and equipment manufacturers. 
The Norris Cylinder and Arrow Engine manufacturing facilities are located in the United States. 
Competition 
Norris Cylinder competes against Worthington, Beijing Tianhai Industry Co., Faber and Vitkovice Cylinders, but is the only steel cylinder manufacturer in the United States. In May 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a unanimous final determination that Norris Cylinder had been materially injured by imports of DOT high-pressure steel cylinders that were being subsidized by the Government of China, as well as being dumped in the U.S. market by producers in China. As a result, trade duties were imposed on the subject imports for a five-year period to create a fairer competitive environment in the United States. The duty was extended and increased for an additional five-year period in 2017. Arrow Engine tends to compete against natural gas powered, lower horsepower, multi-cylinder engines from manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Chevy, Cummins and Ford industrial engines and electric motors. 
TriMas' Acquisition Strategy
TriMas views the pursuit of strategic acquisitions as core to augmenting its growth and achieving its overarching corporate strategy. We believe TriMas is uniquely positioned to leverage its relatively low debt profile and its strong free cash flow profile to identify and complete bolt-on acquisitions annually as part of its capital allocation philosophy. TriMas’ acquisition priority is to build out our Packaging platform, continuing our initiative to increase TriMas’ weight in packaging-related end markets, which currently comprises nearly 65% of consolidated net sales, as well as explore unique opportunities to build out our Aerospace platform. We typically seek to acquire adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers and end markets, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. Since the beginning of 2019, TriMas has completed seven acquisitions and one divestiture.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
Our largest raw material purchases are for resins (such as polypropylene and polyethylene), steel, aluminum and other oil and metal-based purchased components. Raw materials and other supplies used in our operations are normally available from a variety of competing suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase a variety of components and finished products from sources in lower-cost countries.
Polypropylene and polyethylene are generally commodity resins with multiple suppliers capable of providing product globally. Steel is purchased primarily from steel mills and service centers. Changing global dynamics for steel production and supply will continue to present a challenge to our business. 
Historically, we have experienced volatility in costs and availability of our raw material purchases and have worked with our suppliers to manage costs and disruptions in supply. We also utilize pricing programs to pass increased steel, resin and other raw material costs to customers. Although we may experience delays in our ability to implement price increases, we have been generally able to recover such increased costs.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,500 people, of which approximately 52% were located outside the United States. We have one facility, located in Commerce, California where our hourly employees operate under a collective bargaining agreement, and which represents approximately 14% of our U.S. employees. We have four facilities outside of the United States where our employees are affiliated with state-controlled or trade unions, which covers approximately 47% of our non-U.S. employees. 
We believe employee relations throughout our organization are good and we are not aware of any present active union organizing activities at any of our facilities. We cannot predict the impact of any further unionization of our workplace. Our labor agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America at our TriMas Aerospace facility in Commerce, California expired in August 2021, at which time we entered into a new three-year collective bargaining agreement.
TriMas focuses on a number of human capital resources objectives in managing its business, including our commitment to health and safety, employee engagement, diversity, equity & inclusion, and talent development. These human capital resources objectives, taken together, may be material to understanding our business under certain circumstances. These objectives are reinforced by our Code of Conduct, our global policies, including our Global Human Rights Policy and our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Statement, and our commitment to sustainability as evidenced by our Sustainability Reports. 
Commitment to Safety
One of our primary objectives under the TBM is the health and safety of our employees and anyone who conducts business on our behalf. The commitment to safety starts at the top levels of our organization. We believe a safe and secure workplace is fundamental to our success. TriMas is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, and complying with applicable safety and health laws, regulations and internal requirements. We are also committed to engaging our employees to continually improve health and safety by acting upon opportunities to reduce risk and improve our safety and health performance, and offer training programs on a regular basis. TriMas maintains comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying hazards and eliminating risks that can lead to work-place injuries. 
Employee Engagement
At TriMas, a commitment to continuous improvement is one of our core values and imperative to our long-term success. We embrace the tools of Kaizen and work to foster a culture of employee engagement to drive performance improvements and operational excellence. We believe that employee feedback is important which is why, in 2021, we administered an employee engagement survey globally. We will continue to work on our engagement as a company, with managers actively facilitating engagement discussions with their teams and developing action plans to ensure progress and continuous improvement.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe we are at our best when we bring together unique perspectives, experiences and ideas, and actively build diverse teams and inclusive work environments across our global locations. We believe that tapping into our employees’ diverse backgrounds and experiences ensures we make better decisions and supports stronger operating performance. Our goal is to foster working environments that are fair, equitable and safe, where rights are respected and everyone can achieve their full potential. Our policies and practices strive to assure equal employment and advancement opportunities for all qualified people. We also work to maintain appropriate standards of conduct in the workplace and to be sensitive to the concerns of our diverse group of employees. We strive to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, gender, gender identity and expression, genetic information, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws.
Talent Development
We believe that a talented, engaged and dynamic workforce is vital to our success. We seek to hire, develop and retain individuals who embrace and thrive in our culture. Our culture is grounded in our values: Integrity, Customer-focused, Teamwork, Results-driven and Continuous Improvement. Our businesses strive to build robust talent pipelines through targeted recruitment initiatives across our global footprint. Our programs are intended to ensure seamless onboarding for our new employees. We identify and nurture talent through a culture that is designed to enable employees to succeed and grow into leadership positions. We believe that our diverse businesses and structure provide many opportunities for employees to follow their own path and advance their careers.
We support a culture of continuous development, and we provide employees with the opportunity to receive frequent performance feedback. On a regular basis throughout the year, employees have goal alignment, performance and career development discussions with their managers (via annual goal setting, mid-year and year-end performance and talent reviews). At these times, employees receive candid feedback on their performance against set objectives.

Seasonality
TriMas does not experience significant seasonal fluctuation, other than our fourth quarter, which has tended to be the lowest net sales quarter of the year given holiday shutdowns by certain of our customers and other customers deferring capital spending to the following year. 
Government Regulations
Environmental Matters
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require obtaining and complying with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities. 
Current environmental laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. However, we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition to environmental laws and regulations, our operations are governed by variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Trade Policies and Regulations
Free trade laws and regulations provide certain duties and tariffs on qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. In the past few years, we have experienced higher input costs as a direct result of tariffs imposed on certain raw materials and components imported from China. In certain cases, we have passed-through these incremental costs to the customer, while in some cases we have not changed pricing to retain or expand volume, and in other cases we continue to work to install capacity in facilities where there currently is no tariff. In addition, certain of our U.S. suppliers raised prices for components in response to an overall increase in demand for domestic sources. 
We believe that we are in material compliance with free trade laws and regulations. While there may be an impact to our financial condition as a result of changes in the amount of duties or tariffs levied on products we sell, we do not believe that costs to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Intangible Assets
Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, and technology, are recorded at approximately $196.7 million at December 31, 2021, net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of the identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques.
Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from five to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology.
Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our businesses designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks (see prior discussion by reportable segment). Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law.
Technology. We hold a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies within all three of our reportable segments. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from one to 30 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. For example, patent rights have a maximum limit of 20 years in the United States. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry.
International Operations
Approximately 25.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, and approximately 37.1% of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2021 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, in addition to our U.S. operations. In addition to the net sales derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, we also generated approximately $80.6 million of export sales from the United States.
