ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Valvoline Inc. is a leader in preventive maintenance delivering convenient and trusted automotive services in its retail stores throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The terms “Valvoline,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “management,” and “our” as used herein refer to Valvoline Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise. 
Established in 1866, Valvoline’s heritage spans over 15 decades, during which it has developed powerful recognition across multiple channels. Valvoline has consistently adapted to address changing technologies and customer needs and is well positioned to service evolving vehicle maintenance needs with Valvoline’s iconic products. The quick, easy and trusted name in preventive vehicle maintenance, Valvoline leads the industry with automotive service innovations that simplify customer’s lives and take the worry out of vehicle care. With average customer ratings that indicate high levels of service satisfaction, Valvoline has built the model for transparency and convenience in automotive maintenance. From the signature 15-minute, stay-in-your-car oil change to cabin air filters to battery replacements to tire rotations, the Company’s model offers maintenance solutions for all types of vehicles. The Company operates and franchises more than 1,700 service center locations through its Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM (“VIOC”) and Great Canadian Oil Change retail locations and supports over 250 locations through its Express Care platform.
Company background
Valvoline has a history of innovation spanning more than 155 years that began in 1866 when Dr. John Ellis founded Valvoline by discovering the lubricating properties of distilled crude oil and formulated the world's first petroleum-based lubricant. Valvoline was trademarked seven years later in 1873, making it the first trademarked motor oil brand in the U.S. Soon thereafter, as vehicle ownership rapidly grew, Valvoline became widely known in the automotive world through racing victories and as a recommended oil for the iconic Ford Model T, while expanding its product offerings and global reach through its innovative automotive maintenance and heavy-duty engine applications. 
Valvoline was acquired by Ashland (currently doing business as Ashland Inc., and together with its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries, referred to herein as “Ashland,”) in 1950 and continued accelerating through the development of all-climate and racing motor oils, in addition to notable automobile racing victories by some of the biggest legends of the sport. By the late 1980s, Valvoline began operating and franchising VIOC service center stores, expanding into consumer-focused automotive preventive maintenance and quick lube services. Valvoline maintained its focus on innovating for evolving vehicle technologies and the needs of customers through the late 1990s and early 2000s by introducing synthetic and high-mileage motor oils.
Valvoline was incorporated in May 2016 as a subsidiary of Ashland, followed by the transfer of the Valvoline business and certain other legacy Ashland assets and liabilities from Ashland to Valvoline. Valvoline completed its initial public offering of common stock in September 2016, and Ashland distributed its remaining interest in Valvoline in May 2017 (the “Distribution”). Today, Valvoline operates as an independent corporation that trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “VVV,” focused on delivering quick and convenient vehicle maintenance services to further accelerate its growth. 
Discontinued operations
On July 31, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to sell its former Global Products reportable segment to Aramco Overseas Company B.V. (“Aramco” or the “Buyer”) for a cash purchase price of $2.65 billion, subject to customary adjustments with respect to working capital and net indebtedness (the “Transaction”). The Transaction is subject to standard closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in early calendar year 2023. Global Products sells engine and automotive 
4


products in more than 140 countries and territories to retailers, installers, and commercial customers to service light- and heavy-duty vehicles and equipment. 
The assets and liabilities associated with the Global Products business have been classified as held for sale, and its financial results are classified as discontinued operations and reported separately for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, the description of business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates solely to the continuing operations, comprised of the former Retail Services reportable segment. With the reclassification of Global Products to discontinued operations, Valvoline now has one reportable segment, which is reflected herein in the consolidated financial statements.

Industry overview
Demand for automotive aftermarket services benefits from the growing number and age of vehicles in operation as well as increasing vehicle complexity and ongoing improvements in miles driven. In addition, the North American automotive aftermarket services market is highly fragmented, which creates a significant opportunity for consolidation. Based on industry surveys and management estimates, the U.S. Do It For Me (“DIFM”) oil change addressable market depicted below demonstrates the magnitude of the opportunity for Valvoline’s retail services: 
Business and growth strategies
Continuing Valvoline’s shift to services as a trusted leader in preventive automotive maintenance, the Company will continue growing through ongoing improvements in service to drive same store sales and investments in network expansion, while continuing to develop capabilities for an evolving car parc. Valvoline’s strategic initiatives include:
•Continuing to capture increased market share and drive non-oil change revenue growth in existing stores by building on Valvoline’s strong foundation in technology and data, which enables the Company to be an industry leader in automobile aftermarket services and makes vehicle care easy for customers;
•Aggressively growing the retail footprint with company-operated store growth and an increased emphasis on franchisee unit growth; 
•Developing capabilities to capture new customers through services expansion focused on fleet manager needs and needs of the evolving car parc; and 
•Executing the sale of Global Products to create value for the Company's shareholders and best position the continuing operations for long-term success.

Retail store development
Valvoline’s network of retail service centers delivered its 16th consecutive year of system-wide same-store sales growth in fiscal 2022, demonstrating the system's operational excellence. As shown below, Valvoline operates, either directly or through its franchisees, 1,715 service center stores across the U.S. and Canada as of September 30, 2022:
 
l | Company-operated
l | Franchised 

Valvoline's three-pronged approach to increase its retail network is to grow through 1) opportunistic acquisitions, 2) new store development, and 3) franchisee unit expansion. The network of retail service center stores grew by more than 50% over the last five years. During this period, Valvoline added 588 net new stores since the beginning of 2018 and expanded its service centers internationally into Canada. The unit growth of the retail services network of stores over the last five years, in addition to its annual same-store sales growth in each of those years, is summarized below:

Competition
The automobile aftermarket service industry is highly competitive and Valvoline faces competition across its service categories and subcategories. Competition is based on several key criteria, including brand recognition, product selection, quality of service, price, convenience, speed, location, and customer experience, in addition to the ability to deliver innovative services to meet evolving customer needs.
Valvoline’s retail stores compete for consumers and franchisees with other major franchised brands that offer a turn-key operations management system, such as Jiffy Lube, Grease Monkey, Take 5 Oil Change, Express Oil Change, and Mr. Lube in Canada. Valvoline also competes for Express Care operators and customers with national branded companies that offer a professional signage program with limited business model support, similar to Valvoline’s Express Care™ network. Automotive dealerships and service centers, as well as regional players that are not directly affiliated with a major brand, provide quick lube and other preventive maintenance services, that Valvoline competes for customers with.

Marketing and customer experience
Valvoline places a high priority on delivering an in-store customer experience that is quick, easy, and trusted. Marketing plays an important role in showing customers the differentiated experience that Valvoline offers as well as provides information on location, pricing and services. Marketing efforts are focused on both the acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers. Valvoline’s digital modeling marketing efforts are efficient and yield strong rates of return. A variety of marketing techniques are utilized by the Company to build awareness of, and create demand for its automotive preventive maintenance services. Valvoline markets through search and direct response channels and invests in advertising through social and digital media. 
Valvoline leverages its digital tools to obtain customer feedback across the retail network of stores, which is frequently measured and monitored to ensure that opportunities are quickly addressed to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. Valvoline also utilizes its digital infrastructure and technology to more efficiently interact with customers, driving customer engagement and retention, acquisition, and to ensure consistency of service. The Company's strengths in digital marketing and data analytics are leveraged to attract new customers and retain current ones, including tailored marketing campaigns directed to specific customers when their next service is estimated to be due.
Intellectual property
Valvoline owns the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered in the United States and other jurisdictions. Following the closing of the sale of Global Products, Valvoline will own the Valvoline brand for all retail services purposes globally, excluding China and certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa, while Global Products will own the Valvoline brand for all products uses globally. Valvoline’s continuing operations holds approximately 160 trademarks in more than 50 countries across the world, including the Valvoline and “V” brand logo trademarks. These trademarks have a perpetual life, are generally subject to renewal every ten years, and are among Valvoline's most protected and valuable assets. Valvoline will partner with Global Products to ensure that once the sale is completed, Valvoline's iconic brand is managed in a consistent and holistic manner. 
Valvoline trade names and service marks used in its business include ValvolineTM and Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM, among others. Valvoline is also party to arrangements that license its intellectual property to others in return for revenues. Valvoline owns approximately 500 domain names that are used to promote Valvoline services and provide information about the Company.
Product supply and price
The products used in Valvoline’s retail service delivery are sourced from Global Products. Valvoline will continue this arrangement following the sale of Global Products through a long-term supply agreement whereby Valvoline will purchase substantially all lubricant and certain ancillary products for its stores from Global Products (the “Supply Agreement”).
Valvoline believes its scale and large volumes purchased provide beneficial pricing which allows for the arrangement of product supply for its store operations on more favorable terms than could otherwise be achieved. This benefit enhances the value proposition to new and existing independent store operators as well as the profits of Valvoline’s company store operations. Valvoline’s arrangement of product supply for its independent operators provides recurring fees and margins that benefit ongoing results. As Valvoline continues to grow organically and through acquisition, the business is well-positioned to continue driving increased benefits to the overall system of retail stores.
Valvoline works diligently to adjust its pricing to react to changes in costs and to preserve its margins. The customer value proposition in Retail Services focuses on convenience and quality service which provides the ability to leverage pricing power to raise prices while maintaining customer loyalty. Pricing adjustments to products sold to Valvoline's independent operators are made pursuant to their contracts and are generally based on movements in published base oil indices.

Seasonality
Overall, seasonality may modestly impact Valvoline’s business. Geographic diversity typically limits weather effects to specific regions, though transaction volumes can moderate along with miles driven during the seasons, which generally trend with the length of daylight hours, weather conditions, and vacation timing. In addition, the periods of time leading into North American holidays can also drive increased miles driven and transaction volumes. 
Regulatory and environmental matters
Valvoline operates to maintain compliance with various federal, provincial, state, and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of its business, including those regarding employment and labor practices, workplace safety, building and zoning requirements, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products used in service, and the ownership, construction and operation of real property, among others. Valvoline maintains policies and procedures to control risks and monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require Valvoline to obtain and comply with permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke the Company’s permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines, sanctions and injunctions. The Company is also subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in locations in which Valvoline’s services are offered. Such regulations principally relate to the operation of its service centers, advertising and marketing of Valvoline’s services.
Valvoline stores lubricating and vehicle maintenance products and handles used automotive oils and filters. Accordingly, Valvoline is subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, and local environmental laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act. In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), as well as various state and local environmental protection agencies, regulate the handling and disposal of certain waste products and other materials. 
As a franchisor, Valvoline is subject to various state and provincial laws, and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates franchising activities in the U.S. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Certain jurisdictions require registration or specific disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales, or have laws that limit franchisor rights with regard to the termination, renewal or transfer or franchise agreements. 
Valvoline is subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and customer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including financial information (e.g., credit card numbers), social security numbers, and health information. The Company is also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices.
Human capital 
"It all starts with our people" is one of Valvoline's core values, and the Company endeavors to create an environment that promotes safety, fosters diversity, encourages creativity, and rewards performance. In order to recruit and retain the most qualified team members in the industry, Valvoline focuses on treating team members well by paying competitive wages, offering attractive benefit packages and providing robust training and development opportunities, in addition to providing a strong operational support infrastructure with opportunities for upward mobility. Valvoline is committed to actively creating an environment where each team member is empowered to learn, grow, and maximize their personal contribution. 
Valvoline’s retail network of stores is comprised of nearly 2,000 locations, including independent franchised and Express Care stores. Of these locations, Valvoline operates 790 retail service center stores throughout the U.S. and Canada and supports its store network through centralized teams. The table below provides the Company's approximate distribution of employees of its continuing operations, which includes its company-operated service center stores, central supporting teams, and excludes contract employees, as of September 30, 2022:
10



 | Number of employees
Technicians | 6,850 
Store management | 950 
Customer service | 200 
Total company-operated store employees | 8,000 
Area and regional operations | 400 
Total retail services operations | 8,400 
Headquarter and virtual corporate team members | 500 
Total employee headcount | 8,900 

Valvoline management surveys team members periodically throughout the year to gather real-time feedback from employees and focus on continuous improvement. In response to feedback gathered in its most recent employee engagement survey, a cross-functional team developed a series of interactive workshops aimed to assist employees in identifying and developing a plan to achieve career goals at Valvoline. The Company introduced a three-step process to career development planning, along with several resources designed to aid employees in assessing competencies and designing a development plan specific to their goals. In addition, the Company surveyed employees during the year to solicit feedback and address questions regarding the separation of the businesses and established an intranet page dedicated to communicating and establishing transparency throughout the separation process. Valvoline believes employee survey results are important to evaluate areas for improved communication and are meaningful to recruit and retain top talent, believing satisfied employees are more likely to have a positive impact in the workplace and deliver great customer service.
There are several ways in which Valvoline seeks to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent as summarized further below.
Talent acquisition
Valvoline fosters a workplace culture that attracts and retains top, diverse talent at every level. Valvoline's talent acquisition is based on qualifications and experiences of target employees, including "building block" traits and capabilities that support strong development early in an employee's career with the Company. Valvoline utilizes innovative technology and structured processes intended to attract qualified candidates, including engaging job descriptions designed to reach a larger audience, a quick and mobile-friendly application process, online chat features to proactively address applicant questions, and video storytelling that offers a view of Valvoline's culture through the lens of its own employees. These tools have been created to convey what makes Valvoline unique as an employer to better attract diverse and ideal candidates, and these strong branding and sourcing efforts allow Valvoline to select among the very best. 
The Company’s focus on aggressively growing the Retail Services system that included the addition of 121 net new system-wide stores in fiscal 2022, creates a critical need for talent to operate those stores. Valvoline utilizes its tools and processes to attract qualified candidates within its Retail Services system, including providing support to franchise sourcing efforts. Franchisees are able to take advantage of Valvoline's recruiting and marketing programs, in addition to sharing hiring experiences and best practices across the system to ensure company-operated and franchised locations attract and hire the best candidates to deliver consistent and superior service to Valvoline's customers. 
Valvoline is committed to delivering an original experience for its candidates and was named a 2022 Talent Board Candidate Experience ("CandE") Award Winner in North America for the fourth consecutive year. The CandE Awards recognize companies with the highest positive candidate ratings in Talent Board's comprehensive benchmark research.
Training and development
The opportunity to develop and advance, regardless of job role or location, is critical to the success of Valvoline, and a key component of Valvoline's talent development approach is to provide each team member with the necessary tools and training opportunities to develop within their area of subject matter knowledge. Across the 
11


organization, including within the VIOC system of company-operated and franchised service center stores, employees are provided voluntary and compulsory regulatory, safety, compliance, customer service, and product training opportunities, based on job role and function, delivered via virtual or in-person classes and e-learning. This includes management and leadership programs with approximately 20 hours of live training and development for its new managers. In addition, the structured early learning detailed training plan of SuperProTM, an internal management system for executing Valvoline's retail services, supported by a proprietary digital learning platform, provides new VIOC employees 270 hours of training that is generally completed within the first 60 days of employment leading to their first certification and another 225 hours of training in the next 140 days that leads to a promotion.
Valvoline provides an Introduction to Management program within its VIOC stores multiple times during the year where assistant managers who qualify as potential store managers meet for three days to interact with leadership team members and peers from other stores to learn about Valvoline's culture, share best practices, and receive management training to prepare them for career advancement. The combination of these efforts enable Valvoline to continue a promote-from-within strategy which has led to 100% of service center managers, area managers, and market manager promotions in the last year being earned by team members who started in hourly positions at VIOC. 
Valvoline also offers and has many partnerships to deliver quality development opportunities, including those with leading universities, research organizations and companies, in addition to opportunities for employees to attend seminars and training programs provided by industry trade and professional organizations. Valvoline provides tuition assistance for employees enrolled in higher education programs directed at improving their performance or helping them prepare for a future role within the Company. By engaging team members early, Valvoline provides them with the necessary tools to learn and acquire new skills which increases their value as an employee and, most importantly, affords them the opportunity to advance their careers.
Valvoline received 2022 BEST Award winner recognition from the Association for Talent Development. The BEST Award recognizes organizations that are Building talent, Enterprise-wide and Strategically driving a Talent development culture that delivers results.
Total rewards
Valvoline believes that happy and well-cared-for team members bring their best selves to work. The Company provides a wide variety of benefits to eligible full-time and part-time employees. These benefits help support Valvoline’s strategy to provide competitive programs, aligning to the changing business environment and meeting employee needs. This includes attraction, retention, inclusion, motivation, development, promotion, engagement, and well-being (mental, financial, and personal health). 
The Company’s benefits offered to its employees consist of defined contribution matching, tuition reimbursement, and paid time off, including holiday pay, paid family leave and other leave programs. Valvoline’s benefits also include progressive and affordable healthcare plans and life, disability, and accident insurance coverage. In addition, the Company provides a variety of physical, financial, and mental health resources to support taking care of the whole employee.
Health and safety
One of Valvoline's top priorities is protecting the health and safety of its team members, known as its "Vamily." Valvoline offers employer-sponsored health and wellness benefits to its full-time employees and their families. In addition, Valvoline strives to create workplaces and practices in all environments that team members work in to help foster a safe and secure environment for every employee and customer. Valvoline emphasizes that "safety is always our priority" through one of its core values.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the well-being of the Company’s team members has remained a priority. 
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Valvoline formed a COVID-19 Steering Team that has been leading and coordinating the Company's overall response. This team has continued to follow and communicate guidance provided by national and local public health authorities, as well as track all relevant state and local government guidelines, directives and regulations as a part of Valvoline’s continued response and focus on 
12


mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The Company continues to support employees through its expanded employee assistance, telehealth services and well-being plans, new remote work policy, and individual paid time off and family leave, including paid sick or pandemic leave for quarantined employees. 
Diversity and inclusion
The Company believes in an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to inspire innovative ideas and decisions. Valvoline is focused on (1) promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion that leverages the talents of all employees, (2) implementing practices that attract, recruit and retain diverse top talent, and (3) demonstrating an investment in diversity and inclusion through diverse supplier spend, depositing cash in federally-insured minority depository institutions ("MDIs") and through the Company's charitable giving. As part of the Company's commitment to deposit cash in MDIs, Valvoline has invested approximately $2.0 million of its cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 with MDIs and is actively working to identify additional MDIs to invest with on an ongoing basis.
Valvoline supports inclusive, employee-led networking groups that provide a forum to communicate and exchange ideas, build a network of relationships across the Company, and pursue personal and professional development, such as Valvoline Women’s International Network. The Company also actively sponsors events that promote diversity and utilizes its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, a working committee to help steer diversity and inclusion efforts across the business and its operations. 
Citizenship
Valvoline’s citizenship efforts support social and educational needs within the communities the Company serves. At various times throughout the year, Valvoline supports its employees in volunteering their time and talents to give back to their communities. Valvoline employees support the United Way, Red Cross, Children’s Miracle Network, Habitat for Humanity, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Building Homes for Heroes, and many more local and global institutions and organizations. 
Valvoline's Charitable Giving Program encourages its team members to support the communities in which they live and in which the Company operates, through hands-on service, focused generosity and the continuous pursuit of innovative and sustainable solutions. Yearly, a major focus of Valvoline’s charitable giving programs is the annual employee giving campaign where employees are encouraged to give monthly donations through payroll deduction to the charity of their choice. Valvoline’s matching program will match the donations given to the organizations that align with the Company’s giving pillars: (1) disadvantaged families and children, (2) education, (3) the environment, and/or (4) diversity and inclusion. Additionally, Valvoline’s Grant Program offers non-profits the opportunity to submit proposals once a year for specific needs within their organization. Valvoline’s Charitable Giving Committee awards the grants based on the Company’s giving pillars.
