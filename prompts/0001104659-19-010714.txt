Item 1.                     Business
General
 
Beneficial Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in August 2014 to be the successor to Beneficial Mutual Bancorp, Inc. (Beneficial Mutual Bancorp) upon completion of the second-step conversion of Beneficial Bank (the Bank) from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure. Beneficial Savings Bank MHC was the former mutual holding company for Beneficial Mutual Bancorp prior to completion of the second-step conversion. In conjunction with the second-step conversion, Beneficial Savings Bank MHC merged into Beneficial Mutual Bancorp (and ceased to exist), and Beneficial Mutual Bancorp merged into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity. The second-step conversion was completed on January 12, 2015, at which time the Company sold, for gross proceeds of $503.8 million, a total of 50,383,817 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, including 2,015,352 shares purchased by the Banks employee savings and stock ownership plan. As part of the second-step conversion, each of the existing 29,394,417 outstanding shares of Beneficial Mutual Bancorp common stock owned by persons other than Beneficial Savings Bank MHC was converted into 1.0999 of a share of Company common stock. Upon the completion of the second-step conversion, the Bank changed its legal name from Beneficial Mutual Savings Bank to Beneficial Bank.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank, and the Banks subsidiaries. The Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Bank. The Bank offers a variety of consumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations through 61 offices throughout the Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey area. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). The Company is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to the applicable legal limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC.
 
Beneficial Bancorps business activities are the ownership of Beneficial Banks capital stock. Beneficial Bancorp does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of Beneficial Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report, including the consolidated financial statements and related financial data, relates primarily to Beneficial Bank.
 
Beneficial Bank was founded in 1853. Since we were founded, we have served the financial needs of our depositors and the local community as a community-minded, customer service-focused institution. We offer traditional financial services to consumers and businesses in our market areas. We attract deposits from the general public and use those funds to originate a variety of loans, including commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, equipment financing and leasing, one- to four-family real estate loans, consumer loans, home equity loans and construction loans.
 
Pending Merger with WSFS Financial Corporation
 
On August 8, 2018, WSFS Financial Corporation (WSFS) and the Company issued a joint press release announcing that WSFS and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into WSFS, with WSFS as the surviving entity (the Merger).  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors and stockholders of both companies, stockholders of Beneficial will receive 0.3013 shares of WSFS common stock and $2.93 in cash for each share of Beneficial common stock.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2019.
Acquisition History
 
In 2007, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, Beneficial Mutual Bancorp acquired FMS Financial Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farmers & Mechanics Bank. The acquisition of FMS Financial Corporation and Farmers & Mechanics Bank, which had 31 branch offices in Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties in New Jersey, substantially enhanced our market share and solidified Beneficial Banks position as the largest Philadelphia-based bank operating solely in the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area. In 2012, Beneficial Mutual Bancorp acquired SE Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, St. Edmonds Federal Savings Bank. The acquisition increased our market share in southeastern Pennsylvania, specifically in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties. Additionally, the acquisition provided Beneficial Bank with new branches in Roxborough, Pennsylvania and Deptford, New Jersey.
 
On April 14, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Conestoga Bank.  Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated October 21, 2015, between the Company, Conestoga Bancorp, Inc. (Conestoga) and Conestoga Bank, the Company acquired Conestogas ownership interest in Conestoga Bank for a cash payment of $105.0 million and subsequently merged Conestoga Bank with and into Beneficial Bank. The results of Conestoga Banks operations are included in the Companys unaudited condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the period beginning on April 15, 2016, the date of the acquisition, through December 31, 2018.  The acquisition of Conestoga Bank increased the Companys market share in southeastern Pennsylvania and provided Beneficial Bank with new branches in Blue Bell, Chester Springs, Feasterville, Media, Wayne and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In 2017, the Company formed Neumann Finance Company (Neumann), a majority owned subsidiary equipment leasing company, named after the Banks pioneering founder, Saint John Neumann. Neumann is focused on providing financing products and services to businesses nationwide and targets various equipment categories including technology, software, office, medical and other areas.
 
Market Area
 
We are headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We currently operate 38 full-service banking offices in Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania and 23 full-service banking offices in Burlington, Gloucester, and Camden Counties, New Jersey. We operate two lending offices in Montgomery and Delaware Counties, Pennsylvania.  We also operate one leasing office in Chester County, Pennsylvania. We regularly evaluate our network of banking offices to optimize the penetration in our market area. We will occasionally open or consolidate banking offices.
 
Philadelphia is the eighth largest metropolitan region in the United States and home to 66 colleges and universities. Traditionally, the economy of the Philadelphia metropolitan area was driven by the manufacturing and distribution sectors. However, the region has evolved into a more diverse economy geared toward information and service-based businesses. Currently, the leading employment sectors in the region are (1) educational and health services; (2) transportation, trade and utilities services; (3) professional and business services; and (4) due to the regions numerous historic attractions, leisure and hospitality services. The regions leading employers include Jefferson Health System, the University of Pennsylvania Health System, Merck & Company, Inc. and Comcast Corporation. The Philadelphia metropolitan area has also evolved into one of the major corporate centers in the United States due to its geographic location, access to transportation, significant number of educational facilities to supply technical talent and available land for corporate and industrial development. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is currently home to 14 Fortune 500 companies, including AmerisourceBergen, Comcast, PPL, DuPont, Aramark and Lincoln National.
 
According to a 2017 census estimate, the population of our eight-county primary retail market area totaled approximately 5.4 million. Overall, the eight counties that comprise our primary retail market area provide attractive long-term growth potential by demonstrating relatively strong household income and wealth growth trends relative to national and state-wide projections. The unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, for the Philadelphia metropolitan area totaled 4.1% in December 2018, which was higher than the national unemployment rate of 3.9% in December 2018.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many banks, thrift institutions and credit unions operating in our market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities.
 
Our competition for loans comes primarily from the competitors referenced above and other regional and local community banks, thrifts and credit unions and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies participating in the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies. We have also seen an increasing number of FINTECH companies that are focused on consumer and small business lending that are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks.  These companies have introduced a number of technology solutions threatening to disrupt traditional lending channels.
 
We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future.
 
Lending Activities
 
We offer a variety of loans and leases including commercial, residential and consumer loan products. Our commercial loan and lease portfolio includes business loans, small business leases, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans. Our residential loan portfolio includes one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our consumer loan portfolio primarily includes home equity loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, personal, and educational loans.
 
We intend to continue to emphasize commercial and small business lending and remain focused on commercial real estate lending. We will continue to proactively monitor and manage existing credit relationships. We continue to invest in our credit risk management and lending staff and processes to position Beneficial Bank for future growth. Specifically, we have hired additional lenders with significant experience in our market area to expand our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending efforts.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans totaled $1.54 billion, or 39.6% of our total loan and lease portfolio. This portfolio is comprised of loans for the acquisition (purchase), financing and/or refinancing of commercial real estate and the financing of income-producing real estate. Income-producing real estate includes real estate held for lease to third parties and nonresidential real estate. These loans are generally non-owner-occupied properties in which 50% or more of the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income from unaffiliated third parties. The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans to finance

office buildings, apartment buildings, shopping centers, hotels, motels, dormitories, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, mini-storage warehouse facilities and similar non-owner-occupied properties.
 
We offer both fixed and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. We originate a variety of commercial real estate loans generally for terms of up to 10 years and with payments generally based on an amortization schedule of up to 25 years. Our fixed rate loans are typically based on either the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburghs borrowing rate or U.S. Treasury rate and generally most are fixed with a rate reset after a five-year period.
 
When making commercial real estate loans, we consider the financial statements and tax returns of the borrower, the borrowers payment history of its debt, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the real estate, leases for any of the tenants located at the collateral property and the value of the collateral.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our largest commercial real estate loan was a $67.2 million loan for an upscale hotel in Avalon, New Jersey. The loan is well collateralized and was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2018.
 
Commercial Business Loans. At December 31, 2018, commercial business loans totaled $615.2 million, or 15.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
 
This portfolio is comprised of loans to individuals, sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and other business enterprises, whether secured or unsecured, single-payment or installment, for commercial, industrial and professional purposes as well as owner-occupied real estate loans. Owner-occupied real estate loans are loans where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow generated by the occupying business. Proceeds from these loans may finance the acquisition or construction of business premises or may be used for other business purposes such as working capital. In many cases, the owner of the occupying business owns the building in a separate entity and leases it to the business. In an owner-occupied property, more than 50% of the primary source of repayment is derived from the affiliated entity. Properties such as hospitals, golf courses, recreational facilities, and car washes are considered owner-occupied unless leased to an unaffiliated party.
 
We offer lines of credit, intermediate term loans and long-term loans primarily to assist businesses in achieving their growth objectives and/or working or long-term capital needs. The interest rates for these loans are typically based on LIBOR, bank prime, U.S. Treasury or Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh borrowing rate. These loans are usually secured by business assets, including but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. Many of these loans include the personal guarantees of the owners or business owners.
 
When making commercial business loans, we review financial information of the borrowers and guarantors. We apply a due diligence process that includes a review of the borrowers and/or guarantors payment history, an understanding of the business and its industry, an assessment of the management capabilities, an analysis of the financial capacity, financial condition and cash flows of the borrower, an assessment of the collateral and when applicable a review of the guarantors financial capacity and condition.
 
Commercial business loans include shared national credits, which are participations in loans or loan commitments of at least $20.0 million that are shared by three or more banks. Effective January 1, 2018, the federal banking agencies have changed the aggregate loan commitment threshold for inclusion in the shared national credit program from $20 million to $100 million.  Included in our shared national credit portfolio are purchased participations and assignments in leveraged lending transactions. Leveraged lending transactions are generally used to support a merger- or acquisition-related transaction, to back a recapitalization of a companys balance sheet or to refinance debt. When considering a participation in the leveraged lending market, we will participate only in first lien senior secured term loans that are highly rated (investment grade) by the rating agencies and that trade in active secondary markets. Even though we intend to hold these loans in our portfolio, we actively monitor the secondary market for these types of loans to ensure that we maintain flexibility to sell such loans in the event of deteriorating credit quality. To further minimize risk, based on our current capital levels and loan portfolio, we have limited the total amount of leveraged loans to $150.0 million with no single obligor exceeding $15.0 million while maintaining single industry concentrations below 30%. We may reevaluate these limits in future periods.
 
Shared national credit loans are typically variable rate with terms ranging from one to seven years. At December 31, 2018, shared national credits totaled $139.5 million, which included $83.4 million of leveraged lending transactions. All of these loans were classified as pass rated as of December 31, 2018 as all payments are current and the loans are performing in accordance with their contractual terms.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial business loan was a $19.8 million term loan to a telecommunications provider located in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2018.
 
Commercial Small Business Leases. At December 31, 2018, commercial small business leases totaled $139.9 million, or 3.6% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
 
This portfolio is comprised of small business finance leases. Primary production has been focused on equipment for medical and veterinary businesses with smaller ticket leases with shorter terms.  The average small business lease amount and lease term was $21 thousand and 4.7 years as of December 31, 2018.

When making commercial small business leases, we review financial information of the borrowers and guarantors. We apply a due diligence process that includes a review of the borrowers and/or guarantors payment history, an understanding of the business and its industry, an assessment of the management capabilities, an analysis of the financial capacity, financial condition and cash flows of the borrower, an assessment of the collateral and when applicable a review of the guarantors financial capacity and condition.
 
Construction Loans. At December 31, 2018, commercial construction loans totaled $188.5 million, or 4.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
 
We offer commercial and residential construction loans to commercial real estate and residential construction developers in our market area. We offer loans secured by real estate, with original maturities of 60 months or less, made to finance land development costs incurred before erecting new structures (i.e., the process of improving land including laying sewers, water pipes, etc.) or the on-site construction of industrial, commercial, residential, or farm buildings. Commercial construction loans include loans secured by real estate which are used to acquire and improve developed and undeveloped property as well as used to alter or demolish existing structures to allow for new development.
 
We generally limit the number of model homes and homes built on speculation, and scheduled draws against executed agreements of sales as conditions of the commercial construction loans.
 
Commercial real estate and residential construction loans are typically based upon the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal and/or LIBOR. Commercial real estate loans for developed real estate and for real estate acquisition and development are originated generally with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%, while loans for the acquisition of land are originated with a maximum loan to value ratio of 65%.
 
When making commercial and residential construction loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, the borrowers payment history, the projected cash flows from the proposed real estate collateral, and the value of the collateral. In general, our real estate construction loans are guaranteed by the borrowers. We consider the financial statements and tax returns of the guarantors, along with the guarantors payment history, when underwriting a commercial construction loan.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial construction loan was a $22.4 million participation loan for the construction of a luxury apartment complex located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The loan is well collateralized and was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2018.
 
One- to Four-Family Residential Loans. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential loans totaled $968.9 million, or 24.9% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
 
We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. We offer fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. Approximately 95.4% of our outstanding residential mortgage loans were fixed rate loans at December 31, 2018. We also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans with interest rates and payments that adjust annually after an initial fixed period of one, three or five years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the U.S. Treasury Security Index or LIBOR. Our adjustable-rate single-family residential real estate loans generally have a cap of 2% on any increase or decrease in the interest rate at any adjustment date, and a maximum adjustment limit of 5% on any such increase or decrease over the life of the loan. Our adjustable-rate loans require that any payment adjustment resulting from a change in the interest rate be sufficient to result in full amortization of the loan by the end of the loan term and, thus, do not permit any of the increased payment to be added to the principal amount of the loan, creating negative amortization.
 
Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. At December 31, 2018, floating or adjustable rate mortgage loans totaled approximately $44.3 million and fixed rate mortgage loans totaled approximately $924.6 million. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.
 
While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. We do not offer loans with negative amortization or interest-only loans.
 
It is our general policy not to make high loan-to-value loans (defined as loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or more) without private mortgage insurance. However, we do offer loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 100% under a special low-income loan program, which consisted of $15.6 million in loans as of December 31, 2018. The maximum loan-to-value ratio we generally permit is 95% with private mortgage insurance, although occasionally we do originate loans with loan-to-value ratios as high as 97% under special loan programs, including our first-time home owner loan program.  The balance of one- to four-family residential loans with an original loan-to-value equal to 97% or more was $8.0 million as of December 31, 2018.  We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by an independent appraiser approved by our board of directors. We require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone.

Home Equity Loans and Equity Lines of Credit. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans and equity lines of credit totaled $201.5 million, or 5.2% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
 
We offer consumer home equity loans and equity lines of credit that are secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, where Beneficial Bank may be in a first or second lien position. We generally offer home equity loans and lines of credit with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 80%. We require flood insurance on all home equity loans and equity lines of credit.  Home equity loans have fixed-rates of interest and are originated with terms of generally up to 15 years with some exceptions up to 20 years. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates and are based upon the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal. Home equity lines of credit can have repayment schedules of both principal and interest or interest only paid monthly. We hold a first mortgage position on approximately 60.0% of the homes that secured our home equity loans and lines of credit at December 31, 2018. 
 
The procedures for underwriting consumer home equity and equity lines of credit include an assessment of the applicants payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicants creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount.
 
Consumer Personal Loans. At December 31, 2018, consumer personal loans totaled $13.5 million, or 0.3% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
 
We offer a variety of consumer personal loans, including loans for recreational vehicles, unsecured personal loans and lines of credit. Our consumer loans secured by passbook accounts and certificates of deposit held at Beneficial Bank are based upon the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal with terms up to four years. We will offer such loans up to 100% of the principal balance of the certificate of deposit or balance in the passbook account. We also offer unsecured loans and lines of credit with terms up to five years. Our unsecured loans and lines of credit bear a substantially higher interest rate than our secured loans and lines of credit. For more information on our loan commitments, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity Risk.
Consumer Education Loans. At December 31, 2018, consumer education loans totaled $131.0 million, or 3.4% of our total loan and lease portfolio. Our consumer education loans are unsecured but are generally 98% government guaranteed. These loans are serviced by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency and Navient (formerly Sallie Mae). Our consumer education loan portfolio was previously purchased. We do not except to purchase or originate more of these types of loans. Thus, we expect this portfolio to decrease as these loans continue to be paid down.
Automobile Loans. At December 31, 2018, automobile loans that we originated totaled $94.5 million, or 2.4% of our total loan and lease portfolio. These loans are secured by new and used automobiles. The majority of the loans in this portfolio are indirect automobile loans. These loans have fixed interest rates and generally have terms up to 84 months. These loans have loan-to-value ratios of up to 120% of the purchase price of the vehicle depending upon the credit history of the borrower and other factors. During 2017, we discontinued offering indirect auto loans as other lending channels provided higher levels of profitability and returns on capital.
Credit Risks.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrowers creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the property that secures the loan. Additional considerations include: location, market and geographic concentrations, loan to value ratio, strength of guarantors and quality of tenants. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans and rent rolls where applicable. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower, when applicable, and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrowers expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.2x and a loan to value no greater than 75%. An environmental report is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials.
Commercial Business Loans. Unlike commercial real estate loans, which generally are made on the basis of the cash flow of the property that secures the loan, and are secured by real property, the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrowers business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. Our commercial business loans also include owner-occupied commercial real estate where the cash flow supporting the loan is derived from the owners underlying business.
Commercial Small Business Leases. Commercial small business leases are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrowers business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial small business leases may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such leases may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.  However, these leases tend to be significantly smaller than commercial real estate and commercial business loans with shorter average terms.

Construction Loans. Loans made to facilitate construction are primarily short-term loans used to finance the construction of an owner-occupied residence or income producing assets. Generally, upon stabilization or upon completion and issuance of a certificate of occupancy, these loans convert to permanent loans with long-term amortization. Payments during construction consist of an interest-only period funded generally by borrower equity. As these loans represent higher risk, each project is monitored for progress throughout the life of the loan, and loan funding occurs through borrower draw requests. These requests are compared to agreed-upon project milestones and progress is verified by independent inspectors engaged by us.
 
Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the dwelling. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment.
 
Residential Real Estate Loans. Loans made for the purchase of one- to four- family residential loans generally are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income and are secured by real property with ascertainable fair values.  Because these loans tend to carry a fixed interest rate and have terms as long as 30 years, the Company can be adversely impacted if interest rates increase.  While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on such loans.
Consumer Home Equity and Equity Lines of Credit. Consumer home equity loans and equity lines of credit are loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, where we may be in a first or second lien position. In each instance, the value of the property is determined and the loan is made against identified equity in the market value of the property. When a residential mortgage is not present on the property, a first lien position is secured against the property. In cases where a mortgage is present on the property, a second lien position is established, subordinated to the mortgage. As these subordinated liens represent higher risk, loan collection becomes more influenced by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
Consumer and Automobile Loans. Unlike consumer home equity loans, these loans are either unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as boats or motor homes. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and, therefore, are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
 
Automobile loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, as they are secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
 
Consumer Education Loans. These consumer loans are unsecured but generally 98% government guaranteed. Consumer education loan collections depend on the efforts of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency and Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) and are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability. Therefore, these loans are likely to be adversely affected by various factors including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. As a result of the government guarantee, we will ultimately be unaffected materially by delinquencies in the portfolio.
Loan Originations and Purchases. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, advertising and referrals from customers and other business contacts, including attorneys, accountants and other professionals, and walk-in traffic.
 
We also purchase loans and enter into loan participations with other financial institutions to supplement our lending portfolio. There were no purchases of participations in loan portfolios originated by other financial institutions during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.  Loan participations totaled $563.0 million at December 31, 2018 and are primarily comprised of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. A portion of our participation loans are shared national credits, which are participations in loans or loan commitments of at least $20.0 million that are shared by three or more banks. Effective January 1, 2018, the federal banking agencies have changed the aggregate loan commitment threshold for inclusion in the shared national credit program from $20 million to $100 million.  As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the balance of Beneficial Banks outstanding purchased shared national credits was $139.5 million and $199.5 million, respectively. See Lending ActivitiesCommercial Business Loans. Loan participations

are subject to the same credit analysis and loan approvals as loans we originate. We are permitted to review all of the documentation relating to any loan in which we participate. However, for participation loans, we do not service the loan and, thus, are subject to the policies and practices of the lead lender with regard to monitoring delinquencies, pursuing collections and instituting foreclosure proceedings.
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by management and approved by the board of directors. Beneficial Banks board of trustees has granted loan approval authority to certain officers or groups of officers up to prescribed limits, based on an officers experience and tenure. Generally, all commercial loans greater than $10.0 million must be approved by the Senior Loan Committee, which is comprised of personnel from the Credit, Finance and Lending departments. Generally, all commercial loans greater than $50.0 million must be approved by the director loan committee of the Banks board of trustees, which is comprised of five non-employee trustees. In addition, leveraged lending transactions must be approved by the Senior Loan Committee and the director loan committee of the Banks board of trustees.
Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrowers related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15% of our stated capital and reserves. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $143.3 million. Beneficial Banks internal lending limits are lower than the levels permitted by regulation and at December 31, 2018, the total exposure with our largest lending relationship was $78.6 million, which is the total of the amount outstanding and committed for a group of three commercial real estate loans and one commercial construction loan. These loans were performing in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2018.
Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 60 days.
 
Delinquent Loans and Leases. We identify loans and leases that may need to be charged-off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans and leases, classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrowers inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as a shortfall in collateral value may result in a write down to managements estimate of net realizable value. The collateral or cash flow shortfall on all secured loans is charged-off when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or in the case of unsecured loans the entire balance is charged-off when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent. For more information on how Beneficial Bank addresses credit risk, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk Management.
 
Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits, borrowings and loan and investment repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan and investment repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions.
Deposit Accounts. Deposits are primarily attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as individual checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW, municipal and money market accounts), savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
 
Our three primary categories of deposit customers consist of retail or individual customers, businesses and municipalities. Our business banking and municipal deposit products include a commercial checking account and a checking account specifically designed for small businesses. Additionally, we offer cash management, including remote deposit, lockbox service and sweep accounts.
 
Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, the rates on borrowings, brokered deposits, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing bi-weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products.
 
Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS). Our participation in this program enables our customers to invest balances in excess of the FDIC deposit insurance limit into other banks within the CDARS network while maintaining their relationship with us. We work with our customers to obtain the most favorable rates and combine all accounts for convenience onto one statement.
Brokered Certificates of Deposit. We will use brokered certificates of deposit to extend the maturity of our deposits and limit interest rate risk in our deposit portfolio. We generally limit our use of brokered certificates of deposit to 10% or less of total deposits. At December 31, 2018, our brokered certificates of deposits totaled $210.2 million and represented approximately 5.0% of total deposits.
Borrowings. We have the ability to utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh to supplement our liquidity. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain mortgage loans and other assets, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. We also have the ability to utilize overnight repurchase agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, along with the Federal Reserve
 
7




Banks discount window and Federal Funds lines with correspondent banks to supplement our supply of investable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. To secure our borrowings, we generally pledge securities and/or loans. The types of securities pledged for borrowings include, but are not limited to, government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) notes and government agency mortgage-backed securities. The types of loans pledged for borrowings include, but are not limited to, one- to four-family real estate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, we had combined maximum borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia of $2.2 billion.
 
Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 720 full-time employees and 15 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 
General
 
The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank that is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (Department), as its primary regulator, and the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system and, with respect to deposit insurance, of the Deposit Insurance Fund managed by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the Department and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other savings institutions. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and/or the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test the Banks safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in the regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its operations.
 
Effective as of December 23, 2016, the Company elected to become a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  As a financial holding company, the Company may engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted, such as insurance underwriting and investment banking, and is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the
 
8




Federal Reserve Board.  Prior to December 23, 2016, the Company was a bank holding company that was subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.
 
Bank Regulation
 
Pennsylvania Savings Bank Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended, contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Pennsylvania Banking Code delegates extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. Specifically, under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the Department is given the authority to exercise such supervision over state-chartered savings banks as to afford the greatest safety to creditors, shareholders and depositors, ensure business safety and soundness, conserve assets, protect the public interest and maintain public confidence in such institutions.
 
The Pennsylvania Banking Code provides, among other powers, that state-chartered savings banks may engage in any activity permissible for a national banking association or federal savings association, subject to regulation by the Department (which shall not be more restrictive than the regulation imposed upon a national banking association or federal savings association, respectively). Before it engages in an activity allowable for a national banking association or federal savings association, a state-chartered savings bank must either obtain prior approval from the Department or provide at least 30 days prior written notice to the Department. The authority of the Bank under Pennsylvania law, however, may be constrained by federal law and regulation. See Investments and Activities below.
 
Capital Requirements.   Under FDIC regulations, federally insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (state non-member banks), such as the Bank, are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements.   In early July 2013, the FDIC approved revisions to its capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.
 
The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revised the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to Beneficial Bank are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.  In addition, the rules assign a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rules also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. However, instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15.0 billion or less. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities), subject to a two-year transition period.
 
The rules also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement started to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and were increased by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.
 
The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institutions capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our current capital levels exceed the required capital amounts to be considered well capitalized and we believe they also meet the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements, including the related capital conservation buffers, as required by the Basel III capital rules.
 
Restrictions on Dividends. The Companys ability to declare and pay dividends may depend in part on dividends received from the Bank. The Pennsylvania Banking Code regulates the distribution of dividends by savings banks and provides that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings and may be paid in cash or property other than its own shares. Dividends may
 
9




not be declared or paid unless shareholders equity is at least equal to contributed capital. The Company paid cash dividends on its common stock totaling $0.49 per share during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits a bank, such as the Bank, to acquire an institution by merger in a state other than Pennsylvania unless the other state has opted out of interstate banking and branching. Federal law, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, also authorizes de novo branching into another state if the host state allows banks chartered by that state to establish such branches within its borders. The Bank currently has 23 full-service locations in Burlington, Gloucester and Camden counties, New Jersey. At its interstate branches, the Bank may conduct any activity that is authorized under Pennsylvania law that is permissible either for a New Jersey savings bank (subject to applicable federal restrictions) or a New Jersey branch of an out-of-state national bank. The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may exercise certain regulatory authority over the Banks New Jersey branches.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes three categories of capital deficient institutions: undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
 
Under the current prompt corrective action capital guidelines, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (3) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. An institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of less than 4.5%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. An institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of less than 8%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%.  An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4%; (3) a total capital ratio of less than 6%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%.  An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met the conditions to be classified as a well capitalized institution.
 
Undercapitalized banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. No institution may make a capital distribution, including payment as a dividend, if it would be undercapitalized after the payment. A banks compliance with such plans is required to be guaranteed by its parent holding company in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institutions total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with regulatory capital requirements. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce assets and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions must comply with additional sanctions including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
 
Investments and Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered banks insured by the FDIC have generally been limited to activities as principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the FDIC permit exceptions to these limitations. For example, state chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise grandfathered state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under federal law. The Bank received grandfathering authority from the FDIC to invest in listed stocks and/or registered shares. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 capital, as specified by the FDICs regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Pennsylvania Banking Law, whichever is less. Such grandfathering authority may be terminated upon the FDICs determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk to the Bank or if the Bank converts its charter or undergoes a change in control. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in other state authorized activities or investments (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) that meet all applicable capital requirements if it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank held no marketable equity securities under such grandfathering authority.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits the Banks authority to lend to, and engage in certain other transactions with (collectively, covered transactions) its affiliates (e.g., any company that controls or is under common control with an institution). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances, that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank or financial holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Bank to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by the Bank to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, the Banks authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (insiders), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Banks capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There
 
10




is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executives are subject to further limitations based on the type of loan involved.
 
Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FDIC determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the FDIC may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Banks deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000.
 
Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institutions assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. In 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule that implemented changes to the deposit insurance assessment system mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, assessment base for payment of FDIC premiums was changed from a deposit level base to an asset level base consisting of average tangible assets less average tangible equity.
 
The FDIC may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next, except that no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the FDIC assessment.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and our results of operations. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
On June 30, 2016, the Deposit Insurance Funds designated reserve ratio rose to 1.17% from 1.13% on March 31, 2016.  FDIC regulations provided for three changes to deposit insurance assessments the quarter after the designated reserve ratio reaches or surpasses 1.15%.  As a result, effective July 1, 2016, (1) the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions declined based on final rules approve by the FDIC in February 2011 and April 2016; (2) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large banks) began to be assessed by the FDIC; and (3) a revised method to calculate risk-based assessment rates for established small banks became applicable pursuant to a final rule approved by the FDIC in April 2016. The surcharge on large banks, which equals 4.5 basis points of the institutions deposit insurance assessment base, was in effect for assessments billed after the designated reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and would continue until it reaches 1.35%.  On September 30, 2018, the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reached 1.36%.  As a result, Beneficial Bank was awarded an assessment credit for the portion of its assessment that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.  This credit will be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. At December 31, 2018, Beneficial Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh of $2.0 billion of which it had $515.0 million in outstanding advances. The balance remaining of $1.5 billion is our unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank at December 31, 2018. Beneficial Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. Beneficial Bank was in compliance with requirements for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh with an investment of $23.2 million at December 31, 2018.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, as implemented by FDIC regulations, a state non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act neither establishes specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor limits an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of an institution, to assess the institutions record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider such record when it evaluates applications made by such institution. The Community Reinvestment Act requires public disclosure of an institutions Community Reinvestment Act rating. The Banks latest Community Reinvestment Act rating received from the FDIC was outstanding.
 
11




Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering.  Federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker/dealer subsidiaries, to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to verify the identity of their customers. In addition, these provisions require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institutions anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation.  The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g. property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Other Regulations. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Banks operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:
 
·                  Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
 
·                  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
 
·                  Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
 
·                  Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
 
·                  Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
 
·                  Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
 
The operations of the Bank also are subject to the:
 
·                  Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
 
·                  Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which establishes the rights, liabilities and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic fund transfer (EFT) services and financial institutions that offer these services; its primary objective is the protection of individual consumers in their dealings with these services;

Holding Company Regulation
 
General.  As a financial holding company, the Company is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. As a result, prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank or financial holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, before any bank acquisition can be completed, prior approval may also be required to be obtained from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired.
 
A bank or financial holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing discount brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a savings and loan association.
 
The Company is also subject to the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy guidelines for bank and financial holding companies (on a consolidated basis) substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
 
A financial holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the companys consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank and financial holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank or financial holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Boards policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank or financial holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Boards policies also require that a bank or financial holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank or financial holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would have potential applicability if the Company ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
 
The Company and the Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company or the Bank.
 
The status of the Company as a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect control of a bank or financial holding company or savings association. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or institution, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control. Under the Change in Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete
 
13




notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a bank company.
 
Federal Securities Laws
 
The Companys common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act. As a result, the Company is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act.
Federal Income Taxation
 
General. We report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowered the federal corporate tax rate in 2018 to 21% from 35%.  Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recorded as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the law was enacted, even if the assets and liabilities related to items of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The Company re-measured its net deferred tax assets at the current 21% federal corporate tax rate and, as a result, the Company recorded $13.1 million of additional income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. The 2016 and 2017 tax years remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.  For 2018, the Companys maximum federal income tax rate was 21%.  The Companys maximum federal income tax rate will be 21% in 2018 and future periods.
 
Beneficial Bancorp and Beneficial Bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement. Because Beneficial Bancorp owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Beneficial Bank, Beneficial Bancorp and Beneficial Bank are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, of which group Beneficial Bancorp is the common parent corporation. As a result of this affiliation, Beneficial Bank may be included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with Beneficial Bancorp and, if a decision to file a consolidated tax return is made, the parties have agreed to compensate each other for their individual share of the consolidated tax liability and/or any tax benefits provided by them in the filing of the consolidated federal income tax return.
 
Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1987. Approximately $1.4 million of income tax related to our accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recognized unless Beneficial Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to Beneficial Bancorp as described below.
Distributions. If Beneficial Bank makes non-dividend distributions to Beneficial Bancorp, the distributions will be considered to have been made from Beneficial Banks un-recaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the non-dividend distributions, and then from Beneficial Banks supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in Beneficial Banks taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of Beneficial Banks current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of Beneficial Banks current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in Beneficial Banks taxable income.
 
The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if Beneficial Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to Beneficial Bancorp, approximately one and one-quarter times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate. Beneficial Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.
 
State, City and Local Taxation
 
Beneficial Bank is a savings bank conducting business in Pennsylvania (PA), New Jersey (NJ) and Philadelphia (PHL), and is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax (MTIT) Act, New Jerseys Corporation Business Tax, and the City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax. The MTIT is a tax upon separately stated net book income, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The MTIT tax rate is 11.5%. Net operating losses, if any, can be carried forward a maximum of three years for MTIT purposes. New Jerseys Corporation Business Tax is calculated based on separate company apportioned taxable income, where taxable income is determined based on federal taxable income, subject to certain state adjustments and modifications. The New Jersey corporate income tax rate is 9.0%. On July 1, 2018, New Jersey signed into law Assembly Bill 4202, which significantly revises New Jerseys Corporation Business Tax laws. Assembly Bill 4202 imposes a surtax on Corporation Business

Tax taxpayers of 2.5% for the tax years 2018 and 2019 and 1.5% for the tax years 2020 and 2021.  For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, combined unitary filing is required. Net operating losses may be carried forward for twenty years following the tax year for which they were first reported. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax is a tax upon net income (6.35%) or taxable gross receipts (.14%) imposed on persons carrying on or exercising for gain or profit certain business activities within Philadelphia. For regulated industry taxpayers, the tax is the lesser of the tax on net income or the tax on gross receipts.  The tax years 2015 through 2017 remain subject to examination by various state and local taxing authorities.
 
Beneficial Equipment Finance Corporation (BEFC) is a corporation that is in the business of leasing small equipment and fixed assets. As a result of its leasing transactions, BEFC files as a separate company in several state and local jurisdictions and Beneficial Bancorp and its affiliates file in several unitary jurisdictions. These state and local jurisdictions have net operating loss carry forward periods between three and twenty years. Additionally, Beneficial Bank has other subsidiaries that file in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. These jurisdictions allow for net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward for twenty years.
