Item 1. Business
 
As used herein, the term “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refers to Fresh Promise Foods, Inc., a Nevada corporation and subsidiaries unless otherwise noted.
 
Overview
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware under the name, PLR, Inc. in 1993. Later we completed several name changes and reorganizations.
 
In November 1997, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Integrated Carbonics Corp. We also changed our domicile to the State of Nevada. On July 23, 1999, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Urbana.ca, Inc. (“URBA”).
 
And on April 11, 2003, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to PSPP Holdings, Inc. and later on August 11, 2008 we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Cynosure Holdings, Inc.
 
On August 21, 2008, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Mod Hospitality, Inc. This was followed by a further amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on December 16, 2009 wherein we changed our name to Stakool, Inc.
 
On June 16, 2011, we entered into a Letter of Intent of Sale and Purchase with Anthus Life Corp., a privately held Nevada corporation (“Anthus”). Subsequently and on July 20, 2011, we and Anthus executed an Agreement of Sale and Purchase whereby Anthus stockholders received 77,588,470 shares of 79,388,470 shares of our then issued and outstanding common stock together with 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock in exchange for scheduled payments, totaling $350,000 and 1,300,000 shares of our common stock (the “Anthus Acquisition Agreement”).
 
Subsequently, the Stakool and Anthus Acquisition Agreement was amended effective January 19, 2012 to allow for the issuance of an additional 2,650,000 shares of our common stock to certain parties to acquire all of the then outstanding common stock of Anthus. As a result of the Anthus Acquisition Agreement, Anthus became our wholly owned subsidiary and all of the shares of our preferred stock and common stock were duly issued and the sum of $355,000 was duly paid in accordance with that agreement.
 
Anthus was incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2009. At the time of the closing of the Anthus Acquisition Agreement, Anthus was a developer and manufacturer of certain natural and organic food products packaged for consumer consumption. At the time, Anthus had one product line in the natural food category and others that it believed could be viable commercial products.

However, and in 2013 following our internal financial evaluations, we terminated the production of the Anthus products in light of our assessment of our ability to raise the additional capital needed to market and sell the Anthus products.
 
On March 15, 2013 all of our officers and directors resigned Mr. Joseph C. Canouse was appointed as our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director.
 
While we believe that our Anthus product line may offer good value to consumers, we have not undertaken any product or market research to confirm our assessment. Even if the Anthus product line has strong commercial value, unless or until we have sufficient additional financial and managerial resources needed to undertake the anticipated additional market research and the manufacturing, marketing, and promotional efforts that would be required to implement any re-commercialization of the Anthus products, we may not pursue any re-commercialization of the Anthus product line. In the event that we are successful in obtaining sufficient additional capital, we may, if market conditions are favorable, resume production of one or more of the Anthus products. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain the additional capital that will allow us to undertake these efforts or if we do obtain any additional capital, that it can be obtained on reasonable terms and in sufficient amounts that we will be able to implement any such efforts at any time in the future.
 
Effective August 5, 2013, we completed a 1 for 100 reverse stock split with the result that we reduced the number of our issued and outstanding common shares from 2,903,888,889 to approximately 29,039,066(the “First Reverse Stock Split”). Our consolidated financial statements reflect the First Reverse Stock Split.
 
On September 26, 2013, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Fresh Promise Foods, Inc. The amendment also reduced the number of authorized shares of our common stock from four billion (4,000,000,000) common shares to four hundred seventy-five million (475,000,000) common shares.
 
On May 13, 2014, we further amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of our common stock from four hundred seventy-five million (475,000,000) common shares to nine hundred seventy-five million (975,000,000) common shares.
 
On June 2, 2014, Joseph C. Canouse resigned as Chairman of our Board of Directors and as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and our Board of Directors appointed Scott Martin as a Director and Secretary and Mr. Kevin P. Quirk was appointed Chairman of the Board.
 
On October 16, 2014, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from nine hundred seventy-five million (975,000,000) common shares to two billion (2,000,000,000) common shares.
 
Effective January 20, 2015, we effected a 1-for-150 reverse split (the “Second Reverse Stock Split”) which as preceded by a filing of an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that we completed with the Nevada Secretary of State on December 30, 2014.
 
On January 6, 2016, we entered into that certain Director Resignation and Release Agreement with Kevin P. Quirk (the “Quirk Release Agreement”). In accordance with the Quirk Release Agreement, Mr. Quirk resigned from his positions as our Chief Executive Officer and Director in exchange for our release of Mr. Quirk from certain liabilities.  
 
On July 12, 2016, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the amount of our authorized common stock from billion (2,000,000,000) common shares to five billion (5,000,000,000) common shares.
 
On June 27, 2017, we and Creative Edge Nutrition, a Nevada corporation ("CEN") entered into that certain asset purchase agreement whereby we acquired certain assets and we assumed certain liabilities of CEN's subsidiary, Giddy Up Energy Products, Inc. ("Giddy"). As consideration, we also agreed to exchange 4,719,760,108 shares of its common stock. On January 24, 2018, we completed the distribution of its common shares to the CEN shareholders in order to consummate the acquisition of Giddy. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is in the process of spinning out its existing assets and liabilities and assuming Giddy's business plan involving nutritional supplements and energy drinks focusing on an active lifestyle.

On August 23, 2017, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from five billion (5,000,000,000) common shares to nine billion (9,000,000,000) common shares.
 
On October 13, 2017, we entered into that certain Director Resignation and Release Agreement with Scott C. Martin (the “Martin Release Agreement”). In accordance with the Martin Release Agreement, Mr. Martin resigned from his position as our Director in exchange for our release of Mr. Martin from certain liabilities.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
In light of our legal proceedings involving certain former management of the Company, we decided to discontinue our business operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with our December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In August 2018, we executed a definitive agreement to sell and transfer our equity interest in Harvest Soul.
 
Our results of operations related to Harvest Soul have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all years presented. Unless otherwise indicated, the following discussions in this section (Item 1. Business) pertain only to our continuing operations. For additional information see Note 3 — Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
 
Current Products, Potential Product Categories and Product Extensions
 
We are a consumer products company focused on the health and wellness food and beverage sectors. We also are a brand acquisition and holding company. We offer products that we believe can provide health and wellness solutions that make sense and fit into the everyday lives of certain consumer segments. While we have limited managerial and financial resources, we are focused on three strategic areas: Food Technology, Consumer Products and Value Added.
 
We believe that we are different than many of our competitors in that we may be able to combine innovative technology and product development with perceptive marketing and sales service strategy. Currently, we own and operate subsidiaries in green and energy drink markets. See: www.drinkgiddyup.com.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have no patented technology and we do not hold any patents that would otherwise serve to provide us with any protection of our intellectual property rights. However, our products are generally formulated utilizing our own proprietary formulations.
Production, Sources of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers
 
While our sole corporate officer, Joe E. Poe, Jr. and our consultants have reviewed, studied and analyzed the natural and/or organic product market in certain product areas, our strategy is to establish a product procurement and development program that may allow us to obtain the assistance of marketing professionals. In all of these efforts we may, if our financial circumstances and market conditions allow, offer us an opportunity to build our business, create brands through eco-friendly packaging and distinctive labeling, and develop potentially key product distribution relationships in selected geographic and certain markets that may offer us significant opportunities.
Marketing Strategy
 
If we can successfully implement our business strategy, we seek to have our brand name strongly associated on with high quality products that attract a strong consumer interest and to focus our efforts on finding and developing complimentary nutritional supplement products for North America consumer market and beyond.

GIDDY UP Energy Products is a wholesale manufacturer engaged in marketing and distribution of carbonated and non-carbonated energy drinks, shakes, energy bars, and related products. All of its manufacturing operations are conducted in accordance with GMP guidelines at GMP Certified and/or FDA registered facilities. The website at www.giddyupenergyproducts.com.
 
Overall and if we are able to obtain sufficient additional financial resources on a timely basis and if market conditions allow, we seek to become a leader in certain segments of the quality food and beverage business and, in so doing, set the standards of excellence for food manufacturers as well. We are aware that our products will need to meet very high consumer expectations and provide greater consumer value in an intensely competitive marketplace where other larger and well-established consumer package goods (CPG) manufacturers have far greater financial, managerial, and marketing resources than we have and which we may have in the future. We do not anticipate that competition in the CPG marketplace will decrease at any time in the future. And to the extent that we are able to implement our strategy and our product and marketing plans, there can be no guarantee that we will gain and later sustain any significant share of the market and do so while also generating profits and positive cash flow. There are many large national and international CPG companies that have nearly unlimited financial resources, marketing budgets, research staff, and other resources that are far beyond any that which we currently have and any that we likely will have in the future.
 
Our limited in-house product research has led us to believe that there may be a sufficiently large consumer segment that may be attracted to our products and the perceived health benefits, product value, and product taste of our products that may allow us to gain sufficient product distribution and a retail presence in certain geographic markets.
 
We believe that words like “natural,” “clean label,” “green,” “eco-friendly”, “organic”, “non-GMO” and “sustainability” are the new marketing buzzwords in today’s food and beverage industry. Products and ingredients bearing these tags have created strong consumer loyalty in certain consumer segments and among significant purchase influencers. We believe that products offered by the CPG industry that possess natural and naturally derived ingredients are growing at above-market growth rates and that they offer greater profit potential for food and beverage manufacturers. We also are aware that over the past two decades consumers have become more health conscious with the result that products that are marketed with these buzzwords and offer good value to the consumer at an attractive price point attract a loyal segment of the retail market with repeat consumer purchasing behavior. In that respect, we believe that many of these consumers also view such products as a heathier choice than similar products that do not possess these perceived better attributes. Some CPG marketers have also said that such products also promote the consumer perception that they offer healthiness-on-the-go and beverages thus the perceived consumer value proposition is higher compared to products in the same product category that do not offer these attributes. We have not undertaken any marketing or product research and we have not engaged the services of any independent and professional marketing research firm to assist us in evaluating or developing any of our assessments and we have no present plans to do so.
 
We believe that there is a sizable segment of the CPG consumer market that understands and appreciates the “health value” offered by certain products and that they are willing to pay a premium for CPG products that include health ingredients, which may promote general health and well- being by preventing certain diseases. This is sometimes referred to as the “health and wellness segment.” However, we believe that the industry also confronts certain challenges in coping with the demand of natural ingredients used in food and beverage applications, particularly, in terms of sustainability.
 
We also believe that this “health and wellness” CPG segment will likely continue to increase and that this segment also offers better profit margin potential as well. And we believe that consumers are increasingly aware of the incidence of lifestyle-based disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), obesity, osteoporosis and diabetes, among others. We believe that this general market awareness has served to further the sales growth and the market share of products that are perceived as natural alternatives since this consumer segment perceives health benefits that are not available from other CPG products that are not “natural” or “organic.” Other products contain what some in the CPG industry refer to as “synthetic ingredients” in that they are not “natural” or “organic.” We believe that this product differentiation has further cautioned consumers and it has allowed products that are marketed under the “natural” or “organic” moniker to have higher price points and higher margins. Consumers perceive natural ingredients as having a positive impact on general health, while synthetic ingredients have certain detrimental effects on health. As a result, food manufacturers have promptly responded to the situation by completely replacing or partially replacing synthetic ingredients with their natural counterparts.

We also believe that CPG products that are marketed as offering greater health and benefits products are expanding faster than the overall market in many CPG segments. Thus, those products are gaining market share. Overall, there are many large, well-established CPG companies that possess a greater and far more sophisticated understanding of consumer trends and they have significant consumer research capabilities that far exceeds our current capabilities and those that we likely will have in the future. We are also aware that eight out of ten of the fastest growing food and beverage categories are generally linked to consumer perceptions of health. In 2013, the market for Health & Nutrition foods at retail value is estimated at $720 billion with a CAGR of 7.4%. This constituted 24% of the total food market which had an average CAGR of 2.8%.
 
Segments
 
Consumer Product Group (CPG)
 
If we are successful in obtaining sufficient financial, managerial, and marketing resources on reasonable terms and on a timely basis and provided that market conditions are favorable, we believe that we may be able to implement our business plan in one or more CPG product segments. In that respect, we may build and in other cases buy certain companies that may offer us attractive acquisition opportunities in one or more CPG health and wellness food and beverage market segments. While it is difficult to know the extent of future market conditions and opportunities that may be available, we anticipate that suitable acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria share a number of common features:

● | A concept with substantial, identifiable consumer demand which can be effectively replicated in multiple markets; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A unique brand asset capability that differentiates the company from its competition; 
● | Attractive business model economics which address specific customer needs and demonstrate operational capabilities to achieve market leadership; 
● | Strong management in place with a proven ability to execute a clearly defined strategic business plan; 
● | A strong, focused and customer-oriented culture; 
● | Significant growth or growth potential and an expansion strategy that is consistent with the company’s performance history; 
● | A defensible and extendable position in a growing industry category. 

 
We have observed that beverage products marketed as “a natural energy drink, bursts with flavor and is packed with healthy essential benefits such as dietary fiber, anti-oxidants, minerals along with vitamin C, vitamin D, B12, B3 and B5 currently attract what appears to be a strong and loyal consumer following. Some of these products also reference a blend of cherries and pears and the marketing lines include a suggestion that the product is a crisp pick-me up to satisfy and quench thirst. Such product marketing obviously requires a sophisticated understanding of consumer needs and the current consumer trends in selected consumer segments.
 
Competition
 
We face many large and highly successful competitors who have a long history of success in marketing a large and diverse product line in the beverage industry and the health drink product market segment. These competitors compete in multiple geographic and product markets with the help of internal and external market CPG research that we will never likely possess at any time in the future. They are well-established, multi-million-dollar companies that possess a greater and far more sophisticated understanding of consumer trends and they have significant consumer research capabilities that far exceeds our current capabilities and those that we likely will have in the future. Each of these competitors also possess sophisticated marketing models, a deep reservoir of experienced distributors and greater market research capabilities than we will likely ever have. These advantages are augmented with far greater managerial and financial resources that are far beyond and likely will be far beyond anything that we will ever possess.
