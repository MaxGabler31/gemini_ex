Item 1. Business. 
Overview
We are an early-stage biotechnology company developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets to neurological disorders and hair loss. Our team includes a diverse scientific group with expertise in nucleic acid chemistry, drug development and neuroscience. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, we conduct our discovery and development efforts in-house with a dedicated 30,000 square foot facility, including rapid and automated high throughput nucleic acid synthesis and screening. 
In December 2021, we announced our commitment to a plan to wind down our immuno-oncology program for cavrotolimod (AST-008) and our XCUR-FXN preclinical program for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia. We have transformed our strategic plan, with new focus on realignment of our research and development resources to support (i) the development of our preclinical program targeting SCN9A for neuropathic pain, (ii) the continued advancement of our partnered programs with Ipsen Biopharm Limited, or Ipsen, to develop SNA-based treatments in neuroscience targeting Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome, (iii) our continued advancement of our partnered program with AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie, to develop SNA-based treatments for hair loss disorders, as well as (iv) the continued research and development of other undisclosed therapeutic product candidates. 
Our therapeutic discovery and development efforts are supported by our proprietary Spherical Nucleic Acid, or SNA, technology. SNAs are nanoscale constructs consisting of densely packed synthetic nucleic acid sequences that are radially arranged in three dimensions. We believe the design of our SNAs gives rise to distinct chemical and biological properties that may provide advantages over other nucleic acid therapeutics and enable therapeutic activity outside of the liver. Our platform for therapeutic nucleic acids has demonstrated potential high potency, broad uptake, and prolonged efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo neurological models. The basis of our discovery approach harnesses our expertise in oligonucleotide chemistry for use against validated targets where we can screen thousands of oligonucleotides efficiently and identify top candidates in the appropriate cell and live animal models. We are conducting preclinical studies for a non-opioid analgesic directed against SCN9A (Nav1.7); undisclosed targets in Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome as part of our collaboration with Ipsen; and undisclosed targets in hair loss disorders as part of our collaboration with AbbVie. 
The table below sets forth the current status of development of our SNA therapeutic candidates. 
Recent Developments
In December 2021, we implement a reduction in force where we eliminated approximately 50% of our existing workforce on a staggered basis through January 2022 as well as other cost-cutting measures.
Effective February 4, 2022, Matthias Schroff, Ph.D. was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board to succeed Brian Bock, our former Chief Executive Officer and director. We also announced the resignations of Andrew Sassine, Timothy Walbert and Bosun Hau from the Board.
COVID-19 Business Update
The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic continues to have unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments, and our focus remains on safeguarding employee health, while minimizing the negative effects on our business and continuing to advance research and development of our therapeutic candidates. For discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Strategy 
We intend to build a leading nucleic acid therapeutics company based on our expertise in oligonucleotide chemistry targeting ribonucleic acid that in part is utilized via our proprietary SNA technology. The key elements of our strategy are: 
•Advance preclinical development targeting SCN9A in pain to therapeutic candidate selection and IND-enabling studies. Chronic pain is a major burden on society, making it a leading cause of disability. Patients have few pharmacological treatment options for their pain and even fewer when addictive opioid analgesics are excluded. SCN9A is a validated target for the treatment of chronic pain and we believe that antisense oligonucleotides targeting SCN9A have potential to be a highly effective, well-tolerated, non-addictive pain relief treatment. The promise of antisense oligonucleotides is the selectivity to SCN9A and the knockdown of the Nav1.7 channel while sparing other critical sodium channels and thereby avoiding deleterious side effects, which has been a limiting safety challenge common with a small molecule approach. We are exploring the development of several potential SNA candidates that have shown promise in our preclinical studies a significant level of knockdown of the SCN9A transcript. Human genetic studies suggest that reduction of SCN9A expression by approximately 50% may provide therapeutically relevant pain relief. Additionally, intrathecally dosed SNAs demonstrate robust distribution across the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, or DRG, in animals, which may facilitate SCN9A knockdown in the pain-relevant cells. From these findings, we continue to pursue the development of several potential candidates with the aim of helping patients with chronic pain where quality of life is significantly impacted, and few long-term treatment options exist.
•Continue to advance our preclinical development programs with Ipsen in the central nervous system, or the CNS, and with AbbVie in dermatology. In July 2021 we signed a collaboration agreement with Ipsen to develop SNA-based treatments in neuroscience, targeting Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome. This partnership combines our differentiated SNA platform for hard-to-drug targets requiring deep brain penetration and persistence with Ipsen’s expertise in neuroscience and rare diseases. In November 2019, we signed a collaboration agreement with Allergan Pharmaceuticals International Limited, or Allergan, to develop SNA-based treatments for hair loss disorders. This collaboration is a combination of our knowledge of nucleic acid therapeutics and dermatology with Allergan’s expertise in medical aesthetics. In May, 2020, Allergan was acquired by AbbVie. Both the AbbVie and Ipsen agreements included upfront cash payments and multiple preclinical milestones with initial discovery and development work to be conducted by us. We continue preclinical advancement of these programs in close collaboration with our partners and anticipate achievement of potential pre-clinical milestones in 2023.
•Enter into additional partnerships to accelerate development and commercialization of our SNA therapeutic candidates. We believe our oligonucleotide chemistry expertise along with our know-how and capability for high throughput screening of oligonucleotides, and our proprietary SNA technology enable us to 
enter into license agreements or development partnerships with companies that have development or commercial expertise in CNS where it would be uneconomical or impractical for us to develop SNA therapeutics independently. Additionally, we are currently pursuing various strategic alternatives for maximizing stockholder value of cavrotolimod, including various out-licensing scenarios.
•Continue to expand our core capabilities in oligonucleotide chemistry, high throughput screening and automated analyses. We believe there continues to be opportunity in optimizing oligonucleotide chemistry to advance greater efficacy and safety with nucleic acid therapeutics. This along with our SNA technology can be applied to bring first-in-class or best-in-class medicines to patients. Our goal is to identify and advance to clinical development therapeutic candidates for multiple different genetically-defined disorders in parallel, either on our own or with strategic collaborators. We continue to invest in critical infrastructure and know-how to execute on this goal.
•Build, enhance and protect our proprietary SNA intellectual property. We believe the three-dimensional structure of our SNAs provides novel technological and commercial opportunities. We have licensed intellectual property, or IP, from Northwestern and have also filed patents independently to protect our IP. Our license from Northwestern University is for exclusive worldwide rights to the use of SNA technology for therapeutic applications. We will continue to protect our IP and innovations arising from our R&D efforts, and prudently in-license technologies where appropriate for protection of our therapeutic pipeline and the broader SNA technology.
Our Proprietary Technology: Spherical Nucleic Acids 
Our therapeutic discovery and development efforts are supported by our proprietary SNA technology. SNAs are nanoscale constructs consisting of densely packed synthetic nucleic acid molecules that are radially arranged in three dimensions. We refer to these synthetic nucleic acid molecules in our SNAs as oligonucleotides and the radial orientation of the oligonucleotides without lipid or polymer encapsulation as our “inside out” or “3-D” approach. Our SNAs, unlike many other nucleic acid therapeutics, do not require lipid or polymer encapsulation or complexation in order to be delivered. Encapsulation is the process of confining the nucleic acids inside the cavities of larger structures, typically liposomes, whereas complexation is the process of creating an assembly of nucleic acids bound together with other molecules, typically lipids or polymers. 
This arrangement of oligonucleotides allows our proprietary SNAs to enter cells through class A scavenger receptors. Class A scavenger receptors are commonly found on the surface of cells throughout the body, which we believe provides a ubiquitous mechanism of cellular entry for the local administration of our SNA therapeutic candidates. This mechanism of cellular entry is different from many other nucleic acid therapeutics that typically bind to receptors found only in the liver. 
The broad tissue penetration and biodistribution properties of SNAs potentially enable three distinct therapeutic approaches. SNAs may be designed to reduce target protein levels by reducing corresponding mRNA levels in cytoplasm. SNAs may also be designed to modulate splicing of pre-mRNA in the nucleus to enhance or alter the product of a target protein and mitigate a genetic defect. Finally, SNAs may be designed to potentially elicit an immune response such as an anti-tumor immune response by agonizing toll like receptors in the endosomes.
Examples of our proprietary SNA constructs
We believe the key advantages of our proprietary SNAs include:
•SNAs cross certain biological barriers to deliver nucleic acid therapeutics. Local delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics through biological barriers, such as the skin, has been a significant technical challenge. In a Phase 1 clinical trial of XCUR17 in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, 11 of the 21 patients treated with the highest strength of XCUR17 gel were observed to have a reduction in redness and improvement in healing as determined by blinded physician assessments. Further, in preclinical studies, we have demonstrated delivery and activity of our SNAs in the CNS, eye, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.
•SNAs potentially exhibit superior biodistribution properties compared to linear oligonucleotides. In the fall of 2018, we completed a biodistribution study in rats comparing nusinersen to nusinersen in SNA format. We found that more nusinersen in SNA format was retained in the rats’ brain and spinal cord compared to nusinersen retained in the rats’ brain and spinal cord at each of 24, 72 and 168 hours. We believe that we have the opportunity to enhance the therapeutic potential of oligonucleotides by incorporating them in our SNA platform. Our facilities can design thousands of oligonucleotides and SNAs, rapidly testing these candidates through automated high throughput screening to discover novel nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. 
•SNAs can potentially target multiple genes with a single therapeutic candidate. In a proof-of-concept study in collaboration with Dr. Amy Paller, one of our scientific advisors, we presented data demonstrating the application of our SNA technology for concurrently targeting two different genes in a single SNA compound. We believe we can concurrently apply up to three oligonucleotides on a single SNA compound. This feature will potentially allow us to identify novel therapeutic candidates to treat multiple variants of a given genetic disorder or multiple genetic targets for a single disorder with one therapeutic candidate. We believe multi-targeting might be particularly beneficial for complex genetic diseases with more than one underlying genetic driver.
•SNAs we have administered to date have been well-tolerated. There are three key elements to our safety strategy. First, by administering SNAs locally, we expect to minimize systemic exposure thereby decreasing safety risk. Second, because SNAs enter cells and tissues without lipid or polymer encapsulation or complexation, we believe we can avoid the toxicity risks associated with these delivery systems. Finally, due to the nuclease resistance attributable to the architecture of the SNA, we use fewer chemical modifications than are customarily used in the nucleic acid therapeutic development. In each of the Phase 1 clinical trials of AST-005 and XCUR17, we observed no drug associated adverse events when the SNA therapeutic candidate was applied topically to the skin of patients with mild to moderate psoriasis. As of February 23, 2022, 5 of the 44 patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 1b and Phase 2 stages of the clinical trial have experienced a treatment-related serious adverse event, or SAE, as determined by the clinical trial investigator. The treatment-related SAEs experienced by these five patients were flu-like symptoms (n=6), hypotension 
(n=2), and injection site reaction (n=2). None of the 20 patients dosed in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial with doses of cavrotolimod (AST-008) experienced a treatment-related SAE. In summary, as of February 23, 2022, in total, 5 of 58 patients treated with cavrotolimod (AST-008) have experienced a treatment-related SAE.
•SNAs can be administered locally into a number of different cell and tissue types. SNAs enter cells through class A scavenger receptors, which are present on the surface of many cell types. We believe that by accessing this mechanism, our SNAs could have therapeutic applications in organs beyond the liver, such as the brain, eye, and skin. In preclinical studies, we have observed more than 50 cell lines and primary cells have been shown to internalize SNAs. 
•SNAs may produce a powerful immune response that has applications for anti-infective and anti-tumoral responses. In our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, we observed that cavrotolimod (AST-008), when delivered subcutaneously, was shown to elicit high levels of certain cytokines as well as activate important effector cells of the immune system, including T cells and natural killer, or NK, cells which are the main drivers of an anti-tumor response. In preclinical studies, SNAs localized to endosomes and stimulated the immune system via toll-like receptors, or TLRs. We have also observed in our preclinical studies that SNAs can generate a cancer-specific adaptive immune response. In addition, in our preclinical studies in a variety of cancer models, SNAs, in combination with certain checkpoint inhibitors, exhibited a greater anti-tumor response and increased survival than did such checkpoint inhibitors alone. Moreover, we observed that cavrotolimod (AST-008), when administered as a monotherapy, exhibited anti-tumor activity in mouse cancer models.
•SNAs have shown greater resistance to nuclease degradation. Nucleases are proteins that degrade oligonucleotides. In preclinical studies, SNAs have been shown to have an increased nuclease resistance compared to linear oligonucleotides. We believe this is a result of our 3-D approach (as discussed further above), and as a consequence, we believe that smaller amounts of SNAs may be required to achieve therapeutic efficacy compared to linear oligonucleotides.
Our Therapeutic Development Programs
Neurology 
We are investigating the utility of our SNA technology for the treatment of neurological conditions in pain, Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome. Additionally, see below “Neurology–Proof-Of-Concept Work with Nusinersen” for more information on our initial studies and resulting data that indicate that the SNA platform may be well-suited for development of new therapeutics directed towards diseases of the central nervous system.
SCN9A, Our Lead Program Candidate for the Treatment of Chronic Pain 
•There are insufficient treatment options for patients. Most patients with chronic pain are forced to rely on opioid medications that are often poorly tolerated, can be highly addictive, and are prone to the development of tolerance. Broad use of opioid medications to treat both acute and chronic pain has helped fuel the ongoing and devastating opioid epidemic in the U.S. There is an unmet need for the development of new analgesic treatment options, particularly ones that are highly efficacious and can be given for many years without concern of tolerance or addiction.
•Antisense oligonucleotides have potential to be a highly effective, well-tolerated, non-addictive pain relief. Oligonucleotides are capable of modulating gene expression via multiple mechanisms, enabling therapeutic applications to previously undruggable targets. Currently, there are ten FDA approved and marketed antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, of which one, nusinersen, acts on the CNS to treat spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, in pediatric and adult patients, and we are aware of other potential product candidates being evaluated in clinical trials for various neurological disorders. We believe the success of nusinersen to treat SMA provides a proof-of-concept that targeting gene expression in various tissues within the CNS is possible, including for the treatment of chronic pain that we are pursuing with our development of our SCN9A preclinical therapeutic candidate.
•SCN9A is a validated target for the treatment of chronic pain. SCN9A is the gene encoding Nav1.7, a trans-membrane sodium channel that plays a critical role in pain signaling. Nav1.7 is highly expressed in 
DRG neurons, which mediate transmission of external pain signals to the brain. Nav1.7-targeting therapies could provide a novel, non-opioid treatment option for neuropathic pain conditions in which currently available therapies are largely ineffective. We are developing SNAs targeting SCN9A for the treatment of chronic pain. Our compounds are designed to decrease Nav1.7 protein expression via RNase H-mediated degradation of SCN9A mRNA. Nav1.7 is translated from SCN9A mRNA within the cell body of the DRG, a critical tissue in pain signaling. We are exploring the development of several potential SNA candidates that have shown promise in our preclinical studies a significant level of knockdown of the SCN9A transcript. These compounds are highly selective for SCN9A and do not affect other sodium channels, which has been a limiting safety challenge with a small molecule approach. Human genetic studies suggest that reduction of SCN9A expression by approximately 50% may provide therapeutically relevant pain relief. Additionally, intrathecally dosed SNAs demonstrate robust distribution across the spinal cord and DRGs in animals, which we believe suggests that our SCN9A compound may facilitate SCN9A knockdown in the pain-relevant cells. From these findings, we plan to continue preclinical development of a number of potential candidates in 2022, including undertaking in vivo testing. We anticipate from results from initial in vivo animal studies by year-end 2022 with goal of therapeutic candidate selection in the second half of 2023.

Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome 
In July 2021 we signed a collaboration agreement with Ipsen to develop SNA-based treatments in neuroscience, targeting Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome. This partnership combines our differentiated SNA platform for hard-to-drug targets requiring deep brain penetration and persistence with Ipsen’s expertise in neuroscience and rare diseases.
Other neurological indications
We have leveraged our oligonucleotide chemistry expertise and high throughput capabilities for development and screening of SNAs in discovery efforts across a broad range of indications and therapeutic targets. We aim to address indications with great unmet medical need and where we believe the attributes of our SNA technology would lead to therapeutic and commercial advantages. In order to select new therapeutic indications, we expect to analyze a variety of attributes including: (i) indications where there is a known genetic basis for the disorder, (ii) disorders where we can target multiple genes, (iii) the existence of a patient registry or a patient advocacy group that can work with us for easier trial enrollment, (iv) the competitive therapeutic landscape including disorders not easily addressable by small molecules or antibodies, (v) indications with no approved therapies, and (vi) indications amenable to localized therapeutic administration. While we previously initiated discovery efforts in Batten disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we have suspended further development of these programs as part of our strategic measures to reduce cash burn as we prioritize our pipeline focus. We may in the future explore collaborative opportunities that would allow us to continue development of these initial discovery efforts. 
Neurology–Proof-Of-Concept Work with Nusinersen
Despite delivery challenges, nucleic-acid based therapy has been successfully developed to treat a CNS disorder. Nusinersen, by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Inc., was approved by the FDA in late 2016 for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. SMA is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle wasting and loss of muscle function due to motor neuron dysfunction. SMA is characterized by reduced amount of survival of motor neuron 1, or SMN1, protein. The severity of the disease depends on the amount of a related protein, SMN2, where lesser quantities of SMN2 are correlated to more severe disease. SMN2 is similar to SMN1, but leads to production of truncated protein, which is normally rapidly degraded. 
Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to modulate splicing of SMN2 pre-mRNA in the nucleus to generate an alternative version of SMN2 mRNA that leads to production of a functional SMN protein. Nusinersen is designed to enhance the production of the full-length, more stable variant of SMN2, increasing the level of SMN2 protein, and thus improving motor function. In clinical trials, SMA patients treated with nusinersen achieved and sustained meaningful improvement in motor function and survival compared to untreated patients.
To evaluate the potential superiority of the SNA over linear oligonucleotides in directing the production of a more stable variant of the SMN2 protein, we compared the effects of nusinersen in linear format with nusinersen in SNA format in cells derived from SMA patients. The data showed that treatment with SNA format of nusinersen resulted in greater levels of the more stable variant of SMN2 mRNA compared with linear format. SNA format of nusinersen resulted in up to 45-fold increase in the more stable SMN2 mRNA variant versus controls, while a much smaller 2.5-fold increase was observed using nusinersen in the linear format. 
We collaborated with The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to further study the pharmacology of our nusinersen SNA in mouse models. We tested nusinersen SNA in Δ7 SMA mouse model in which the untreated SMA-bearing mice have mean survival of approximately 15 days. Newborn Δ7 SMA mice were treated with a single dose of nusinersen SNA or nusinersen at 10, 20 or 30 μg by via intracerebroventricular injection on day 0. Following administration of compounds, mouse survival and body weights were recorded.
Nusinersen in SNA format prolonged survival compared to linear nusinersen in Δ7 SMA mice. The 20 μg treatment group is shown below.
In June 2018, we and researchers from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center presented a poster at the Cure SMA Annual Conference titled: “Nusinersen in spherical nucleic acid (SNA) format improves efficacy both in vitro in SMA patient fibroblasts and in Δ7 SMA mice and reduces toxicity in mice.” It was observed in a preclinical study that nusinersen in SNA format prolonged survival by four-fold (maximal survival of 115 days compared to 28 days for nusinersen-treated mice) as well as doubled the levels of healthy full-length SMN2 mRNA and protein in SMA patient fibroblasts when compared to nusinersen. 
In June 2019, we announced data from a preclinical study evaluating the biodistribution of SNAs in the non-human primate central nervous system. In our study, 7 mg of radio-labeled SNAs were injected intrathecally into cynomolgus monkeys. The biodistribution of the SNAs was followed for 14 days by PET/CT scans. SNAs were observed throughout the entire brain and were found both in the brain stem as well as inside the brain. High content of SNA was observed in all 46 regions of the brain examined. These key data indicate that the SNA platform may be well-suited for development of new therapeutics directed towards diseases of the central nervous system.
Dermatology, Hair loss disorders
In November 2019, we signed a collaboration agreement with Allergan to develop SNA-based treatments for hair loss disorders. This collaboration is a combination of our knowledge of nucleic acid therapeutics and dermatology with Allergan’s expertise in medical aesthetics. On May 8, 2020, Allergan was acquired by AbbVie. Together with AbbVie, we continue to progress these collaboration activities.
Immuno-oncology, cavrotolimod (AST-008)
Cavrotolimod (AST-008) is a toll-like receptor 9, or TLR9, agonist designed for immuno-oncology applications utilizing the key strengths of our SNA technology. TLR9 agonists bind to and activate TLR9. We believe cavrotolimod (AST-008) may be used for anti-infective and immuno-oncology applications with the latter in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. 
On December 10, 2021, in connection with our announcement to implement strategic measures to reduce cash burn and prioritize our pipeline focus, we announced the wind-down of our cavrotolimod (AST-008). We have discontinued further enrollment of the ongoing Phase1b/2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. We are currently pursuing various strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value of cavrotolimod, including pursuit of out-licensing activities. 
Phase 2 clinical development of cavrotolimod (AST-008)
Using data from the completed Phase 1b stage of our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, a recommended Phase 2 dose of 32 mg cavrotolimod (AST-008) was identified for the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, whereby cavrotolimod (AST-008) was given in combination with pembrolizumab or cemiplimab for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, or MCC, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, respectively, in patients with progression despite approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. This trial was designed to enroll two separate cohorts of up to 29 patients with advanced or metastatic MCC or CSCC who have failed anti-PD-1/PD-L1, or programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1, therapy. In addition, we added an exploratory cohort to include patients with melanoma who have progressed on PD-(L)-1 therapy and MCC patients who do not qualify for the primary MCC cohort. In June 2020, we reported that we dosed the first patient in the MCC cohort of the trial.
As of February 23, 2022, we have dosed 38 patients with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, including the primary and exploratory cohorts. As of February 23, 2022, five of the 38 patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial have experienced serious adverse events, or SAEs, assessed as related to cavrotolimod by clinical trial investigators. The treatment-related SAEs experienced by these five patients were flu-like symptoms (n=6), hypotension (n=2), and injection site reaction (n=2). No SAEs were reported in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial.
Phase 1b/2 clinical development of cavrotolimod (AST-008)
We commenced a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in patients with advanced solid tumors in late 2018. The Phase 1b stage was an open-label, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral cavrotolimod (AST-008) injections alone and in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. We have completed the enrollment of the Phase 1b stage of the clinical trial. The 20 patients from the Phase 1b stage included those with advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, or MCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, melanoma and leiomyosarcoma. At the time of enrollment, 85% of patients were experiencing progressive disease despite treatment with PD-1 blockade and 65% of patients had been treated with 2 or more lines of systemic therapy. We have presented our findings from the Phase 1b stage in multiple public disclosures, including at numerous scientific meetings, in December 2019 when we reported preliminary results showing potential signs of anti-tumor activity in patients with MCC, and at a virtual meeting we hosted in September 2020. The key results from the Phase 1b stage include:
•No observed treatment-related SAEs or dose limiting toxicity, or DLT;
•Cavrotolimod (AST-008) was well tolerated with 98% of all treatment-emergent adverse events, or AEs, assessed as Grade 1 or 2 in severity; the most common adverse events were flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, which we believe reflects local and systemic immune activation and are commonly expected effects from TLR9 activation;
•Confirmed ORR of 21% (4/19 evaluable patients) in the Phase 1b dose-escalation stage across all doses, with 1 complete response and 3 partial responses;
•Confirmed ORR 33% (2/6 patients) in the highest dose cohort (32 mg), which was selected as the Phase 2 recommended dose;
•Overall responses occurred in two patients with advanced MCC and two patients with melanoma;
•Three of four responders were progressing on anti-PD-1 therapy at the time of enrollment;
•Durable and ongoing responses, with progression-free survival exceeding six months in all four responders and 16 months in two responders;
•In addition to the four confirmed responses, target tumor shrinkage occurred in one CSCC patient and two melanoma patients, thus 37% of evaluable patients experienced target tumor shrinkage;
•Systemic or abscopal effects were observed, with regression in noninjected tumors distant from injected lesions;
•Increases in leukocytes in injected tumors after cavrotolimod (AST-008) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab versus baseline. Uninjected tumors also showed increased immune cell levels after patients received cavrotolimod (AST-008) plus pembrolizumab;
•Dose-dependent activation of key immune cells, including cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, as well as increases in cytokine/chemokine levels in patient blood after cavrotolimod (AST-008) treatment alone, and cavrotolimod (AST-008) plus pembrolizumab treatment; and
•The cavrotolimod pharmacodynamic profile corroborated the efficacy data, as increased serum cytokines/chemokines, activated immune cells, and tumor infiltration by immune cells were observed.
Phase 1 clinical development of cavrotolimod (AST-008) 
The Phase 1 clinical trial was a first-in-human clinical trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008) evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in healthy volunteers via subcutaneous dosing. The trial was a randomized, single ascending dose, or SAD, trial. Sixteen healthy subjects were recruited and organized into four SAD cohorts. We began subject dosing in the fourth quarter of 2017 and announced our initial analyses of the results of the trial on September 20, 2018. 
Based on our initial analyses of the Phase 1 clinical trial results, cavrotolimod (AST-008) was shown to be safe and tolerable in all subjects, with no SAEs and no dose limiting toxicity. Cavrotolimod (AST-008) was well tolerated and all cavrotolimod (AST-008)-related AEs were of short duration, reversible and consistent with TLR9 activation. Such AEs included flu-like symptoms, injections site reactions, and non-clinically significant lymphopenia and neutropenia. 
In addition to the principal safety and tolerability endpoint, the trial screened for levels of select cytokines and markers of immune cell activation. Cavrotolimod (AST-008) was shown to elicit high levels of certain cytokines as well as activate important effector cells of the immune system including T cells and NK cells. 
For the four subjects receiving the trial’s top dose of about 20 µg/kg of cavrotolimod (AST-008), initial analyses suggest that the average fold-increase above baseline for these cytokines is approximately as follows: IFN-gamma: 3 fold; IL-6: 57 fold; IL-12: 2 fold; IP-10: 32 fold; and MCP-1: 4 fold. 
We believe that such cytokine induction has clinical importance because these cytokines play an important role in immune system activity. IL-12, is an important T cell-stimulating factor, involved in the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells. IP-10, also known as CXCL10, acts as a chemo-attractant for macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells and in antitumor activity. IL-6 is a key player in the activation, proliferation and survival of lymphocytes during active immune responses and supports shifting the immune system from a suppressive to a responsive state that can effectively act against tumors. MCP-1, or CCL2, is a small cytokine which helps recruiting monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells.
In addition to the cytokine response, cavrotolimod (AST-008) was shown to activate important effector cells of the immune system, including NK cells which are cytotoxic lymphocytes critical to the innate immune system, and T cells which are key effector cells of the adaptive immune system. At the trial’s top dose of about 20 µg/kg, cavrotolimod (AST-008) elicited 9.5 fold and 3.5 fold increases in the fraction of activated T cells and natural killer cells, respectively, compared to baseline. NK cells continually scan the body for abnormal cells to attack. T cells form the basis of a targeted and durable immune response and immunological memory. We believe that activation by cavrotolimod (AST-008) of the key effectors cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system makes cavrotolimod (AST-008) suitable for combination with checkpoint inhibitors.
Our Collaboration Programs 
Ipsen Collaboration Agreement
On July 30, 2021, we entered into a Collaboration, Option and License Agreement with Ipsen, or Ipsen Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Ipsen Collaboration Agreement, we granted to Ipsen exclusive access and options to license SNA-based therapeutics arising from two collaboration programs related to the treatment of Huntington’s disease and Angelman syndrome (each, an “Ipsen Collaboration Program”), respectively. Each such license (obtained in connection with the exercise of an Ipsen Option, as defined and discussed further below) would grant to Ipsen exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize such SNA therapeutics. 
Under the terms of the Ipsen Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20 million, or the Ipsen Upfront Payment, and, if Ipsen exercises any of its option rights under the agreement, Ipsen will pay us an option exercise fee equal to $10 million for each such option if exercised during the first option period, or $25 million for each such option if exercised during the second option exercise period. Ipsen will also pay a pre-clinical milestone payment of $5 million for each Ipsen Collaboration Program upon achievement of such milestone regardless of whether an option is exercised.
If Ipsen exercises an option for a program, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $180 million for development and regulatory milestone payments and $762 million for product approval and sales milestone payments associated with aggregate worldwide sales. In the event a therapeutic candidate subject to the collaboration results in commercial sales, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens on future net product sales of such commercialized therapeutic candidates. A percentage of the aforementioned payments will be due to Northwestern, upon receipt, pursuant to our existing license agreements with Northwestern. 
AbbVie Collaboration Agreement
On November 13, 2019, we entered into a Collaboration, Option and License Agreement, or the “AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc, Allergan. On May 8, 2020, Allergan plc, including Allergan, was acquired by AbbVie. Pursuant to the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, we granted to AbbVie exclusive access and options to license SNA based therapeutics arising from two collaboration programs related to the treatment of hair loss disorders. Under each such license, we grant to AbbVie exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicenseable, nontransferable, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize such SNA therapeutics. 
Under the terms of the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25 million, and, if AbbVie exercises any of its option rights under the agreement, AbbVie will pay us an option exercise fee equal to 
$10 million for each exercised option, if such option is exercised during the initial option exercise period. AbbVie may extend an option exercise period beyond the applicable initial exercise period for a particular program for an additional fee. 
If AbbVie exercises an option for a program, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $55 million for development milestone payments and $132.5 million for product approval and launch milestones, per program. We are also eligible to receive up to $175 million in sales milestone payments, on a program by program basis, associated with aggregate worldwide sales. In the event a therapeutic candidate subject to the collaboration results in commercial sales, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens on future net product sales of such commercialized therapeutic candidates. A percentage of the aforementioned payments will be due to Northwestern upon receipt, pursuant to our existing license agreements with Northwestern. 
Our Intellectual Property 
Proprietary Protection 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our therapeutic candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We have been building and continue to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our current and future therapeutic candidates and our SNA technology platform. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and licensing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed or licensed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be granted or licensed to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
Patent Rights 
Our patent portfolio includes pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States and in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio consists of over 80 issued patents and allowed patent applications and over 100 pending patent applications. Our general practice is to seek patent protection in major markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, China, Japan, Australia, certain members of the European Union, among others. Majority of the issued patents and allowed patent applications are licensed from Northwestern. Among the pending patent applications, we license 22 from Northwestern, we exclusively own 77, we jointly own 1 with Seven Score Pharmaceuticals, LLC (which was assigned from Dermelix), and we jointly own 5 with Northwestern. 
Our license from Northwestern is for royalty bearing worldwide exclusive rights to the use of SNAs for therapeutic applications. Pursuant to the license, we are allowed to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell and import products covered by the licensed patent rights. 
Our SCN9A patent portfolio includes two provisional applications in the United States relating to modified oligonucleotides that reduce SCN9A mRNA and NaV1.7 channel activity in cells. The application broadly describes oligonucleotides that span select lengths of the SCN9A mRNA where we observed high target knockdown, and the use of such compounds to treat a wide range of pain conditions and related symptomology. Any patents that may issue from this application would expire by 2042. The expiration date does not take into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be applied by the U.S. Patent Office upon issuance of the patent, any terminal disclaimers that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained.
Our cavrotolimod (AST-008) patent portfolio includes 37 issued and 31 pending U.S. nonprovisional and foreign patent applications. Foreign jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection for our cavrotolimod (AST-008) patent portfolio include Canada, China, Japan, Australia, the European Union, India, South Korea and 
Mexico. Each of these applications is a composition of matter and/or method of use type application. The claims of these applications are directed to certain nanoscale constructs, liposomal particles, and multivalent nanostructures, and their methods of use for treating cancer and other disorders, with or without additional therapeutic agents such as checkpoint inhibitors. Any patents that may issue from these applications would expire between 2034 and 2040. The expiration dates do not take into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be applied by the U.S. Patent Office upon issuance of the patent, any terminal disclaimers that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. We have discontinued further enrollment of the ongoing Phase1b/2 clinical trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in patients with solid tumors. As a result, we may elect to abandon or let lapse some or all of these patents and applications.
Our XCUR-FXN patent portfolio includes one pending U.S. provisional patent application. We intend to protect the composition of matter and methods of use of XCUR-FXN. Any patent that may issue from this application would expire by 2041. The expiration date does not take into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be applied by the U.S. Patent Office upon issuance of the patent, any terminal disclaimers that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. As of December 31, 2021, we have indefinitely suspended further development of XCUR-FXN program for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia. As a result, we are unlikely to pursue this application further and may elect to abandon it.
Our XCUR17 patent portfolio includes four issued and ten pending U.S. nonprovisional and foreign patent applications. The pending applications are composition of matter and method of use type applications and include claims to one or more oligonucleotides that are 18 nucleotides in length, and methods of use for treating dermal and other disorders. Any patents that may issue from this application would expire by 2037. The expiration date does not take into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be applied by the U.S. Patent Office upon issuance of the patent, any terminal disclaimers that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. As of December 31, 2021, we are no longer actively developing XCUR17 and may elect not to pursue these patents further.
Our AST-005 patent portfolio includes three issued and seven pending U.S. nonprovisional and foreign patent applications. The applications are composition of matter and method of use type applications and include claims to an oligonucleotide that is 18 nucleotides in length, and methods of use for treating dermal and other disorders. Any patents that may issue from these applications would expire by 2035. The expiration dates do not take into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be applied by the U.S. Patent Office upon issuance of the patent, any terminal disclaimers that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. As of December 31, 2021, neither we nor any of our collaborators are actively developing AST-005 and may elect to abandon these patents.
Upon receiving FDA approval for SCN9A, cavrotolimod (AST-008), XCUR17, or AST-005, we intend to list applicable patents in the FDA’s Orange Book. 
Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. 
Trade Secret and Other Protection 
In addition to patented intellectual property, we may also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual’s relationship with the company is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be the property of the Company. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
Other Intellectual Property Rights 
We seek trademark protection in the United States when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection for the following marks: EXICURE and Exicure logo. We currently have one registered trademark, EXICURE. 
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party intellectual property holders. 
Northwestern University License Agreements 
In September 2009, Northwestern and AuraSense LLC, or ASLLC, our former parent, entered into a license agreement, or the Northwestern University License Agreement, under which Northwestern granted ASLLC an exclusive, worldwide license under certain Northwestern patents and patent applications to exploit products and processes in the field of the use of nanoparticles, nanotechnology, microtechnology or nanomaterial-based constructs as or accompanying therapeutics or theradiagonostics and in or for intracellular diagnostic applications and intracellular research. On December 12, 2011, ASLLC assigned to us all of its worldwide rights and interests under the Northwestern ASLLC license in the field of the use of nanoparticles, nanotechnology, microtechnology or nanomaterial-based constructs as therapeutics or accompanying therapeutics as a means of delivery, but expressly excluding diagnostics, or assigned field. For purposes of the assigned field, therapeutic uses means the use of products and processes that are covered by the patents and patent applications licensed from Northwestern for the purpose of providing a therapy or course of medical treatment to address a medical condition or disease. In accordance with the terms and conditions of this assignment, we assumed all liabilities and obligations of ASLLC to Northwestern as set forth in its license agreement in the assigned field and in August 2015 we entered into a restated license agreement with Northwestern, or Restated License Agreement. In February 2016, we obtained exclusive license as to Northwestern’s rights in certain SNA technology we jointly own with Northwestern, or Co-owned Technology License. The Company’s license to Northwestern’s rights is limited to the assigned field, however we have no such limitation as to our own rights in this jointly owned technology. The Northwestern University License Agreements provide to us the exclusive, worldwide right to make, have made, use, modify, sell, offer for sale and import any product or process that is covered by any claim in the licensed Northwestern patents and patent applications. We have the right to sublicense these rights to third parties. The Northwestern University License Agreements require us to use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with demand in the marketplace, regulatory procedures and industry conditions and development timelines, to research, develop, market and manufacture the licensed products. 
Our rights under the Northwestern University License Agreements are subject to a variety of material limitations. First, the license specifically excludes use of the licensed patent rights to perform qualitative or quantitative in vitro analysis, testing, or measurement as well as detection of a variety of combinations of biodiagnostics field subsets and targets. Second, the license specifically prohibits us from using the licensed patent rights with regard to diagnostics, including without limitation, theradiagnostics. Third, though the license is otherwise exclusive in the assigned field, Northwestern retains the right to use the licensed patent rights for research, teaching, and other educational purposes, including the right to distribute and publish materials related to the licensed patent rights. Fourth, the license is subject to the rights of the U.S. government under any and all applicable laws including substantially manufacturing all licensed products in the U.S. unless such requirement is waived by the U.S. government. Fifth, other than in certain circumstances, the Northwestern University License Agreements are non-transferable without the consent of Northwestern. Under the terms of the Northwestern University License Agreements, depending on the circumstances, either we or Northwestern can sue to enforce the patent rights against third party infringers. 
In order to secure the assignment of the Northwestern ASLLC license in the field, we assumed the obligation to pay Northwestern an annual license fee, which may be credited against any royalties based on sales of licensed products that are due to Northwestern in the same year, and to reimburse Northwestern for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. In addition, we assumed the obligation to pay Northwestern royalties at a low single-digit percentage of any net revenue generated by our sale or transfer of any licensed product. In the event we grant a sublicense under the licensed patent rights, we also assumed the obligation to pay Northwestern, on a quarterly basis, a percentage of all sublicense payments we receive, and the greater of a 
mid-teen percentage of all sublicensee royalties or a low single-digit percent of any net revenue generated by a sublicensee’s sale or transfer of any licensed product. 
We may terminate the Northwestern University License Agreements at any time by providing 90 days written notice to Northwestern. Northwestern may terminate the agreements or, alternatively, convert our exclusive rights to non-exclusive rights if we fail to comply with certain prescribed timelines for research, development, marketing and manufacturing milestones for the licensed products. Northwestern may also terminate the agreements if we sue, or do not terminate all agreements with a sublicensee who sues Northwestern, in a matter not arising from the agreements themselves. Either party may terminate the agreements in the event of a material breach by the other that remains uncured for a period of 30 days after the non-breaching party provides notice to the breaching party. The agreements will automatically terminate if we reach specified thresholds of financial distress. In the event of termination, all rights immediately revert to Northwestern. The agreements will automatically expire upon the expiration of the last to expire patent rights. In the event of expiration, the license automatically becomes a non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid license to use or sublicense the use of know-how to make and sell products in each country where the license had previously been in effect. 
Our intellectual property strategy 
Our strategy around protection of our proprietary technology, including any innovations and improvements, is to obtain worldwide patent coverage with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical markets. Generally, patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid and the patent has not been invalidated. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended, for example, by patent term adjustment or extension, or shortened, for example, by terminal disclaimer. We are pursuing patent protection in jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical market for at least novel molecules, compositions of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, including treatment of disease, methods of manufacture and other novel uses for the inventive molecules originating from our research and development efforts. We continuously assess whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain confidentiality for the “know-how” regarding a novel invention rather than pursue patent protection. For each patent application that is filed we strategically tailor our claims in accordance with the existing patent landscape around a particular technology. 
There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent can be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences and other third party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent or limit patent claims such that patent coverage lacks sufficient breadth to protect subject matter that is commercially relevant. Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product has expired or will be in force for only a short period of time following commercialization. We cannot predict with any certainty if any third party U.S. or foreign patent rights, or other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our partners against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We may also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. 
It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the 
commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual’s relationship with the company is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be the property of the company. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection, preserve trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the U.S. and other territories worldwide.
Manufacturing and Supply 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our therapeutic candidates. We currently contract with two therapeutic substance and two drug product manufacturers for the supply of SNAs and we expect to continue to do so to meet our preclinical supply needs and any future clinical requirements of our therapeutic candidates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. 
We have agreements for the supply of such therapeutic materials with manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. We have observed minor delays in receipt of key chemicals, reagents and materials as certain manufacturers have had supply disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations manufacture our therapeutic candidates subject to cGMP conditions. cGMPs are regulatory requirements for the production of therapeutics that will be used in humans.
Competition 
We believe that our scientific knowledge, facilities, and expertise in oligonucleotide chemistry and SNA-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop oligonucleotide based-therapeutics. However, we face competition at the technology and therapeutic indication levels from both large and small biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
Our success will be based in part upon our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products in the treatment of our targeted patients. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapeutics we may develop. 
Competition in oligonucleotide-based therapeutics 
There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and oligonucleotide therapeutics fields. We believe that while our SNA technology, its associated intellectual property and our scientific and technical know-how gives us a competitive advantage in this space, competition from many sources remains. 
Our competition includes larger and better funded pharmaceutical, biotechnological and oligonucleotide therapeutic firms. Moreover, we not only compete with other firms, but also with current and future therapeutics. 
We are aware of several companies that are developing oligonucleotide delivery platforms and oligonucleotide based therapeutics. These competitors include Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus Biopharma Corp., Wave Life Sciences Ltd., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Stoke Therapeutics, Inc., Neubase Therapeutics, Inc., Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Avidity Biosciences, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dyne Therapeutics, Inc., Atalanta Therapeutics, Inc., PepGen, Inc. and others. These and other competitors compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent, and for the finite funding available from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
Our success will partially depend on our ability to develop and protect therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our commercial opportunity and success will be reduced or eliminated if competing products are safer, more effective, or less expensive than the therapeutics we develop. 
If our lead therapeutic candidates are approved for the indications for which we undertake clinical trials, they will compete with therapies that are either in development or currently marketed, such as the following:
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, sales, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our therapeutic candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. government regulation 
NDA approval processes. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, we may become 
subject to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: 
•refusal to approve pending applications; 
•license suspension or revocation; 
•withdrawal of an approval; 
•imposition of a clinical hold; 
•warning or untitled letters; 
•seizures or administrative detention of product; 
•product recalls; 
•total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
•injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
The process required by the FDA before a therapeutic candidate may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic candidate for its intended use; 
•submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the therapeutic candidate is produced to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the therapeutic candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain any approvals for our therapeutic candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
Once a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the therapeutic. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials results to public registries. 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. 
•Phase 1-The therapeutic candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the therapeutic candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
•Phase 2-Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
•Phase 3-Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the therapeutic candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
During the development of a new therapeutic candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the therapeutic candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the therapeutic candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the therapeutic candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the therapeutic candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the therapeutic candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. 
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. 
The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved products. Application fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review. Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A therapeutic representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS plan is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The FDA will not approve an NDA without a REMS plan, if required. In determining whether a REMS plan is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the therapeutic, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the therapeutic, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the therapeutic is a new molecular entity. A REMS plan may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the therapeutic, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the therapeutic. In addition, the REMS plan must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. 
The FDA may also require a REMS plan for a therapeutic that is already on the market if it determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS plan is necessary to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
If the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if the NDA is resubmitted, FDA may again decide that the resubmitted NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
Companion Diagnostics. The FDA has issued a final guidance document addressing the agency’s policy in relation to in vitro companion diagnostic tests. The guidance explains that for some therapeutics, the use of a companion diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, such as when the use of a product is limited to a specific patient subpopulation that can be identified by using the test. According to the guidance, the FDA generally will not approve such a product if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for the appropriate indication, and accordingly the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously. However, the FDA may decide that it is appropriate to approve such a product without an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device when the therapeutic is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of a product with an unapproved or uncleared in vitro companion diagnostic device are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. 
Expedited review and approval. The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing therapeutic candidates, or provide for the approval of a therapeutic candidate on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a therapeutic candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the therapeutic candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, therapeutic candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapeutic candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give a therapeutic candidate that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, an initial review within eight months as compared to a standard review time of twelve months. 
Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated therapeutic candidate and expedite review of the application for a therapeutic candidate designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new therapeutic candidate that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a therapeutic candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a therapeutic candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the therapeutic is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapeutic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to, an IND, but ideally no later than the end of the Phase 2 meeting. 
Similar to FDASIA, the Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, includes numerous provisions intended to accelerate the development of new products regulated by the FDA. As an example, the Cures Act provides that the FDA may allow the sponsor of an NDA for a genetically targeted drug or variant protein targeted drug to rely upon data and information previously developed by the same sponsor (or another sponsor that has provided the sponsor with a contractual right of reference to such data and information) and submitted by the sponsor in support of one or more previously approved applications submitted to the FDA for a drug that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or the same variant protein targeted drug. 
Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the therapeutic candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved therapeutic candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A therapeutic candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new therapeutic candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the therapeutic candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such therapeutic candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing therapeutic candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for therapeutic candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
Orphan drug designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a therapeutic candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that therapeutic candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic for that particular disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. 
If a therapeutic candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the therapeutic candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same therapeutic candidate as defined by the FDA or if our therapeutic candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s therapeutic candidate for the same indication or disease. 
Pediatric exclusivity and pediatric use. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the therapeutic candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines that information relating to the use of a therapeutic candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the therapeutic candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. The FDA also must post the PREA noncompliance letter and sponsor’s response. 
Post-approval requirements. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the therapeutic candidate reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a therapeutic candidate may result in restrictions on the therapeutic candidate or even complete withdrawal of the therapeutic candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved therapeutic candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved therapeutic candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a therapeutic candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
Any therapeutic candidates manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 
•record-keeping requirements; 
•reporting of adverse experiences associated with the therapeutic candidate; 
•providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
•therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements; 
•notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and 
•complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may in their independent medical judgment prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Manufacturers may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and criminal actions.
Therapeutic manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutic candidates are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use if our therapeutic candidates are approved. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and the third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties. We cannot be certain we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials or require us to recall a product from distribution. 
New Legislation and Regulations. From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be. 
Regulation outside of the U.S. 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our therapeutic candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 became directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. 
In the EU, a company may submit a marketing authorization application either: (i) at the national level with the national competent authorities in one EU Member State, referred to as the national procedure; (ii) via mutual recognition of a national authorization in other EU Member States, referred to as the mutual recognition procedure; (iii) at the national level in several EU Member States, or the decentralized procedure; or (iv) at centralized level with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, referred to as the centralized procedure. The national procedure allows the applicant to choose the EU Member State in which they wish to first submit an application. The mutual recognition procedure allows a marketing authorization granted in one EU Member State via the national procedure 
to be recognized in other EU Member States. The decentralized procedure allows a medicine that has not yet been authorized in the EU to be authorized in several EU Member States. The centralized procedure, whereby a medicine receives marketing authorization in all EU Member States, is compulsory for certain medicines and is optional for other types of medicines if the applicant can show eligibility. 
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a therapeutic candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the product in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must also demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the product has to be of significant benefit compared to products available for the condition. 
 An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. The grant of a marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the Member States can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for the same therapeutic indication in respect of a “similar medicinal product”. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. There are a number of derogations from the ten-year period of market exclusivity pursuant to which the European Commission may grant a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product in the same therapeutic indication, including where the second applicant can establish that although their product is similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, the second product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
Healthcare Reform 
In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, and fraud and abuse, impacting existing government healthcare programs and resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives, and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Other aspects of the ACA include, but are not limited to: 
•Increases in pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program due to an increase in the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs, and the application of Medicaid rebate liability to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans. 
•Expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program to require discounts for “covered outpatient drugs” sold to certain children’s hospitals, critical access hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospital. 
•Requirements on pharmaceutical companies to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the “Donut Hole.” 
•Requirements on manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.

•Requirements on pharmaceutical companies to pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on each company’s market share of prior year total sales of branded drugs to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense. 
•Establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 
•Establishment the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the sale, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways significantly affecting our business and our products. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or congressional challenges in the future.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory marketing approval will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. 
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the federal Medicaid program (a program for financially needy patients, among others), requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. 
In order for a pharmaceutical product to (i) receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B (the part of the federal Medicare program covering outpatient items and services for the aged and disabled) or (ii) be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program, which is a federal program that requires manufacturers to provide discounts to 
certain statutorily defined safety-net providers. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics the manufacturer is required to report to CMS. The failure to report or the misreporting of such pricing metrics could result in significant civil monetary penalties and fines for each item of false or omitted information and per day per labeler code for each day the submission of such pricing information is late beyond the due date. 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
In the United States, no uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products among third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which may not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Furthermore, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. Additionally, if any companion diagnostic provider is unable to obtain reimbursement or is inadequately reimbursed, that may limit the availability of such companion diagnostic, which would negatively impact prescriptions for our product candidates, if approved.
Further, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to the U.S. Congress. In addition, the ACA requires, among other things, that AHRQ broadly disseminate findings from federally funded comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our therapeutic candidates if any such therapeutic, or the condition that it is intended to treat, is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our therapeutic candidates. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by the U.S. Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. 
At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Finally, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a therapeutic candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing therapeutic pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are regulated at a national level under the individual EU Member States’ social security systems. Some foreign countries provide options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control 
the prices of medicinal products for human use. A country may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our therapeutic candidates. Even if approved for reimbursement, historically, therapeutic candidates launched in some foreign countries such as some countries in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and prices generally tend to be significantly lower. 
Other Healthcare, Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 

If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing strategies. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy as well as information security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil monetary and criminal penalties, per kickback plus three times the amount of remuneration and a prison term per violation. Further, violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also form the basis for False Claims Act liability (discussed below). The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on allegedly inappropriate consulting, discounting and other financial arrangements with physicians and others in a position to refer patients to receive items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only government programs. 
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties, including for each false claim and treble the amount of the government’s damages. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal government continues to use the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations and prosecutions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S. Such investigations and prosecutions frequently involve, for example, the alleged promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with the False Claims Act and other applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
We may be subject to the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Federal government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. 
The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes a fraud and abuse provision referred to as the HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Law, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
We may also be subject to federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the ACA and requires manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics, among others, to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members in the manufacturer. This information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Failure to disclose required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and/or other healthcare providers. 
Finally, as noted above, analogous state laws and regulations, such as, state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. There are also state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Similarly, many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Environment 
Our third party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio. We currently do not have marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we intend to market the product through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third 
parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our therapeutic candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates, the availability of funds and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 47 full time employees, of which 37 were engaged in R&D activities and 10 were engaged in finance, legal, human resources, business development and general management. In December 2021, we implemented a reduction in force of approximately 50% of our workforce. We have no collective bargaining agreement with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Exicure a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs.
Our base pay program aims to compensate staff members at market levels and relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. In addition to salaries, our compensation program includes potential annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards under our equity incentive program, a 401(k) Plan with matching contributions, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, and flexible paid time off to allow our employees to balance their obligations both professionally and personally. We use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical skills and experience. Potential annual discretionary bonuses are pursuant to our annual incentive programs to reward eligible staff in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company. All staff also participate in a regular performance measurement process that aligns pay to performance and through which staff receive performance and development feedback.
Our benefit programs are generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All full-time staff members are eligible to participate in the same core health and welfare and retirement savings plans.
For individuals that were impacted in our December 2021 reduction in force, we supported them with market-based severance, COBRA subsidy and outplacement assistance. For individuals that were retained in the restructuring, we have provided them with additional, market-level incentives to stay with us and facilitate business continuity.
Our Compensation Committee provides oversight over our compensation strategy including review of our plans, policies, and programs.
In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and related public health directives, orders and guidance, and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, we have continued flexible work-from-home practices to support the community efforts to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and protect employees, complying with guidance from federal, state/provincial or municipal government and health authorities. We continue measures to ensure employee safety and business continuity which have allowed us to generally operate with 100% of our R&D staff on-site. Our office and general and administrative team continues to work both from home and in the office, based on the needs of their schedule. We are proactively managing staffing, and are taking other appropriate managerial actions to maintain progress on our preclinical and collaboration programs as necessary. For on-site employees, we have continued additional safety measures, including access to and reimbursement for testing and vaccination, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, and under certain circumstances, requiring COVID-19 testing to access our workplace. 
Corporate Information
We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 6, 2017 under the name “Max-1 Acquisition Corporation.” Prior to the Merger (as defined below), Max-1 was a “shell” company registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with no specific business plan or purpose until it began operating the business of Exicure Operating Company (Exicure OpCo) through a transaction on September 26, 2017, or the Merger. Exicure OpCo was originally formed as a limited liability company under the name AuraSense Therapeutics, LLC in the State of Delaware in June 2011 and was a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing gene regulatory and immuno-oncology therapeutics based on its proprietary SNA technology. AuraSense Therapeutics, LLC was subsequently converted into AuraSense Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on July 9, 2015, and changed its name on the same date to Exicure, Inc. Immediately after giving effect to the Merger and the initial closing of a private placement transaction on September 26, 2017, the business of Exicure OpCo became our business.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 2430 N. Halsted St., Chicago, Illinois 60614, and our telephone number is (847) 673-1700.
