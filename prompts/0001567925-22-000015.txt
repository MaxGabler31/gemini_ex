Item 1. Business.
General Description of Business and Operations
Sila Realty Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that was formed on January 11, 2013, and has elected, and currently qualifies, to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Sila Realty Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or the Operating Partnership, formed on January 10, 2013. Sila Realty Trust, Inc. is the sole general partner and owns directly, all of the interests in the Operating Partnership. Except as the context otherwise requires, “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to Sila Realty Trust, Inc., our Operating Partnership and all wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Prior to September 30, 2020, our Former Advisor was responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement among us, the Operating Partnership and our Former Advisor. On July 28, 2020, we and the Operating Partnership entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, to provide for the internalization of the external management functions previously performed for us and the Operating Partnership by our Former Advisor and its affiliates, or the Internalization Transaction. On September 30, 2020, we closed the Internalization Transaction. Effective September 30, 2020, as a result of the Internalization Transaction, our Former Advisor is no longer affiliated with us.
Upon completion of the Internalization Transaction, individuals who were previously employed by an affiliate of our Former Advisor became employees of us and the functions previously performed by our Former Advisor were internalized by us. As an internally managed company, we no longer pay our Former Advisor and its affiliates any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the advisory agreement.
Our objective is to invest primarily in quality income-producing commercial real estate properties, with a focus on healthcare properties, preferably with long-term leases to creditworthy tenants, as well as to make other real estate-related investments in such property types, which may include equity or debt interests in other real estate entities. Prior to July 22, 2021, we also invested in data centers, however we sold all of our data centers on July 22, 2021. See further discussion about the data centers sale under the Disposition of Data Center Properties section below.
We raised the equity capital for our real estate investments through two public offerings, or our Offerings, from May 2014 through November 2018, and we have offered shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, pursuant to two Registration Statements on Form S-3 (each, a “DRIP Offering” and together the "DRIP Offerings") since November 2017. As of December 31, 2021, we had accepted investors’ subscriptions for and issued approximately 154,482,000 shares of Class A, Class I, Class T and Class T2 common stock in our Offerings, resulting in receipt of gross proceeds of approximately $1,495,252,000, before share repurchases of $126,484,000, selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $96,734,000 and other offering costs of approximately $27,627,000. 
SC Distributors, LLC, an affiliate of our Former Advisor, or our Dealer Manager, served as the dealer manager of our Offerings. Effective September 30, 2020, as a result of the Internalization Transaction, the Dealer Manager is no longer affiliated with us. The Dealer Manager received fees for services related to our Offerings. We continue to pay the Dealer Manager a distribution and servicing fee with respect to Class T2 shares that were sold in our Offerings. Effective December 31, 2021, we no longer pay the Dealer Manager a distribution and servicing fee with respect to our Class T shares.
Our shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of the stockholders. In the event we do not achieve a liquidity event on or before the seventh anniversary of the completion or termination of the primary offering of our initial public offering, or November 24, 2024, our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend or eliminate the deadline to achieve a liquidity event (which would require the approval of our stockholders); or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio. A liquidity event could include a sale of all or substantially all our assets, a sale or merger of our company, a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (provided we meet the then applicable listing requirements), or other similar transaction.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned 125 real estate healthcare properties, comprising of approximately 5,245,000 rentable square feet of single-tenant and multi-tenant commercial space located in 54 metropolitan statistical areas, or MSA, and two micropolitan statistical areas, or µSA. As of December 31, 2021, the rentable space of these real estate healthcare properties was 99.5% leased. Additionally, we owned one land parcel held for sale that formerly contained a healthcare property and two undeveloped land parcels as of December 31, 2021.
We have historically established, and intend to continue to establish, an estimated per share net asset value, or Estimated Per Share NAV, on at least an annual basis. Each Estimated Per Share NAV was determined by our board of directors, or the Board, after consultation with an independent third-party valuation firm. The Estimated Per Share NAV is not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm. The following table outlines the established Estimated Per Share NAV as determined by the Board for the last three years as of each valuation date presented below:
Valuation Date | Effective Date | Estimated Per Share NAV | 
October 31, 2019 | December 18, 2019 | $8.65 | 
September 30, 2020 | December 8, 2020 | $8.69 | 
May 31, 2021 | July 26, 2021 | $9.95 | (1)
May 31, 2021 | July 26, 2021 | $8.20 | (1)

(1)On July 22, 2021, we announced the Estimated Per Share NAV that the Board, at the recommendation of our audit committee, or the Audit Committee, approved on July 20, 2021, which was calculated as of May 31, 2021, of $9.95. Upon the declaration of a special cash distribution of $1.75 per share to stockholders of record on July 26, 2021, the new Estimated Per Share NAV is $8.20.
The Estimated Per Share NAV was determined after consultation with Cushman & Wakefield of Pennsylvania, LLC, or Cushman & Wakefield, an independent third-party valuation firm. Cushman & Wakefield prepared an appraisal report, or the Appraisal Report, summarizing key information and assumptions and providing an appraised value on 124 of the 154 properties, or the Cushman & Wakefield Appraised Properties, in our portfolio as of May 31, 2021. Cushman & Wakefield also prepared a net asset value report, or the NAV Report, and, together with the Appraisal Report, or the Reports, which estimates the NAV of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock, Class T common stock and Class T2 common stock as of May 31, 2021. 
Cushman & Wakefield employed the income capitalization approach and sales comparison approach to estimate the value of the Cushman & Wakefield Appraised Properties.
Income Capitalization Approach – This first determines the income-producing capacity of a property by using contract rents on existing leases and by estimating market rent from rental activity at competing properties for the vacant space. Deductions are then made for vacancy and collection loss and operating expenses. The resulting net operating income is divided by an overall capitalization rate to derive an opinion value. This method is referred to as Direct Capitalization. Related to the Direct Capitalization method is the Discounted Cash Flow method, in which periodic cash flows are discounted to a present value using an internal rate of return that is determined by analyzing current investor yield requirements for similar investments. Cushman & Wakefield utilized the Income Capitalization Approach to estimate the value for 120 of 124 Appraised Properties. The following summarizes the key assumptions that were used in the discounted cash flow and direct capitalization methods to arrive at the appraised value of the Cushman & Wakefield Appraised Properties: 
 | Range | Weighted Average
Terminal Capitalization Rate | 6.75% | 7.75% | 6.97%
Discount Rate | 7.75% | 8.75% | 7.81%
Direct Capitalization Rate | 5.50% | 8.50% | 6.81%
Income and Expense Growth | 2.00% | 2.00% 

Cushman & Wakefield used the contract purchase price, less estimated transaction costs, for the value of the 29 data center properties that were a part of the Data Center Sale (as defined below).
Sales Comparison Approach – The sales comparison approach estimates value based on what other purchasers and sellers in the market have agreed to as the price for comparable improved properties. This approach is based upon the principle of substitution, which states that the limits of prices, rents, and rates tend to be set by the prevailing prices, rents, and rates of equally desirable substitutes. Cushman & Wakefield utilized the Sales Comparison Approach to estimate the value for 4 of 124 Appraised Properties.
The Appraisal Report summarizes key inputs and assumptions and provides a value for each of the Cushman & Wakefield Appraised Properties that Cushman & Wakefield appraised using financial information provided by us. From such review, Cushman & Wakefield selected the appropriate cash flow discount rates, residual discount rates, and terminal capitalization rates in its discounted cash flow analysis and the appropriate direct capitalization rate in its direct capitalization analysis. For the Sales Comparison Approach, Cushman & Wakefield used a unit of comparison such as price per square foot of building area or effective gross income multiplier.
Disposition of Data Center Properties
During the second quarter of 2021, the Board made a determination to focus upon our healthcare properties and decided to sell our data center properties. On May 19, 2021, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a purchase and sale agreement, or the PSA, for the sale of 29 data center properties owned by us, which constituted the entirety of our data center segment. The decision of the Board to sell the data center properties, as well as the execution of the PSA, represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our results and operations and assets and liabilities for the periods presented. As a result, we have classified the assets and liabilities related to the data center segment as assets held for sale, net, and liabilities held for sale, net, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had no assets or liabilities held for sale related to the data center properties. The operations of the data center properties have been classified as income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for all years presented.
On July 22, 2021, we completed the sale of all 29 of our data center properties, or the Data Center Sale, for an aggregate sale price of $1,320,000,000, and generated net proceeds of approximately $1,295,367,000. See Note 3—"Acquisitions and Dispositions" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Concurrently, the Board declared a special cash distribution of $1.75 per share of Class A, Class I, Class T and Class T2 shares of common stock. The special cash distribution was funded with the proceeds from the Data Center Sale. The special cash distribution was paid on July 30, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 26, 2021, in the aggregate amount of approximately $392,685,000.
Other Key Developments during 2021 and Subsequent
•Using proceeds received from the Data Center Sale, we paid off all our notes payable (seven data center notes payable and five healthcare notes payable), with an outstanding principal balance of $450,806,000 ($305,161,000 outstanding principal balance on data center notes payable and $145,645,000 outstanding principal balance on healthcare notes payable) at the time of repayment and repaid $403,000,000 on our credit facility in order to reduce leverage and to position us for future growth. The outstanding principal balance on data center notes payable in the amount of $305,161,000 was required to be paid off in order to consummate the Data Center Sale, while the outstanding principal balance on healthcare notes payable in the amount of $145,645,000 was paid off at our sole discretion.
•During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased four operating healthcare properties, comprising approximately 186,000 of rentable square feet and two undeveloped land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $71,472,000. The two undeveloped land parcels are an aggregate of 1.52 acres and up to 73,829 square feet of space could be developed. In addition, we placed one operating healthcare property into service.
•During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold two healthcare properties for an aggregate sale price of $13,120,000 and generated net proceeds of $12,642,000.
•On February 8, 2022, we placed one operating healthcare property into service.
•On February 10, 2022, we sold one land parcel that formerly contained a healthcare property for $24,000,000. Our net proceeds at closing from the disposition were approximately $22,876,000, after transaction costs and other prorations, subject to additional transaction costs paid subsequent to the closing date.
•On February 15, 2022, we, the Operating Partnership and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, or the New Revolving Credit Agreement, with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders, for aggregate commitments available of up to $500,000,000, which may be increased, subject to lender approval, through incremental term loans and/or revolving loan commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000,000. The maturity date for the New Revolving Credit Agreement is February 15, 2026, which, at our election, may be extended for a period of six-months on no more than two occasions, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. The New Revolving Credit Agreement was entered into to replace our prior $500,000,000 revolving line of credit, which had a maturity date of April 27, 2022, with the option to extend for one twelve-month period. We did not exercise the option to extend. Upon closing of the New Revolving Credit Agreement, we extinguished all commitments associated with the prior revolving line of credit. Simultaneously with the New Revolving Credit Agreement’s execution, on February 15, 2022, we, the Operating Partnership, and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into the senior unsecured term loan agreement, or the New Term Loan Agreement, with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders. The New Term Loan Agreement was fully funded at closing, and is made up of aggregate commitments of $300,000,000, which may be increased, subject to lender approval, to an aggregate amount not to exceed $600,000,000. The New Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of December 31, 2024, and, at our election, may be extended for a period of six-months on no more than two occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. The New Term Loan Agreement was 
entered into to replace our prior term loan, which was paid off in its entirety upon closing of the New Revolving Credit Agreement and the New Term Loan Agreement. We refer to the New Revolving Credit Agreement and the New Term Loan Agreement together as our “Unsecured Credit Facility,” which have aggregate commitments available of $800,000,000.
•On March 10, 2022, we purchased one operating healthcare property, comprising approximately 45,624 of rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $19,430,000.
•As of March 18, 2022, we owned 126 real estate healthcare properties, comprising approximately 5,335,000 rentable square feet of single-tenant and multi-tenant commercial space located in 54 metropolitan statistical areas, or MSA, and two micropolitan statistical areas, or µSA. As of March 18, 2022, the rentable space of our healthcare properties was 99.4% leased. Additionally, we owned two undeveloped land parcels as of March 18, 2022.
•As of March 18, 2022, we had an outstanding principal balance of $485,000,000 under our Unsecured Credit Facility.
Investment Objectives and Policies
Our primary investment objectives are to:
•acquire high quality healthcare properties leased to tenants along the continuum of care, capitalizing on critical and structural economic growth drivers; 
•pay regular cash distributions to stockholders;
•preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders;
•realize appreciated growth in the value of our investments upon the sale of such investments in whole or in part; and
•be prudent, patient and deliberate with respect to the purchase and sale of our investments considering current and future real estate markets.
We cannot assure stockholders that we will attain these objectives or that the value of our assets will not decrease. Furthermore, within our investment objectives and policies, we have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments and the purchase and sale of our assets, subject to the approval of the Board. The Board may revise our investment objectives and policies if it determines it is in the best interest of our stockholders.
Investment Strategy
We focus our investment activities on acquiring mission critical net-leased properties that are primarily in the healthcare sector. We expect that most of our properties will continue to be located throughout the continental United States; however, we may purchase properties in other jurisdictions. We may also invest in real estate-related debt and securities that meet our investment strategy and return criteria, provided that we do not intend for such investments to constitute a significant portion of our assets, and we will evaluate our assets to ensure that any such investments do not cause us to fail to maintain our REIT status or cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
We seek to obtain investments that are (i) essential to the successful business operations of the tenant, or "mission critical"; (ii) leased to creditworthy and investment grade tenants, preferably on a net-leased basis; (iii) long-term leases, preferably with terms of six years or longer, which typically include annual or periodic fixed rental increases; and (iv) located in geographically diverse, established markets with superior access and visibility.
We may acquire properties in various stages of development or that require substantial refurbishment or renovation. We will make this determination based upon a variety of factors, including the available risk-adjusted returns for such properties when compared with other available properties, the effect such properties would have on the diversification of our portfolio, and our investment objectives of realizing both current income and capital appreciation upon the sale of such properties.
To the extent feasible, we will continue to seek to achieve a well-balanced portfolio of real estate investments that is diversified by tenancy, geographic location, age and lease maturities. We also intend to focus on acquiring properties exclusively in the high-growth healthcare sector. We expect that tenants of our properties will be diversified between national, regional and local companies.
Creditworthy Tenants
We expect the tenants and/or sponsors of the tenants of our healthcare properties to be creditworthy national or regional companies generally with high net worth and high operating income.
A tenant is considered creditworthy if it has a financial profile that we believe meets our criteria. In evaluating the creditworthiness of a tenant or prospective tenant, we will not use specific quantifiable standards, but will consider many factors, including, but not limited to, the proposed terms of the property acquisition, the financial condition of the tenant and/or sponsor, the operating history of the property with the tenant, the tenant’s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant’s industry segment, and the lease length and other lease terms at the time of the property acquisition.
We monitor the credit of our tenants to stay abreast of any material changes in credit quality. We monitor tenant credit by: (1) reviewing the credit ratings of tenants (or their parent companies) that are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies; (2) reviewing financial statements that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease; (3) monitoring news reports and other available information regarding our tenants and their underlying businesses; (4) monitoring the timeliness of rent collections; and (5) conducting periodic inspections of our properties to ascertain proper maintenance, repair and upkeep. During the year ended December 31, 2021, and subsequent, through the day of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain of our tenants experienced a deterioration in their creditworthiness, however, none of these tenants are material to our overall portfolio.
Description of Leases
We generally acquire properties subject to existing tenant leases. When spaces in properties become vacant, existing leases expire, or we acquire properties under development or requiring substantial refurbishment or renovation, we anticipate entering into net leases. Net leases typically require tenants to pay, in addition to a fixed rent, all or a majority of the costs relating to the three broad expense categories of real estate taxes (including special assessments and sales and use taxes), insurance and common area maintenance (including repair and maintenance, utilities, cleaning and other operating expenses related to the property), excluding the roof and structure of the property. Generally, the leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. As a precautionary measure, we may obtain, to the extent available, secondary liability insurance, as well as loss-of-rents insurance. Tenants are generally required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing a certificate of insurance to us on an annual basis. With respect to multi-tenant properties, we expect to have a variety of lease arrangements with the tenants of these properties. Since each lease is an individually negotiated contract between two or more parties, each lease will have different obligations of both the landlord and tenant. Many large national tenants have standard lease forms that generally do not vary from property to property. We will have limited ability to revise the terms of leases to those tenants. We expect that multi-tenant properties may be subject to "gross" or "modified gross" leases. "Gross" leases require the tenant to pay a fixed rental amount inclusive of all of the tenant's operating expenses. Any operating expenses not covered by the tenant's rental amount are the responsibility of the landlord (including any operating expense increases in subsequent years). "Modified gross" leases typically require the tenant to pay, in addition to a fixed rental amount, a portion of the operating expenses of the property.
A majority of our acquisitions generally have lease terms of six years or longer at the time of the property acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term of our properties was 9.5 years. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Most of the leases also will contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent periodically during the lease term.
Investment Decisions
We may purchase, without the specific prior approval of the Board, properties with a purchase price of less than $25,000,000, so long as the investment in the property would not, if consummated, violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness and the consideration to be paid for such properties does not exceed the fair market value of such properties. Where the purchase price is equal to or greater than $25,000,000, investment decisions will be made by the Board.
In evaluating and presenting investments for approval, we, to the extent such information is available, consider and provide to the Board, with respect to each property, the following:
•proposed purchase price, terms and conditions;
•physical condition, age, curb appeal and environmental reports;
•location, visibility and access;
•historical financial performance;
•tenant rent roll and tenant creditworthiness;
•lease terms, including rent, rent increases, length of lease term, specific tenant and landlord responsibilities, renewal, expansion, termination, purchase options, exclusive and permitted uses provisions, assignment and sublease provisions, and co-tenancy requirements;
•local market economic conditions, demographics and population growth patterns;
•neighboring properties; and
•potential for new property construction in the area.
Investing in and Originating Loans
Our criteria for originating or acquiring loans are substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties. We may invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. Further, we may invest in unsecured loans or loans secured by assets other than real estate; however, we will not make unsecured loans or loans not secured by mortgages unless such loans are approved by the Board.
Our underwriting process typically involves comprehensive financial, structural, operational and legal due diligence. We do not require an appraisal of the underlying property from a certified independent appraiser for an investment in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans.
We will not make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans outstanding on the property, including our borrowings, would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, unless substantial justification exists, as determined by the Board, including a majority of our independent directors. The Board may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans in cases in which it believes there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property or we intend to foreclose upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets.
We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or we may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders. We will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the term of the loan, the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meet our investment criteria and objectives.
Investing in Real Estate Securities
We may invest in non-majority owned securities of both publicly-traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. We may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire such securities. However, any investment in equity securities (including any preferred equity securities) that are not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an over-the-counter market must be approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable.
Acquisition Structure
We have and expect to continue to acquire fee interests in properties (a fee interest is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although other methods of acquiring a property may be utilized if we deem them to be advantageous.
To achieve our investment objectives, and to further diversify our portfolio, we have invested and will continue to invest in properties using a number of acquisition structures, which could include direct and indirect acquisitions, joint ventures, leveraged investments, issuing units in our Operating Partnership in exchange for properties and making mortgages or other loans secured by the same types of properties which we may acquire.
Joint Ventures
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership partnerships for the purpose of making investments. Some of the potential reasons to enter into a joint venture would be to acquire assets we could not otherwise acquire, to reduce our capital commitment to a particular asset, or to benefit from certain expertise a partner might have. In determining whether to invest in a particular joint venture, we evaluate the assets of the joint venture under the same criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the selection of our investments. We also evaluate the terms of the joint venture as well as the financial condition, operating capabilities and integrity of our partner or partners.
Disposition Policy
We intend to hold each asset we acquire for an extended period of time, generally five to seven years, or for the life of the Company. However, circumstances may arise that could result in the earlier sale of some assets. The determination of whether an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, specific real estate market conditions, tax implications for our stockholders, and other factors. The 
requirements for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes also will put some limits on our ability to sell assets after short holding periods.
We may, with the prior approval of the Board, dispose of an asset or asset portfolios with a contract sale price of $15,000,000 or less, using the greater of (i) the most recent net asset value for such asset or asset portfolio, as determined by an independent third-party expert and (ii) the contract sale price of such asset or asset portfolio. Where the sale price is greater than $15,000,000, decisions will be made by the Board.
The sale price of a property that is net-leased will be determined in large part by the amount of rent payable under the lease and the capitalization rate applied to that rent. If a tenant has a repurchase option at a formula price, we may be limited in realizing any appreciation. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. The terms of payment will be affected by the area in which the property being sold is located and the then-prevailing economic conditions.
Qualification as a REIT
We elected, and currently qualify, to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we would then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
Financing Strategy and Policies
We believe that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objectives and has the potential to maximize returns to our stockholders. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at a later time. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. We intend to limit our aggregate borrowings to 50% of the fair market value of our assets, unless excess borrowing is approved by the Board.
Distribution Policy
The amount of distributions we pay to our stockholders is determined by the Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and restrictions imposed by our organizational documents and Maryland law.
We currently pay, and intend to continue to pay, monthly distributions to our stockholders. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund distributions, we may borrow or sell assets in order to fund distributions, or make distributions out of net proceeds from potential future offerings. We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations. Subject to certain exceptions, there is no limit to the amount of distributions that we may pay out of net proceeds from potential future offerings.
In accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
To the extent that distributions to our stockholders are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions are taxable as ordinary income. To the extent that our distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital to our stockholders for federal income tax purposes, to the extent of their basis in their stock, and thereafter will constitute a capital gain. 
See Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Distributions," for further discussion on distribution rates approved by the Board.
Insurance
See the section captioned “—Description of Leases” above.
Competition
As we continue to purchase properties for our portfolio, we are in competition with other potential buyers (some of whom have more cash, available liquidity, and/or offer competitive advantages against us in the acquisition of properties) for the same properties and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers, or we may have to locate another property that meets our investment criteria. Although we generally acquire properties subject to existing leases, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we determine to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Leases
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash on deposit, including restricted cash and escrowed funds, in certain financial institutions that had deposits in excess of current federally insured levels. We limit cash investments to financial institutions with high credit standing; therefore, we believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on our cash deposits. To date, we have not experienced any loss of or lack of access to cash in our accounts.
As of December 31, 2021, 100% of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations were generated from real estate investments in healthcare properties.
Based on leases of our properties in effect as of December 31, 2021, one exposure to tenant concentration accounted for 10% or more of our rental revenue from continuing operations as of December 31, 2021. The following table shows the tenant that accounted for 10% or more of our rental revenue from continuing operations as of December 31, 2021:

Governmental Regulations
Our real estate properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory laws and requirements, including, but not limited to, zoning regulations, building codes and land use laws and building, accessibility, occupancy and other permit requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us.
Environmental Matters
All real properties and the operations conducted on real properties are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. In connection with ownership and operation of real estate, we may be potentially liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. We intend to take all reasonable steps to fully comply with these laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of all properties that we acquire. We obtain Phase I Environmental Assessment Reports, and as needed, further environmental due diligence, including but not limited to Phase II Environmental Assessment Reports, upon each property acquisition, and, if determined necessary, during our period of ownership, to ensure that the properties that we acquire and own are free of environmental contamination and hazardous substances. We also carry environmental liability insurance on our properties, which provides coverage for pollution liability, for third-party bodily injury and property damage claims.
Taking aim at climate concerns and employees' desire for workplace flexibility, we established a hybrid workplace model. This arrangement provides more flexibility for our employees through the use of collaborative remote technologies and results in a positive impact to the environment through the reduction in commuter transportation, which results in a reduction in harmful emissions from vehicles. Additionally, effective January 2022, we are leasing Class A Office space in a newly constructed building that intends to deliver a restorative professional environment that cultivates productivity, collaboration, betterment, and balance. The neighborhood in which the new office building is located is part of a community that has achieved the WELL Design & Operations designation under the WELL Community Standard, the first neighborhood to do so globally. The WELL Building Standard takes a holistic approach to health in the built environment addressing behavior, operations and design. The building expects to achieve the WELL Building designation as well as the LEED Silver Certification in the second quarter of 2022. The new office lease is approximately 57% less square feet than our previous office space, further reducing our impact to the environment.
 Social and Governance Matters
Corporate Culture: Our core values are essential to the Company's culture. The values are critical to the success of the Company and are aligned with the Company's mission and vision statements. They define expectations for how all employees collaborate, communicate, interact and perform their roles within the Company. They describe for each employee the expectation of how "I ACT" and that is with Integrity, with Accountability, with transparent and honest Communication and embracing Teamwork. Our strong tone at the top begins with the Board, which has demonstrated its focus on advancing openness, honesty, fairness and integrity within the Company. Ethical behavior is an important cornerstone of our Company’s continued success and each of us has an obligation to report any accounting irregularity, theft, discrimination, harassment or other violation of the law. We are committed to creating an open and accountable workplace where employees feel empowered to speak up and raise issues. With this in mind, we provide multiple channels to speak up, ask for guidance, and report concerns.
Core Values: We believe that our employees are aligned around core values that inspire our behavior as individuals and as an organization. We continue to prioritize having "The Right People, In The Right Places, Doing The Right Things." This year, 
we received tenth place in the Tampa Bay Business Journal 2021 Best Places to Work award in the Large Business Category. The survey results from the competition revealed that our employees feel heard and appreciated.
Social Impact and Community: Our mission is to engage, inspire, and empower our employees to make a positive impact on our community where we work and live. We strive to support each of our employees in engaging in the community in areas where they are passionate about and taking on causes that are personally meaningful to them. Employees are encouraged to drive positive change by dedicating their time and money to non-profit organizations. The Company has a volunteer program whereby employees are provided three paid days each year to use for service to the community. Our social impact programs are in support of several non-for-profit organizations, such as Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Humane Society and Fisher House Foundation.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 63 employees, of which approximately 68% were female and 32% were male. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, minorities represented approximately 22% of our workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We aim to act with the highest integrity and operate with the highest ethical standards as we strive to create and maintain an inclusive work environment that values the uniqueness of each individual, and his or her ideas and experiences. We encourage diversity in our talent pool, noting that approximately 43% of our senior-level positions are held by women. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct annual training designed to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. We believe that our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law and are routinely recognized for outstanding performance. Our compensation and benefits program is designed to attract and retain talent and we review our compensation and benefits against market and industry benchmarks to ensure they are competitive. Our employees are offered significant flexibility to meet personal and family needs.
