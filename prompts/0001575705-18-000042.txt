--------+---------

Overview
 
First Choice Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (“FCHS,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is actively engaged in implementing a defined growth strategy aimed at building a network of localized, integrated healthcare services platforms comprised of non-physician-owned medical centers of excellence, which concentrate on treating patients in the following specialties: Orthopaedics, Spine Surgery, Interventional Pain Medicine and related diagnostic and ancillary services in key high growth markets throughout the Southeastern U.S.
 
The implementation of our business plan, thus far, has allowed us to confirm that by integrating the synergistic mix of Orthopaedic, Spine Surgery and Interventional Pain specialties with related diagnostic and ancillary services and state-of-the-art equipment and technologies across legacy brick-and-mortar boundaries, we are able to effectively:
 

● | provide patients with direct and convenient access to musculoskeletal and rehabilitative care via our best-in-class team of surgeons, physicians and care specialists, and wide array of ancillary and diagnostic services, which includes, but is not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), X-ray,durable medical equipment (“DME”) and physical/occupational therapy (“PT/OT”); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | empower physicians to collaborate as a unified care team, optimizing care coordination and improving outcomes; 
● | advance the quality and cost effectiveness of our patients’ healthcare, thereby achieving faster recoveries at materially reduced costs; and 
● | achieve strong, sustainable financial performance that serves to create long-term value for our stockholders. 

 
Managing over 100,000 patient visits each year, our flagship system (“Melbourne System”) serves Florida’s high growth Space Coast region and is comprised of the following well established Medical Centers of Excellence: First Choice Medical Group (“FCMG”), The B.A.C.K. Center (“TBC”) and Crane Creek Surgery Center (“CCSC”).

Serving Florida’s Space Coast region, FCMG, TBC and CCSC comprise our Company’s integrated healthcare services delivery platform. It is our goal to replicate our integrated platform model in other geographic markets throughout the southeast region of the United States. By centralizing current and future systems’ business management functions, including call center operations, scheduling, billing, compliance, accounting, marketing, advertising, legal, information technology and record-keeping at our corporate headquarters, we will maintain efficiencies and scales of economies. We believe our structure will enable our staff physicians to focus on the practice of medicine and the delivery of quality care to the patients we serve, as opposed to having their time and attention focused on business administration responsibilities and other business concerns.


Our Healthcare Services Business
 
Our physicians and care specialists are recruited and retained with an emphasis on best practices and attitude: that being committed to meeting and exceeding the care needs of patients and their families. Moreover, all employees –from the receptionists to the doctors – are considered caregivers who put the patient first. Our caregivers cooperate with one another through a common focus on the best interests and personal goals of each patient. We also consider family members and friends of patients to be vital components of the care team.
 
Care is focused on each patient’s full continuum of care, which requires a more personalized approach to treatment. It is the mission of our team to customize care to ensure that each patient’s needs, values and choices are always considered, which squarely aligns with our corporate slogan of “transforming healthcare delivery, one patient at a time.”
 
Our caregivers listen to and honor the perspectives and choices of patients and their families. Moreover, our caregivers communicate and share complete and unbiased information with patients and families in ways that are affirming and useful in decision-making processes. Our care delivery practices exemplify the very definition of patient-centric care, explicitly recognizing the importance of human interaction in terms of personalized care, kindness and being `present’ with patients.
 
Our patient-centric culture strives to include providing an inviting, easily accessible, peaceful, healing environment that is aesthetically pleasing and designed specifically to allay patient fear, anxiety and discomfort. The design and decor of our lobbies and diagnostic and treatment rooms are intended to define and reinforce a strong and relevant brand image of quality, patient-centered care.
 
We also utilize the most advanced diagnostic technologies coupled with the latest in individualized care, including trigger point injections and pharmacological, Physical/Occupational Therapy (“PT/OT”), Orthopaedic, Chiropractic and massage therapy treatments.
 
FCMG’s care facilities, located in Marina Towers in Melbourne, Florida, house both a digital GE X-Ray system and a GE 450 MRI Gem Suite system, which is physically positioned to capitalize on the expansive waterfront view of the Indian River, promoting patient relaxation and soothing fear and anxiety. We also operate three fully equipped outpatient physical and occupational therapy centers, where our skilled physical and occupational therapists and technicians work with our patients to help restore and improve their motion, function and quality of life.
 
In addition to our main clinical office in Melbourne, FCMG providersalso see patients at TBC’s main practice location in Melbourne, and satellite offices located in Vero Beach, Viera,Indian Harbor Beach and Suntree, Florida.
 
TBC is located only a half mile south of Marina Towers in Melbourne on the fifth and sixth floors of the Crane Creek Medical Center building. In addition to its main office in Melbourne, the practice also sees patients at a satellite office in Merritt Island, Florida, located approximately 20 miles north of Melbourne.
 
Crane Creek Surgery Center, also located in the Crane Creek Medical Center building, on the fifth floor, houses four state-of-the-art operating rooms and a medical procedure room; and has capacity to host 4,000-5,000 surgical procedures each year.
 
 Our physicians currently have hospital and surgical privileges at several healthcare facilities serving Florida’s Space Coast, including Crane Creek Surgery Center, Health First Cape Canaveral Hospital, Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center, Health First Palm Bay Hospital, Health South Sea Pines Rehabilitation Hospital, Health First Viera Hospital, Kindred Hospital of Melbourne, Melbourne Same Day Surgery Center, Melbourne Surgery Center, Steward River Medical Center, Steward Medical Center Melbourne and Steward Medical Center Rockledge.

Our Definition of a “Healthcare Services Delivery Platform”
 
As there are numerous definitions of a “Healthcare Services Delivery Platform,” we have strictly defined what we believe is qualified to be a First Choice platform to ensure that our high standards for patient care and attention can be fostered and preserved. More specifically, each of our localized platforms will:

● | be comprised of one or more medical practices focused on Orthopaedic and Spine care and treatment, and be geographically situated near one or more primary hospitals in a given, high growth geographic market; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | employ a team of first rate physicians, surgeons and care specialists all of whom are subject to our rigorous qualification and hiring process; 
● | provide for the combination of synergistic medical disciplines related to the practice of Orthopaedic and Spine medicine, while supported by related in-house diagnostic and ancillary services, including, but not limited to, ambulatory surgery center, MRI, X-Ray, DME and PT/OT – collectively, services must elegantly coalesce to provide superior patient-centric care that span a patient’s entire episode of care – from diagnosis to treatment to recovery; and 
● | capable of generating revenues of up to $65 million when the platform is fully built out, based on current reimbursement rates. 

  Because we have a specific vision for the delivery of optimal patient experience, we continually reinforce the importance of hiring, training, evaluating, compensating and supporting a workforce committed to patient-centered care. Just as vital, we engage our employees in all aspects of process design and treat them with the same dignity and respect that they are expected to show patients and family members. Central to our long-term growth strategy is attracting and recruiting top tier physicians and care specialists that rank in the top percentile of performance in the local markets we serve; and creating a work environment and corporate culture that serves to engage, motivate and retain them.
 
Our systems of operation unburden our physicians from the business administration responsibilities associated with operating a medical practice, group or clinic. More specifically, we believe that physicians will choose employment with us because we can offer them the advantages and benefits of being able to focus exclusively on delivering excellent patient care; enjoying higher income potential; realizing freedom from day-to-day practice administration, marketing and generating new patient leads; having direct access to state-of-the-art technology, diagnostics and ancillary services; and experiencing strong camaraderie with a collaborating cadre of first rate caregivers dedicated to common, patient-centered treatment goals and objectives. The requirements for running the day-to-day business functions of the Centers are the sole responsibility of our management team —and not the physicians. Simply put, First Choice allows Doctors to be Doctors.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We aim to distinguish our Medical Centers of Excellence from our competition by earning our Centers reputations as premier destinations for clinically superior, patient-centric care that is coordinated across our patients’ entire care continuums. By doing so, we expect to deliver more meaningful and collaborative doctor-patient experiences, more accurate diagnoses resulting from care coordination, effective treatment plans, faster recoveries and materially reduced costs.
 
Based on the dynamic growth taking place on Florida’s Space Coast, we are currently estimating that the total market opportunity for Orthopaedic and Spine care approximates $150 million annually, and we are working towards capturing a larger share of that market. Moreover, it is our belief that we will ultimately succeed at replicating our Melbourne Platform in other attractive, high growth geographic regions. In fact, we have identified over 250 locations in the country where we believe our unique business model can be successfully replicated and represent opportunities to build out healthcare delivery services platforms which are each capable of generating up to $65 million in annual revenues. Moving forward, with our new strategic partnership with Steward Healthcare (“Steward”) we are now concentrating our efforts on rolling out our model of care across Steward’s 36 nationwide hospitals.

In an effort to fully round out our Melbourne Platform to address a patient’s end-to-end episode of care, we have begun exploring opportunities to either acquire or organically establish the infrastructure necessary to support the offering of both pharmacy and home health services. We are also planning to expand the number of PT/OT centers that we operate to provide greater travel convenience for our patients being served by our Melbourne Platform. Currently, we own and operate three state-of-the-art PT/OT centers with the expectation in 2018 that we will expand to a total of five centers geographically situated across Brevard County, Florida, which extends 72 miles from north to south on Florida’s central eastern coast. 
 
Our longer term strategic focus is to grow by rolling out our orthopaedic and spine care platform across the 36 hospitals that make up the Steward Hospital network. by successfully replicating our Melbourne Platform – both organically and through strategic acquisitions. More specifically, our growth will be fueled by hiring best-in-class Orthopaedic physicians currently practicing in our target expansion markets and are seeking an alternative to owning and operating their own private practices or being employed by local hospitals; and by acquiring well-established Orthopaedic physician practices and medical groups in our target markets; then adding, as necessary, diagnostic and ancillary services, to include, but not be limited to, an ambulatory surgery center, MRI, X-Ray, DME and PT/OT.
 
Additional criteria for future Medical Centers of Excellence include opportunities to support economies of scale in billing, collections, purchasing, advertising and compliance which can be fully leveraged to reduce expense and fuel income growth; and opportunities to increase awareness of our brand by aligning with patients, referring physicians, medical institutions, insurers, employers and other healthcare stakeholders in local markets that share our core values.
 
Our business model is centered on our team physicians being employees, thereby permitting us to optimize revenue generation from both physicians and ancillary services, while also providing our employed care providers with the ability to refer patients to our on-site diagnostic and ancillary services. Physician-owned practices, on the other hand, may be subject to prevailing federal regulations (e.g., The Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, as amended; more commonly known as the “Stark Law”), which may limit their ability to refer patients for certain healthcare services provided by entities in which a physician-owner(s) has a financial interest.
 
We believe that our centralized system of back office operations will continue to allow us to achieve measurable cost and productivity efficiencies as we expand the number of centers and platforms we own and operate. We have specifically designed our centralized back office system to alleviate staff physicians from business administration responsibilities associated with operating a medical practice or clinic, enabling them to focus strictly on caring for the patients we serve. Physicians who own and manage their own private practices or clinics typically have to devote valuable time and resources to addressing business concerns – time and resources that might otherwise be spent on treating their patients.
 
Medical Service Mix
 
Similar to other business models for professional services, our business model is designed to offer a synergistic and profitable medical service mix. By their nature, some combinations of medical specialties can generate more revenue than others. Physicians need access to diagnostic equipment and ancillary services, such as outpatient surgery facilities, MRI, X-ray, DME and PT/OT. Moreover, most patients expect their physicians to have access to the best diagnostic and service delivery equipment. Without diagnostic services, many medical practices may find it difficult to maintain their current margins of profitability.
 
We integrate both medical specialties and ancillary and diagnostic services on our platforms to maintain or enhance our profits. While one specialty may have high reimbursements for their professional services but insufficient volume to profitably support necessary diagnostic equipment, another medical specialty may have lower professional service reimbursements but high volume of diagnostic equipment use. Operating independently, each specialty group would face retreating profit margins and confront significant challenges to maintaining high service levels with adequate equipment and advanced technologies. However, operating together, they create the optimal mix of professional service fee income, diagnostic equipment procedure income and ancillary service income. Since the combination is more profitable than the stand-alone components, there is a favorable opportunity to sustain profit margins that will allow each of our integrated healthcare services delivery platforms to maintain high service levels with state-of-the-art equipment and ancillary service offerings.
 
7


In addition, by offering healthcare services that address a patient’s entire episode of care, we believe that we are well positioned to begin offering the government, major health plans and large self-insured employer groups with bundled payment programs for a broad range of Orthopaedic and Spine surgical procedures, including total hip and knee replacements. In doing so, we believe we will be able to ultimately lower the cost of episodes of care up to 15% for these payor organizations while achieving optimal outcomes for our patient and margin expansion for our Company.
 
Scalable Back Office and Economies of Scale
 
Fixed cost legacy administrative functions have subjected many established medical centers to a downward spiral of diminishing profit margins and losses. In traditional clinical practices, administrative management, billing, compliance, accounting, marketing, advertising, scheduling, customer service and record keeping functions represent fixed overhead for the practice. There is no opportunity to share this fixed overhead with another practice. The fixed administrative overhead of a practice has the effect of reducing profit margins if the practice experiences declining revenues because of lower patient volumes, lower reimbursements or patient migration to competitors.
 
A key to our success will be our ability to continue to support a highly experienced management team with an array of professional, experienced and regulatory compliant subcontractors. Using project management best practices, our corporate managers use experienced medical subcontractors to perform billing, compliance, accounting, marketing, advertising, legal, information technology and record keeping functions on behalf of our Medical Centers of Excellence. It is our plan that the cost of our “back office operations” will not increase in direct relation to the growth of our network of integrated healthcare delivery platforms, which will allow us to sustain profit margins across our business operations with a cost effective and scalable back office. As the numbers of our care providers and Medical Centers of Excellence increase, the economies of scale for our back office operations will also increase. These economies of scale support selecting the best and not the lowest cost subcontractors, while allowing our current Melbourne Platform and future platforms to operate cost effectively with higher service levels.
 
Specifically, we currently provide all the administrative services necessary to support the practice of medicine by our physicians and improve operating efficiencies of our current and future Medical Centers of Excellence:
 

● | Recruiting and Credentialing. We have proven experience in locating, qualifying, recruiting and retaining experienced physicians. In addition to the verification of credentials, licenses and references of all prospective physician candidates, each caregiver undergoes Level 2 background checks. We maintain a national database of practicing physicians. In addition to our database of physicians, we recruit locally through trade advertising, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and referrals from our physicians and other stakeholders. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Billing, Collection and Reimbursement. We assume responsibility for contracting with third-party payors for all our physicians; and we are responsible for billing, collection and reimbursement for services rendered by our physicians. In all instances, however, we do not assume responsibility for charges relating to services provided by hospitals or other referring physicians with whom we collaborate. Such charges are separately billed and collected by the hospitals or other physicians. The majority of our third-party payors remit by EFT and wire transfers. Accordingly, every aspect of our business is positioned to achieve high productivity, lower administrative headcounts and lower per patient expense. We provide our physicians with a training curriculum that emphasizes detailed documentation of and proper coding protocol for all procedures performed and services provided; and we provide comprehensive internal auditing processes, all of which are designed to achieve appropriate coding, billing and collection of revenue for physician services. All our billing and collection operations are controlled and will continue to be controlled from our business offices located at our corporate headquarters in Melbourne, Florida.

● | Risk Management and Other Services. We maintain a risk management program focused on reducing risk, including the identification and communication of potential risk areas to our medical staff. We maintain professional liability coverage for our group of healthcare professionals. Through our risk management staff, we conduct risk management programs for loss prevention and early intervention in order to prevent or minimize professional liability claims. In addition, we provide a multi-faceted compliance program that is designed to assist our multi-specialty Medical Centers of Excellence fully comply with increasingly complex laws and regulations. We also manage all information technology, facilities management, legal support, marketing support, regulatory compliance and other services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Developing and operating additional healthcare services delivery platforms in other geographic areas will take advantage of the economies of scale for our administrative back office functions. Our business development plan calls for replicating our Melbourne Platform in other cities and states at a pace that will allow us to maintain the same levels of quality and acceptable profitability from each geographic region. We believe that the scalable structure of our administrative back office functions can efficiently support our expansion plans.
 
High Technology Infrastructure Supporting High Touch Patient Experiences
 
Successful retail models in other industries have proven effective at using telecommunications, remote computing, mobile computing, cloud computing, virtual networks and other leading-edge technologies to manage geographically diverse operating units. These technologies create an electronically distributed infrastructure which allow a central management team to monitor, direct and control geographically dispersed operating units and subcontractors, including national operations.
 
We believe that our business model incorporates the best distributed infrastructure supported by these technologies. A central management team monitors, directs and controls our medical operations, and will control our future multi-specialty Medical Centers of Excellence, as well as the necessary support subcontractors that may be required by their operations.
 
Our administrative operations are centered on a secure paperless practice management platform. We utilize a state-of-the-art, cloud-based electronic medical record (“EMR”) management system, which provides ready access to each patient’s test results from anywhere in the world where there is Internet connectivity, including X-Ray and MRI images, diagnosis, patient and doctor notes, visit reports, billing information, insurance coverage, patient identification and personalized care delivery requirements. Our EMR system fully complies with Stages 1 and 2 Meaningful Use standards defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Incentive Programs. These programs govern the use of electronic health records and allow us to earn incentive payments from the U.S. government, pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
 
We intend to grow by replicating our healthcare services delivery platform currently in place in Melbourne, Florida in other geographic markets, and by hiring additional physicians to serve patients in our current and future Medical Centers of Excellence - all of which will be supported by our standardized policies, procedures and clinic setup guidelines. We believe our administrative functions can be quickly scaled to handle multiple additional Centers and/or physicians. As we roll out our business model, we expect our administrative core and clinical model will assist us in maintaining economies of scale for all our localized integrated healthcare systems.
 
Referral and Partnering Relationships
 
Our business model leverages the direct contact and daily interaction that our physicians have with their patients, and emphasizes a patient-centric, shared clinical approach that also serves to address the needs of our various “partners,” including hospitals, third-party payors, referring physicians, our physicians and, most importantly, our patients. Our relationships with our partners are important to our continued success.
 
9


Hospitals
 
Our relationships with our hospital partners are critical to our operations. We work with our hospital partners to market our services to referring physicians, an important source of hospital admissions within the communities served by those hospitals. In addition, a majority of our physicians maintain regular hospital privileges, as well as trauma privileges where available, to ensure best in class healthcare is available to our patients and the community. The contracts we have with hospitals allow us to be responsible for billing patients and third-party payors for services rendered by our physicians separately from other related charges billed by the hospital or other physicians within the hospital to the same payors.
 
Third-Party Payors
 
Our relationships with government-sponsored plans, including Medicare and TRICARE, managed care organizations and commercial health insurance payors are vital to our business. We seek to maintain professional working relationships with our third-party payors, streamline the administrative process of billing and collection, and assist our patients and their families in understanding their health insurance coverage and any balances due for co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles or out-of-network benefit limitations. In addition, through our quality initiatives and continuing research and education efforts, we have sought to enhance clinical care provided to patients, which we believe benefits third-party payors by contributing to improved patient outcomes and reduced long-term health system costs.
 
We receive compensation for professional services provided by our physicians to patients based upon established rates for specific services provided, principally from third-party payors. Our billed charges are substantially the same for all parties in a particular geographic area, regardless of the party responsible for paying the bill for our services. Approximately one-third of our net patient service revenue is received from government-sponsored plans, principally Medicare and TRICARE programs.
 
Medicare is a health insurance program primarily for people 65 years of age and older, certain younger people with disabilities and people with end-stage renal disease. The program is provided without regard to income or assets and offers beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits. The most common option selected today by Medicare beneficiaries is the traditional fee-for-service payment system. Other options include managed care, preferred provider organizations, private fee-for-service and specialty plans. TRICARE is the healthcare program for U.S. military service members (active, Guard/Reserve and retired) and their families around the world. TRICARE is managed by the Defense Health Agency under leadership of the Assistant Secretary of Defense. Both Medicare and TRICARE compensation rates are generally lower in comparison to commercial health plans. In order to participate in government programs, our Medical Centers of Excellence must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements.
 
We also receive compensation pursuant to contracts with commercial payors offering a wide variety of health insurance products, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and exclusive provider organizations that are subject to various state laws and regulations, as well as self-insured organizations subject to federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) requirements. We seek to secure mutually agreeable contracts with payors that enable our physicians to be listed as in-network participants within the payors’ provider networks.
 
If we do not have a contractual relationship with a health insurance payor, we generally bill the payor our full billed charges. If payment is less than billed charges, we bill the balance to the patient, subject to state and federal laws regulating such billing. Although we maintain standard billing and collections procedures, we also provide discounts and/or payment option plans in certain hardship situations where patients and their families do not have the financial resources necessary to pay the amount due at the time services are rendered. Any amounts written-off related to private-pay patients are based on the specific facts and circumstances related to each individual patient account.
 
Referring Physicians and Practice Groups
 
Our relationships with our referring physicians and referring practice groups are critical to our success. Our physicians seek to establish and maintain long-term professional relationships with referring physicians in the communities where we practice. We believe that our community presence, through our hospital coverage and Medical Centers of Excellence, assists referring physicians with further enhancing their practices by providing well-coordinated and highly responsive care to their patients who require our musculoskeletal services, diagnostic services and rehabilitative care.
 
10


Government Regulation
 
The healthcare industry is governed by a framework of federal and state laws, rules and regulations that are extensive and complex and for which, in many cases, the industry has the benefit of only limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. If one of our physicians or physician practices is found to have violated these laws, rules or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010 contains numerous provisions that are reshaping the United States healthcare delivery system, and healthcare reform continues to attract significant legislative interest, regulatory activity, new approaches, legal challenges and public attention that create uncertainty and the potential for additional changes. Healthcare reform implementation, additional legislation or regulations, and other changes in government policy or regulation may affect our reimbursement, restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our Common Stock.
Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 
Existing federal laws governing Medicare, TRICARE and other federal healthcare programs (the “FHC Programs”), as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare companies like us. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and various state authorities.
 
The fraud and abuse laws include extensive federal and state regulations applicable to our financial relationships with hospitals, referring physicians and other healthcare entities. In particular, the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration in return for either referring Medicare, TRICARE or other FHC Program business, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending any service or item for which payment may be made by an FHC Program. In addition, federal physician self-referral legislation, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from ordering certain designated health services reimbursable by Medicare from an entity with which the physician has a prohibited financial relationship. These laws are broadly worded and, in the case of the anti-kickback statute, have been broadly interpreted by federal courts, and potentially subject many healthcare business arrangements to government investigation and prosecution, which can be costly and time consuming.
 
There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws authorizing the imposition of criminal, civil and administrative penalties for filing false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement with government healthcare programs. These laws include the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibits the submitting of or causing to be submitted false claims to the federal government or federal government programs, including Medicare, the TRICARE program for military dependents and retirees, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The FCA also applies to the improper retention of known over payments and includes “whistleblower” provisions that permit private citizens to sue a claimant on behalf of the government and thereby share in the amounts recovered under the law and to receive additional remedies. 
 
In addition, federal and state agencies that administer healthcare programs have at their disposal statutes, commonly known as “civil money penalty laws,” that authorize substantial administrative fines and exclusion from government programs in cases where an individual or company that filed a false claim, or caused a false claim to be filed, knew or should have known that the claim was false or fraudulent. As under the FCA, it often is not necessary for the agency to show that the claimant had actual knowledge that the claim was false or fraudulent in order to impose these penalties.
 
If we were excluded from any government-sponsored healthcare programs, not only would we be prohibited from submitting claims for reimbursement under such programs, but we also would be unable to contract with other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to provide services to them. It could also adversely affect our ability to contract with, or to obtain payment from, non-governmental payors.
 
11


Government Reimbursement Requirements
 
In order to participate in the Medicare program, we must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements. These programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue by increasing the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicare reimbursement for various services.
 
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 
Numerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of protected health information, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), and its implementing regulations, violations of which are punishable by monetary fines, civil penalties and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. As part of our medical record keeping, third-party billing, research and other services, we and our affiliated practices collect and maintain protected health information on the patients that we serve.
 
Health and Human Services Security Standards require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of individually identifiable health information that is electronically received, maintained or transmitted (including between us and our affiliated practices). We have implemented security policies, procedures and systems designed to facilitate compliance with the HIPAA Security Standards.
 
In February 2009, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”). Among other changes to the law governing protected health information, HITECH strengthens and expands HIPAA, increases penalties for violations, gives patients new rights to restrict uses and disclosures of their health information, and imposes a number of privacy and security requirements directly on our “Business Associates,” which are third-parties that perform functions or services for us or on our behalf. 
 
In addition to the federal HIPAA and HITECH requirements, numerous other state and certain other federal laws protect the confidentiality of patient information, including state medical privacy laws, state social security number protection laws, human subjects research laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. In some cases, state laws are more stringent than HIPAA and therefore, are not preempted by HIPAA.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our office-based operations are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Such compliance does not, and we anticipate that such compliance will not, materially affect our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations.
Compliance Program
 
We maintain a compliance program that reflects our commitment to complying with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business and that meets our ethical obligations in conducting our business (the “Compliance Program”). We believe our Compliance Program provides a solid framework to meet this commitment and our obligations as a provider of healthcare services, including:

● | a Compliance Committee consisting of our senior executives; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our Code of Ethics, which is applicable to our employees, officers and directors; 
● | a disclosure program that includes a mechanism to enable individuals to disclose on a confidential or anonymous basis to our Chief Executive Officer, or any person who is not in the disclosing individual’s chain of command, issues or questions believed by the individual to be a potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws; 
● | an organizational structure designed to integrate our compliance objectives into our corporate offices and Medical Centers of Excellence; and 
● | education, monitoring and corrective action programs, including a disclosure policy designed to establish methods to promote the understanding of our Compliance Program and adherence to its requirements. 

 
The foundation of our Compliance Program is our Code of Ethics which is intended to be a comprehensive statement of the ethical and legal standards governing the daily activities of our employees, affiliated professionals, independent contractors, officers and directors. All our personnel are required to abide by, and are given thorough education regarding, our Code of Ethics. In addition, all employees are expected to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of our Code of Ethics.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business including potential disputes with patients. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Our contracts with hospitals generally requires us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our physicians. Currently, we have no pending litigation that is deemed to be material.
 
Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Professional and General Liability Coverage
 
We maintain professional and general liability insurance policies with third-party insurers on a claims-made basis, subject to deductibles, self-insured retention limits, policy aggregates, exclusions, and other restrictions, in accordance with standard industry practice. We believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, we cannot assure that any pending or future claim will not be successful or if successful will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
