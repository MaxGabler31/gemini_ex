ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
General
We are a financial holding company, bank holding company and intermediate holding company whose principal subsidiaries are MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (MUB or the Bank) and MUSA. We are owned by MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG. MUFG Bank, Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MUFG. As used in this Form 10-K, terms such as "the Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to MUFG Americas Holdings Corporation (MUAH), one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to all of them together.
We provide a wide range of financial services to consumers, small businesses, middle-market companies and major corporations, both nationally and internationally. The Company also provides various business, banking, financial, administrative and support services, and facilities for MUFG Bank, Ltd. in connection with the operation and administration of MUFG Bank, Ltd.'s business in the U.S. (including MUFG Bank, Ltd.'s U.S. branches). The Bank and MUFG Bank, Ltd. are parties to a master services agreement whereby the Bank earns fee income in exchange for these services.
The Company has four reportable segments: Regional Bank, U.S. Wholesale & Investment Banking, Transaction Banking and MUSA. We service U.S. Wholesale & Investment Banking, certain Transaction Banking, and MUSA customers through the MUFG brand and serve Regional Bank and Transaction Banking customers through the Union Bank brand. The Company’s leadership team is bicoastal with Regional Bank and Transaction Banking leaders on the West Coast while U.S. Wholesale & Investment Banking and MUSA leaders are based in New York City. The corporate headquarters (principal executive office) for MUB, MUSA and MUAH is in New York City. MUB's main banking office is in San Francisco. The Company had consolidated assets of $168.1 billion at December 31, 2018.
On July 1, 2016, MUFG designated MUAH as its U.S. Intermediate Holding Company and transferred substantially all its U.S. subsidiaries to the IHC in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's final rules for Enhanced Prudential Standards. MUFG's remaining U.S. subsidiaries were transferred to MUAH on July 1, 2017. The remaining subsidiaries transferred have been included in MUAH's financial results on a prospective basis. The Company issued 11,258,882 shares to MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG in exchange for the transferred subsidiaries. For additional information regarding related party transactions, refer to Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
All reports that we file or furnish electronically with the SEC, including the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to those reports, are accessible at no cost at www.unionbank.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. These filings are also accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Lines of Business
Our operations are organized into four reportable segments: Regional Bank, U.S. Wholesale & Investment Banking, Transaction Banking and MUFG Securities Americas. These segments and their financial information are described more fully in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 13,250 full-time equivalent employees.

Competition 
Banking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business both nationally and internationally. Our competitors include a large number of state and national banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banks and major foreign-affiliated or foreign banks, as well as many financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those offered by us, including many large securities firms, financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies and marketplace lenders. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory restraints and some may have lower cost structures. Some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions, while others include large financial institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources. 
The financial services industry is also becoming more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically and may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries.
Current federal law has made it easier for out-of-state banks to enter and compete in the states in which we operate. Competition in our principal markets may further intensify as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act which, among other things, permits out-of-state de novo branching by national banks, state banks, and foreign banks from other states. 
The primary factors in competing for business include pricing, convenience of office locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, customer relationships, and level of services offered.
Supervision and Regulation
BHCs, banks and securities broker-dealers are extensively regulated under federal and state law. This regulation is intended primarily for the safety and soundness of banks, the protection of bank depositors, brokerage and other customers, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the Securities Investors Protection Fund and the U.S. banking and financial services system as a whole, and not for the benefit of investors in securities issued by a BHC or bank. Set forth below is a summary description of significant laws and regulations and other legal authorities that relate to our operations and those of our subsidiaries, including MUB and MUSA. This summary description of applicable legal authorities is not complete and is qualified by reference to such legal authorities and does not address every legal authority. Financial statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted, implemented or applied in a specific instance, could have a material effect on our business and operations.
Principal Federal Banking Laws
BHCA and the GLBA. The Company, MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. are subject to regulation under the BHCA, which subjects us to Federal Reserve reporting, supervision and examination and other requirements. Generally, the BHCA restricts our ability to invest in non-banking entities, and we may not acquire more than five percent of the voting shares of any domestic bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Our activities are limited, with some exceptions, to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve deems to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.
The GLBA allows “financial holding companies” to offer banking, insurance, securities and other financial products. Among other things, the GLBA provides a framework for BHCs to engage in new financial activities under certain conditions. MUAH, MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG are financial holding companies under the BHCA. A financial holding company is authorized to engage in activities beyond those permissible for a BHC that are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as well as certain specified non-banking activities deemed to be closely related to banking. In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, a BHC must continue to meet certain standards established by the Federal Reserve. Those standards require that a financial holding company exceed the minimum standards applicable to BHCs that have not elected to become financial holding companies. These higher standards include meeting the “well capitalized” and “well managed” standards for financial holding companies as defined in the regulations of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit the ability of a financial holding company (or any of its affiliates) to 
8

conduct otherwise permissible activities if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet these standards. If the deficiencies are not corrected, the Federal Reserve may require that the financial holding company either terminate any activity that is not permissible for a BHC or divest control of a deficient depository institution subsidiary.  Failure to comply can also result in the assessment of civil money penalties against the financial holding company. In addition, a financial holding company must ensure that its U.S. banking subsidiaries meet certain minimum standards under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
National Bank Act. MUB, our principal U.S. banking subsidiary, is chartered under and subject to the National Bank Act which, together with the regulations of the OCC, governs many aspects of the corporate activities and banking operations of national banks, including the powers and duties of national banks, the payment of dividends on capital stock, conduct of loan, investment and fiduciary activities, minimum capital ratios, the opening and closing of branches, the acquisition of other banking entities or financial companies and many other matters.
Principal Federal Banking Regulatory Agencies
Federal Reserve. As a BHC and financial holding company, we are subject to the extensive regulation, supervision and examination authority of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over all BHCs. Such authority includes the power to assess civil monetary penalties against any BHC violating any provision of the BHCA or any regulation or order of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. The Federal Reserve also has the power to order termination of activities or ownership of non-bank subsidiaries of the holding company if it determines there is reasonable cause to believe that the activities or ownership of the non-bank subsidiaries constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of banks owned by the BHC. Willful violations of the BHCA or regulations or orders of the Federal Reserve can also result in criminal penalties for the BHC and any individuals participating in such conduct.
Comptroller of the Currency. MUB, as a national banking association, is subject to broad regulation and oversight of all its operations by the OCC, its primary federal banking regulator, and also by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. MUB is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to ongoing supervision and examination by the OCC.
The OCC has extensive enforcement authority over national banks. If, during an examination of a bank or otherwise, the OCC determines that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, or other aspects of the bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any laws or regulations, various remedies are available to the OCC, including the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced to increase capital, to restrict the growth of the bank, to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors and/or ultimately to terminate the bank’s charter. The OCC also has broad authority to address bank activity it deems to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
The OCC has adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for large national banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as MUB. The guidelines establish specific risk management-related roles and responsibilities for three designated functions: a bank’s “front line” public-facing business; independent risk management; and internal audit.
The OCC has also provided additional guidance to national banks for assessing and managing risks associated with third-party relationships, including any business relationship between a bank and another entity, by contract or otherwise. The guidance includes regulatory expectations for planning, due diligence, third-party selection, contract negotiation and ongoing monitoring of third-party relationships that banks should consider when outsourcing bank functions. The guidance could have an impact on MUB’s selection of vendors to which it outsources certain functions and on MUB’s contract negotiations, particularly with respect to representations and warranties and indemnification by the vendors it may select.

In November 2017, MUFG Bank, Ltd. applied to the OCC to convert its state-licensed branches and agencies in the U.S. to federal branches and agencies; the OCC approved the conversion applications and issued federal licenses to such branches and agencies in November 2017.  For additional information, see “MUFG Bank, Ltd.'s and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s credit ratings and financial or regulatory condition could adversely affect our operations” in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Report on Form 10-K.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB has direct supervision and examination authority over banks with more than $10 billion in assets, including MUB. The CFPB’s responsibilities include implementing and enforcing federal consumer financial protection laws, reviewing the business practices of financial services providers for legal compliance, monitoring the marketplace for transparency on behalf of consumers and responding to complaints and questions from consumers about consumer financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act added prohibitions on unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the CFPB. In various public pronouncements and enforcement actions, the CFPB has focused on a variety of practices it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, including the following: credit-card add-on products, including billing of consumers for credit-monitoring services without prior consent; failing to accept or timely post payments; failure to honor loan modifications after the loan servicing is transferred; various debt collection practices, including sending foreclosure notices to borrowers who were current on their loans; and various practices relating to debts owed by service members, such as threatening to contact the members’ commanding officers about loan arrears or burying the contractual authorization for this practice in the lending contract. The CFPB has also focused on automobile dealer discretionary interest rate markups and on holding banks and other purchasers of such contracts responsible for unlawful disparities in markups charged by dealers to borrowers of different races or ethnicities. The CFPB also has finalized rules that impact many aspects of residential mortgage loans and lending practices, including a requirement that banks develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a borrower’s “reasonable ability to repay” test, make new or revised disclosures and revise policies and procedures for originating and servicing residential mortgage loans. Various pronouncements from recently appointed and other CFPB officers and recent CFPB actions have suggested it is undertaking a review of, and changes to, its past methods and practices, which could give rise to additional operational, regulatory and other risks.
Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, heads of the federal banking regulatory agencies and the SEC, and certain other officials) provides oversight of all risks created within the U.S. economy from the activities of financial services companies and supports enhanced prudential regulation. It also has the authority to recommend stricter standards for the largest, most interconnected financial services and other firms. Where it determines that certain practices or activities pose a threat to financial stability, it may make recommendations to the primary financial regulatory agencies for new or heightened regulatory standards. The Financial Stability Oversight Council must determine which BHCs and non-bank financial companies pose risks to U.S. financial stability, and subject those companies to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. BHCs over $50 billion in consolidated assets are considered to be “large interconnected bank holding companies” and automatically designated as “systemically significant.” The Company falls within this category, and therefore, is subject to heightened prudential standards including enhanced capital, leverage, and liquidity standards, as well as credit exposure reporting, concentration limits, stress testing and resolution plan requirements.
Dodd-Frank Act and Related Regulations
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, has resulted in sweeping changes to the U.S. financial system. Many provisions of the law have been implemented by rules and regulations of the federal banking agencies but, as discussed below, certain provisions of the law are yet to be implemented and therefore the full scope and impact of the law on banking institutions generally, and specifically on our business cannot, be fully determined at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides authority to the FDIC to serve as receiver in the liquidation of systemically important non-bank financial companies, including BHCs. Liquidation proceedings for such companies will be funded by borrowings from the U.S. Treasury and risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. In circumstances where there is a shortfall after assessments on creditors of a failed company, there may be assessments on BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as the Company.
President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”), which amended various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as other federal banking 
10

statutes on May 24, 2018. Among other things, the EGRRCPA raised the threshold for designation as a systemically important financial institution from $50 billion to $250 billion in assets, removed BHCs with less than $100 billion in assets from the application of enhanced prudential standards and eliminated the applicability of enhanced prudential standards to BHCs with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets 18 months after enactment unless the Federal Reserve by order or rule determines to apply enhanced prudential standards to any such institution. The Federal Reserve is authorized to establish by order or rule tailored enhanced prudential standards, including periodic stress tests and liquidity requirements, for BHCs with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets and is required to tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to BHCs of any size based on certain factors, including capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size and other risk-related factors that the Federal Reserve deems appropriate. With respect to foreign banking organizations (“FBOs”), the EGRRCPA states it does not affect the continued applicability of enhanced prudential standards to FBOs with global assets equal to or greater than $100 billion or limit the authority of the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards requirements with respect to, or tailor the regulation of, an FBO with total assets equal to or greater than $100 billion, including the requirement that it establish an IHC. Because MUFG, as an FBO, has total assets in excess of $100 billion, the Company expects that it will remain subject to the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards rules even though various domestic BHCs with a size comparable to MUAH will be relieved from compliance with such rules.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules regarding stress testing requirements for large BHCs such as the Company. The OCC also adopted similar rules for large national banks such as MUB. The stress testing rules govern the timing and type of stress testing activities required of large BHCs and banks as well as rules governing testing controls, oversight and disclosure requirements. The stress testing rules limit the ability of a BHC to make capital distributions to the extent that its actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan, measured on a quarterly basis.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted final rules regarding enhanced prudential standards for both large U.S. BHCs, such as the Company, and FBOs operating in the U.S., such as MUFG Bank, Ltd. These integrated rules include the Federal Reserve’s resolution plan, capital plan and stress testing rules, as well as a final rule regarding enhanced prudential standards. (The resolution, capital plan and stress testing rules are discussed below in this section.) The final enhanced prudential standards rule addresses a diverse array of regulatory subjects, each of which is highly complex. In some instances, the rule implements new financial regulatory requirements and in other instances it overlaps other regulatory reforms already in existence (such as the Basel III capital and liquidity reforms and stress testing requirements discussed elsewhere in this report). For large domestic BHCs, such as the Company, and FBO’s operating in the U.S., such as MUFG Bank, Ltd., the final enhanced prudential standards rule formalizes governance and oversight processes with respect to various prudential standards already in place through the Federal Reserve’s other rule-makings, as described in this section, but also imposed certain additional requirements such as an internal liquidity stress testing regime (intended to be complementary to the Federal Reserve’s liquidity coverage ratio proposal discussed below) and maintenance of a related liquidity buffer.
In March 2016, the Federal Reserve re-proposed its single counterparty credit limit rule. The re-proposed rule would impose a general limit on the credit exposure to an unaffiliated counterparty of a U.S. or foreign bank holding company with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and any IHC to a maximum of 25% of such company's total capital. A stricter credit exposure limit of 25% of Tier 1 Capital is applied to such a company which has $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. The strictest restrictions would apply to such a BHC which is classified as a globally systemic important banking organization. For such companies, a credit exposure limit to unaffiliated major counterparties (with assets of $500 billion or more) of 15% of Tier 1 Capital would be applied in addition to application of an aggregate net credit exposure limit to other counterparties of 25% of Tier 1 capital.
The final enhanced prudential standards rules relating to FBOs are similar in various respects to those adopted for large domestic BHCs, such as enhanced requirements relating to risk management, including liquidity risk management and capital adequacy and liquidity stress testing. However, the final FBO rules differ in various respects from the domestic BHC rules. For example, a large FBO must certify to the Federal Reserve that it meets capital adequacy standards established by its home country supervisor that are consistent with the BCBS framework. If the FBO does not satisfy such requirements, the Federal Reserve may impose requirements, conditions or restrictions on its U.S. activities.
11

In addition, the final FBO rules require that an FBO with $50 billion or more of non-branch assets in the U.S. (such as MUFG Bank, Ltd.) operate in the U.S. through an IHC structure. The FBO is required to hold its interest in any U.S. subsidiary through the IHC, which will be its top-tier U.S. subsidiary. U.S. branches of FBOs, such as those of MUFG Bank, Ltd., are excluded from this requirement. The final FBO standards had a July 1, 2016 initial compliance date and generally deferred application of a specified IHC leverage ratio until 2018. MUAH became the IHC for the U.S. operations of MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. on July 1, 2016.
Additionally, in December 2016, the Federal Reserve finalized rules imposing new TLAC requirements on GSIBs with operations in the U.S., such as MUFG. The Company, which serves as MUFG’s designated IHC in the U.S., will be required to maintain a minimum amount of total loss-absorbing capacity, which must be met with a combination of Tier 1 regulatory capital and long-term debt. Due to MUFG’s single point of entry resolution approach, the Company will be subject to a minimum level of internal TLAC, which must be issued either to a foreign company that controls the Company (in this case MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG) or to another directly or indirectly wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of MUFG. TLAC Tier 1 regulatory capital is intended to absorb ongoing losses, while the conversion of TLAC eligible long-term debt into common equity is intended to recapitalize the Company prior to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Company became subject to these new rules on January 1, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company restructured existing debt issued to MUFG Bank, Ltd. and replaced a portion of its externally-placed debt with the issuance of internal TLAC-eligible debt issued to MUFG Bank, Ltd. in order to comply with the new rules.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve regulations, a BHC is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under these requirements, a BHC may be required to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. However, this additional capital may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide such support, or may not be inclined to provide such support under the then existing circumstances. 
The federal financial regulatory agencies adopted final rules implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule. The final rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and associated options for their own account. The final rule provides exemptions for certain activities, including certain types of market making, underwriting, hedging of specific, identifiable risks of individual or aggregated positions and trading in U.S. government, agency, state and municipal obligations. These exemptions are limited if they involve a material conflict of interest, a material exposure to high-risk assets or trading strategies or a threat to the institution’s safety and soundness or to that of the U.S. financial system. The rules also exempt trading for customers in a fiduciary capacity or in riskless principal trades, subject to certain requirements.
The Volcker Rule also prohibits banking entities from owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds (covered funds), subject to certain exclusions. MUB sold the vast majority of its non-conforming private equity fund interests after the Volcker Rule was proposed.
The Volcker Rule also provides compliance requirements generally requiring banking entities to establish an internal compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the final rules. As a larger banking entity, the Company was required to establish a more detailed compliance program.
Although we have incurred increased compliance costs as a result of the Volcker Rule, we do not anticipate a material adverse impact to our financial results as revenue from prohibited proprietary trading and covered fund investment activities does not contribute significantly to our financial results.
The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the existing standard for the federal preemption of state consumer financial laws to allow a court or the OCC to preempt a state consumer financial law only if it discriminates against national banks, prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by the national bank of its powers or the state law is preempted by another federal law. This change was intended to allow greater regulation of national banks under state law and may result in increased consumer protection requirements being imposed on national banks. The Dodd-Frank Act also eliminated the extension of federal preemption under the National Bank Act to operating subsidiaries of national banks negating certain OCC regulations and court decisions. The Act also authorized state law enforcement authorities to bring lawsuits under state law against national banks, thus 
12

subjecting national banks to varying and potentially conflicting interpretation of law by state attorneys general and state agencies. This could result in increased compliance costs for national banks. The Act also required the OCC to make preemption determinations on particular state consumer financial laws on a case-by-case basis, rather than making preemption determinations on broad categories of laws.
Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Standards
The federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted risk-based capital standards under which a banking organization’s capital is compared to the risks associated with assets reflected on its balance sheet as well as its off-balance sheet exposures, such as letters of credit.
Regulatory Capital Rules. The Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies have adopted final rules to implement the Basel III capitalization rules of the BCBS for banking organizations located in the United States (U.S. Basel III Rules). The U.S. Basel III Rules replace the U.S. federal banking agencies’ general risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches rule, market-risk rule, and leverage rules, in accordance with certain transition provisions. In December 2014, MUAH received approval from the Federal Reserve to opt-out of the advanced approaches rules for holding companies. MUAH became subject to the U.S. Basel III Rules on January 1, 2015, with certain provisions subject to a phase-in period. MUB previously opted-in to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, and therefore was required to comply with the U.S. Basel III Rules beginning on January 1, 2014. However, effective September 30, 2017, the OCC approved MUB's request to opt-out of the U.S. Basel III Rules advanced approaches, including MUB's one-time permanent election to exclude certain components of AOCI from its regulatory capital calculations. The U.S. Basel III Rules generally establish more restrictive capital definitions, create additional categories and higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes and off-balance sheet exposures, and higher leverage ratios and capital conservation buffers that are added to the minimum capital requirements and must be satisfied for banking organizations to avoid becoming subject to certain limitations on dividends and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The U.S. Basel III Rules also implement higher minimum capital requirements.
The U.S. Basel III Rules also provide for various adjustments and deductions to the definitions of regulatory capital that became fully effective on December 31, 2017. Under these rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements (equal to 2.50% of its total risk-weighted assets). The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at the 0.625% level and is being implemented on a phased-in basis over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached the 2.5% standard on January 1, 2019).
In January 2014, the BCBS issued an updated version of its leverage ratio and disclosure guidance (the “Basel III leverage ratio”). The BCBS guidance continues to set a minimum Basel III leverage ratio of 3%. In April 2016, the BCBS proposed, among other things, that for purposes of calculating the denominator of the leverage ratio, off-balance sheet exposures of banks to securitization transactions should be treated the same as such exposures are treated under the BCBS revisions to its securitization framework for risk-based capital. The BCBS further amended the leverage ratio, among other revisions to its Basel III capital framework, in December 2017 (“Basel IV”). The Basel IV revisions refine the definition of the leverage ratio “exposure measure” (the Basel III term for total non-risk-weighted assets), and introduce a leverage ratio buffer applicable to GSIBs, requiring GSIBs to maintain a higher leverage ratio. Beginning January 1, 2022, the updates to the leverage ratio will be implemented and the BCBS leverage ratio buffer will apply to GSIBs. 
Prompt Corrective Action. Under the OCC’s prompt corrective action regulations (established pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), a bank is assigned to one of five capital categories ranging from “well-capitalized” to “critically under- capitalized.” Institutions that are “under-capitalized” or lower are subject to increasingly more restrictive mandatory supervisory corrective actions. At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations. Failure to meet regulatory capital guidelines can result in a bank being required to raise additional capital. An “under-capitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must generally guarantee the bank’s compliance 
13

with the plan. The OCC has amended its prompt corrective action regulations to reflect the changes made to the regulatory capital requirements by the U.S. Basel III Rules.
For additional information regarding the regulatory capital positions of MUAH and MUB, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this Report on Form 10-K and Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report on Form 10-K.
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review Program. MUAH is subject to regulatory requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan which must be reviewed and approved by its Board of Directors (or designated subcommittee thereof); however, MUAH was granted regulatory administrative relief in 2019 and is not required to submit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve or participate in the 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR 2019) process.  The Company remains subject to future cycles of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program.  CCAR evaluates capital planning processes and assesses capital adequacy levels under various scenarios to determine if BHCs would have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress.  Depending on the circumstances, failure to attain a non-objection of a BHC’s CCAR plan from the Federal Reserve could have a variety of adverse consequences for the institution, including a requirement to augment capital, restrain growth or other adverse consequences.  The Federal Reserve’s capital plan and stress testing rules for bank holding companies provide that the Federal Reserve may not object to a capital plan on the basis of qualitative deficiencies in the BHC’s capital planning process if the BHC has total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion, nonbank assets of less than $75 billion and is not controlling a U.S. global systemically important bank (large but noncomplex firms).  Under these rules, such bank holding companies’ capital planning processes will be evaluated during the Federal Reserve’s regular ongoing supervisory activities. 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio. The U.S. banking agencies adopted a rule implementing a standardized quantitative liquidity requirement generally consistent with the LCR standard, which was included in the Basel III framework of the BCBS. This LCR rule is designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and HQLA, such as central bank reserves and government and corporate debt, to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using specified liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions (that produce net cash outflow). An institution’s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as defined and calculated in accordance with the reductions and limitations in the rules, divided by its net cash outflow, with the quotient expressed as a percentage. While the LCR standard generally applies to all internationally active banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures, the rule also applies a less stringent, modified LCR to BHCs that are not internationally active, and have more than $50 billion in total assets (such as the Company). Under the LCR rule, financial institutions must maintain an LCR equal to at least 100% based on the entity’s total projected net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days, effectively using net cash outflow assumptions equal to 70% of the outflow assumptions prescribed for internationally active banking organizations. The Company is in compliance with the requirements of the modified LCR standard. Under the LCR rule, commencing in 2019, the Company and other bank holding companies subject to the rule will be required to make periodic public disclosure on their websites of quantitative and qualitative aspects of their LCR within 60 days after calendar year-end (45 days for quarterly filings).
Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Banks
There are additional requirements and restrictions in the laws of the U.S. and states in which MUB and its subsidiaries conduct operations. The consumer lending and other banking activities of MUB are subject to extensive regulation under various state laws as well as the federal laws discussed above. Furthermore, due to MUFG Bank, Ltd.’s controlling ownership of the Company, regulatory requirements adopted or enforced by the Government of Japan may have an impact on the activities and investments of the Company in the future.
Deposit Insurance. Customer deposits maintained by MUB are insured up to statutory limits (currently $250,000 per depositor, subject to certain exceptions) by the FDIC and, accordingly, are subject to deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and can be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole.

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted a comprehensive, long-range restoration plan for the deposit insurance fund to increase the fund’s reserves relative to total insured deposits in the U.S. The ultimate effect on our business of legislative, regulatory and economic developments on the deposit insurance fund cannot be predicted with certainty.
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured depositors and the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, in order of priority of payment.
If any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the FDIC is appointed its conservator or receiver, the FDIC may, in most cases, disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs. In addition, the FDIC as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision providing for termination, default, acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution, appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution, or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution.
Under provisions of the FDIA, an FDIC-insured bank under common control with another FDIC-insured bank is generally liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC upon the actual or reasonably likely failure of such other bank. Thus, MUB could incur liability to the FDIC under these provisions in the event of failure of another bank controlled by the Company or MUFG. This liability would be subordinated to deposit liabilities and certain other senior liabilities. At present, neither the Company nor MUFG have such other bank subsidiaries.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations, BHCs and insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in assets are required to develop and annually file with the bank regulators resolution plans or so-called “living wills” to facilitate the FDIC’s ability to liquidate such banks in a prompt and orderly fashion upon a failure. If the bank regulators determine that the resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate the orderly resolution of the institution, they may require the institution to submit a revised resolution plan that addresses the deficiencies identified by the regulators. If the regulators determine that the revised plan remains deficient, they may decide to subject the institution to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations and may impose other sanctions.
In September of 2016, the OCC adopted guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by national banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as MUB. The guidelines require such larger banks to undertake recovery planning to be able to respond quickly to and recover from the financial effects of severe stress on the bank. The recovery plan should identify triggers that reflect the bank’s particular vulnerabilities and identify a wide range of credible options that the bank could undertake to preserve or restore financial strength and viability and provide that the bank will notify the OCC of any significant breach of a trigger and actions taken or to be taken in response. Banks with total assets of more than $100 billion but less than $750 billion, such as MUB, were required to comply with these new requirements on or before January 1, 2018. MUB is in compliance with these requirements. The OCC is empowered to order enforcement of the guidelines and may assess civil money penalties against and require other actions of banks which fail to meet these standards.
Community Reinvestment Act. MUB is subject to the CRA. The CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the needs of local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and the CRA into account when regulating and supervising other activities and in evaluating whether to approve applications for permission to engage in new activities or to acquire other banks or companies or de novo branching. An unsatisfactory CRA rating may be the basis for denying the application.

Fair Lending and Other Related Laws. MUB is subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and the implementing regulations thereunder. The statute requires financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of credit to make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction: (1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); (2) because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program; or (3) because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. In addition, a creditor may not make any oral or written statement, in advertising or otherwise, to customers or prospective customers that would discourage on a prohibited basis, an application for credit.
MUB is also subject to the Federal Housing Act, which makes discrimination in home lending illegal, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires banks to reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities. 
Banks are periodically examined for compliance with these fair lending laws and other related laws. The banking regulators are required to refer matters relating to these fair lending laws to the Department of Justice for possible investigation and further appropriate action under civil penalty statutes whenever the regulator has reason to believe that a creditor has engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that may violate these laws.
Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The banking industry is subject to extensive regulatory controls and processes under the Bank Secrecy Act and related anti-money laundering laws. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, federal banking regulators must consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering program prior to approving an application for a merger, acquisition or other activities requiring regulatory approval. The U.S. also imposes economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These rules are administered by OFAC. Included among OFAC restrictions are limitations or prohibitions on engaging in financial transactions involving a sanctioned country, entity or person and prohibitions on transfers of blocked property and bank deposits subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these requirements may adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals for future initiatives requiring regulatory approval, including acquisitions and additionally could result in substantial monetary fines, penalties and other sanctions.
Affiliate Transactions. MUB and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and related regulations, including restrictions on loans by MUB to, and other transactions with, its affiliates (including requirements that such transactions with MUB be collateralized and on arm’s-length terms). Dividends payable by MUB to MUAH are subject to restrictions under a formula imposed by the OCC unless express approval is given by the OCC to exceed these limitations.
Customer Information Security. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The guidelines require each financial institution to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. MUB has adopted a customer information security program. In addition, each agency has published its standards and expectations for banks to protect their own data, information technology and other assets and operations from unauthorized intrusion and vulnerability to malicious cyber-attack to the greatest degree possible.
Privacy. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banks’ policies and procedures and applicable law. MUB implemented its privacy policy, which provides that all of its existing and new customers will be notified of MUB’s privacy policies. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which increased the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among affiliated companies for the purpose of cross-marketing products and services between those 
16

affiliated companies. Certain state laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy and security of customer information also apply to us and our other subsidiaries.
Overdraft and Interchange Fees; Interest on Demand Deposits. Regulation E restricts a bank's ability to charge overdraft services and fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to an overdraft service for those types of transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act's "Durbin Amendment" also required the Federal Reserve to establish standards for interchange fees that are “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing the debit card transaction and imposes other requirements on card networks.
Regulation of MUSA
MUSA is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). MUSA is also registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) as a broker-dealer. MUSA was previously a Futures Commission Merchant and a member of the National Futures Association. However, it effectively deregistered in 2017.
Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations such as the FINRA of which MUSA is a member. The principal purpose of regulating broker-dealers is the protection of clients and the securities markets. The regulations cover many aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
MUSA is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule), Rule 15c3-3 (Customer Protection) and related SRO requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. The Customer Protection Rule provides requirements for customer cash reserves and the custody of customer securities.
The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits a broker-dealer subsidiary from paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or repaying subordinated loans to its parent company if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $1,000,000.
In addition to the net capital requirements as a self-clearing broker-dealer, MUSA is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Options Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility.
Future Legislation or Regulatory Initiatives
The economic and political environment of the past several years has led to a number of proposed legislative, governmental and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state levels, certain of which are described above, that may significantly impact our industry. These and other initiatives could significantly change the competitive and operating environment in which we and our subsidiaries operate. We cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact of any such initiatives on our operations, competitive situation, financial condition or results of operations.
In October 2018, the Federal Reserve invited comments on a framework that would more closely match regulations for large banking organizations with their risk profiles. Firms in the lowest risk category - generally most domestic firms with assets of between $100 billion and $250 billion would no longer be subject to standardized liquidity requirements but would be subject to firm-developed liquidity tests and reduced stress testing requirements. Firms with $250 billion or more in assets that are not GSIBs would be subject to reduced standardized liquidity requirements depending on their risk profile and would be subject to stress testing but on an extended cycle. Under the Federal Reserve’s proposal, GSIBs, such as MUFG, would not see any change in their capital or liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve advised that it expects to issue a separate tailoring 
17

proposal for foreign banks in the future. Whether and to what extent, MUAH and MUB may be affected by these initiatives cannot be predicted at this time.
Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
We are disclosing the following information pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), which requires an issuer to disclose whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with natural persons or entities designated by the U.S. government under specified Executive Orders. The scope of activities that must be reported includes activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the United States in compliance with applicable local law. Because we are indirectly wholly-owned by MUFG, a Japanese corporation, our disclosure includes activities, transactions or dealings conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates of MUFG which are not controlled by us. We have requested that MUFG provide us a description of reportable activity under Section 13(r) and have received the following information: 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, a non-U.S. subsidiary of MUFG engaged in business activities with entities in, or affiliated with, Iran, including counterparties owned or controlled by the Iranian government. Specifically, MUFG’s non-U.S. banking subsidiary, MUFG Bank, Ltd., issued letters of credit and guarantees and provided remittance and other settlement services mainly in connection with customer transactions related to the purchase and exportation of Iranian crude oil to Japan, and in some cases, in connection with other petroleum-related transactions with Iran by its customers. These transactions did not involve U.S. dollars nor clearing services of U.S. banks for the settlement of payments. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the aggregate interest and fee income relating to these transactions was less than ¥100 million, representing less than 0.005 percent of MUFG’s total interest and fee income. Some of these transactions were conducted through the use of non-U.S. dollar correspondent accounts and other similar settlement accounts maintained with MUFG Bank, Ltd. outside the United States by Iranian financial institutions and other entities in, or affiliated with, Iran. In addition to such accounts, MUFG Bank, Ltd. receives deposits in Japan from, and provides settlement services in Japan to, fewer than 10 Iranian government-related entities and fewer than 100 Iranian government-related individuals such as Iranian diplomats, and maintains settlement accounts outside the United States for certain other financial institutions specified in Executive Order 13382, which settlement accounts were frozen in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the average aggregate balance of deposits held in these accounts represented less than 0.1 percent of the average balance of MUFG’s total deposits. The fee income from the transactions attributable to these account holders was less than ¥18 million, representing less than 0.005 percent of MUFG’s total fee income. Although there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2018, MUFG Bank, Ltd. had, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, loans that were arranged prior to changes in applicable laws and regulations to borrowers in, or affiliated with, Iran, including entities owned by the Iranian government. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the agent fee income relating to these loan transactions was less than ¥20 million, representing less than 0.005 percent of MUFG’s total interest and fee income. 
We understand that MUFG Bank, Ltd. recognizes that following the withdrawal in May 2018 by the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the United States has imposed secondary sanctions against non-U.S. persons who engage in or facilitate a broad range of transactions and activities involving Iran. We understand that MUFG Bank, Ltd. will take the recent sanctions related developments into account and monitor any future transactions relating to Iran in order to comply with applicable U.S. and Japanese regulations as well as U.S., Japanese and other international sanctions.
