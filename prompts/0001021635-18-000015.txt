Item 1. Business.
THE COMPANY

Introduction

The Company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central U.S. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and it lacks the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance.   The Company was incorporated in August 1995 in the State of Oklahoma and its principal executive offices are located at 321 North Harvey, P.O. Box 321, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73101-0321; telephone 405-553-3000.

The electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.  OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. 
The natural gas midstream operations segment represents the Company's investment in Enable through wholly owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. Enable is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. Enable also owns an emerging crude oil gathering business in the Bakken Shale formation, principally located in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois.
Enable was formed effective May 1, 2013 by the Company, the ArcLight group and CenterPoint to own and operate the midstream businesses of the Company and CenterPoint. In the formation transaction, the Company and the ArcLight group contributed Enogex LLC to Enable, and the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired an equity interest in Enable. The Company determined that its contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable met the requirements of being in substance real estate and was recorded at historical cost. The general partner of Enable is equally controlled by the Company and CenterPoint, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, the Company began accounting for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting.
In April 2014, Enable completed an initial public offering of 25.0 million common units resulting in Enable becoming a publicly traded Master Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2017, the Company owned 111.0 million common units, or 25.7 percent, of Enable's outstanding common units. For additional information on the Company's equity investment in Enable and related party transactions, see Note 3 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Over the past three years, Enable has seen changes in producer activity due to the volatility of commodity prices. In early 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. During 2016 and 2017, those prices increased, and have stabilized, but have not rebounded to the pre-2015 levels. If commodity prices decline further, Enable's future operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted. A portion of our earnings and operating cash flows depend on the performance of, and distributions from, Enable. As disclosed in this Form 10-K, Enable is subject to a number of risks. If any of those risks were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

On February 9, 2018, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.31800 per unit on its outstanding common units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. If cash distributions to Enable’s unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. The Company is entitled to 60 percent of those "incentive distributions."

Company Strategy

The Company's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customer's needs for energy and related services, focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.
OG&E is focused on:

• | providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity;


• | providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve, with a particular focus on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments;


• | having strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members;


• | continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results;


• | complying with the EPA's Regional Haze Rule requirements;


• | ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers; and


• | continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill.

Additionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of three to five percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities.  The Company also utilizes cash distributions from its investment in Enable to help fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and having strong regulatory and legislative relationships.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS - OG&E
General
The electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E. OG&E furnishes retail electric service in 267 communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas. The service area covers 30,000 square miles in Oklahoma and western Arkansas, including Oklahoma City, the largest city in Oklahoma, and Fort Smith, Arkansas, the second largest city in that state. Of the 267 communities that OG&E serves, 241 are located in Oklahoma, and 26 are in Arkansas. OG&E derived 91 percent of its total electric operating revenues in 2017 from sales in Oklahoma and the remainder from sales in Arkansas.  OG&E does not currently serve wholesale customers in either state.
OG&E's system control area peak demand in 2017 was 6,456 MWs on July 21, 2017. OG&E's load responsibility peak demand was 5,752 MWs on July 21, 2017. The following table shows system sales and variations in system sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Year Ended December 31 | 2017 | 2017 vs. 2016 | 2016 | 2016 vs. 2015 | 2015
System sales - (Millions of MWh) | 26.3 | (2.2)% | 26.9 | (1.1)% | 27.2

OG&E is subject to competition in various degrees from government-owned electric systems, municipally-owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from other private utilities, power marketers and cogenerators as well 
 3

as from consumers choosing appliances powered by other energy sources. Oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity.
Besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity, OG&E competes with suppliers of other forms of energy. The degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy. It is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production. Our ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinate of our competitiveness.

Regulation and Rates
OG&E's retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas.  The issuance of certain securities by OG&E is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC.  OG&E's transmission activities, short-term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.  The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OG&E's facilities and operations.  In 2017, 85 percent of OG&E's electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, eight percent to the APSC and seven percent to the FERC.
The OCC issued an order in 1996 authorizing OG&E to reorganize into a subsidiary of the Company.  The order required that, among other things, (i) the Company permit the OCC access to the books and records of the Company and its affiliates relating to transactions with OG&E, (ii) the Company employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non-utility activities by OG&E's customers and (iii) the Company refrain from pledging OG&E assets or income for affiliate transactions.  In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which in turn granted to the FERC access to the books and records of the Company and its affiliates as the FERC deems relevant to costs incurred by OG&E or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers with respect to the FERC jurisdictional rates.
Completed Regulatory Matters
Arkansas Rate Case Filing 
On August 25, 2016, OG&E filed a general rate case with the APSC. The rate filing requested a $16.5 million rate increase based on a 10.25 percent return on equity. The requested rate increase was based on a June 30, 2016 test year and included recovery of over $3.0 billion of electric infrastructure additions since the last Arkansas general rate case in 2011. The requested increase also reflected increases in operation and maintenance expenses, including vegetation management and increased recovery of depreciation and dismantlement costs.
In May 2017, the APSC approved a settlement between OG&E and the staff of the APSC and other intervenors. The settlement provided for a $7.1 million annual rate increase and a 9.5 percent return on equity on a 50.0 percent equity capital structure. 
The settlement also provided that OG&E will be regulated under a formula rate rider, which should result in a more efficient process as the return on equity, depreciation rates and capital structure should not change from what was approved by the APSC in this settlement. OG&E expects to make its first filing under the Arkansas Formula Rate Rider in October 2018.
Fuel Adjustment Clause Review for Calendar Year 2015
On September 8, 2016, the OCC staff filed an application to review OG&E’s fuel adjustment clause for calendar year 2015, including the prudence of OG&E’s electric generation, purchased power and fuel procurement costs. On October 12, 2017, the OCC issued an order finding that, for the calendar year 2015, OG&E's electric generation, purchased power and fuel procurement processes and costs were prudent.
Oklahoma Rate Case Filing - 2015
On December 18, 2015, OG&E filed a general rate case with the OCC requesting a rate increase of $92.5 million and a 10.25 percent return on equity based on a common equity percentage of 53.0 percent. The rate case was based on a June 30, 2015 test year and included recovery of $1.6 billion of electric infrastructure additions since its last general rate case in Oklahoma.
On July 1, 2016, OG&E implemented an annual interim rate increase of $69.5 million, subject to refund for amounts in excess of the rates approved by the OCC.
In December 2016, the ALJ issued a report and recommendations in the case. The ALJ's recommendations included, among other things, the use of OG&E's actual capital structure of 53.0 percent equity and 47.0 percent long-term debt and a return on equity of 9.87 percent resulting in an annual increase in OG&E's revenues of $40.7 million. 
During February and March 2017, the OCC held hearings and, on March 20, 2017, issued an order. The order resulted in an annual net increase of approximately $8.8 million in OG&E's rates to its Oklahoma retail customers. Although the order adopted certain recommendations set forth in the ALJ report, it differed in certain key respects. 
 6

The primary adjustments to the ALJ report consist of: (i) Oklahoma retail authorized rate of return on equity of 9.50 percent, (ii) depreciation expense is reduced by approximately $28.6 million from the ALJ report or $36.4 million from then current rates on an annual basis, (iii) recovery of 50.0 percent of short-term incentive compensation and no recovery of long-term incentive compensation, (iv) recovery of OG&E's requested vegetation management expenses and (v) recovery of production tax credits expiring in 2017 and air quality control systems consumable costs through the fuel adjustment clause. The order maintained OG&E's existing capital structure of 53.0 percent equity and 47.0 percent long-term debt.
As a result of the March 2017 OCC rate order, OG&E recorded, in the first quarter of 2017, adjustments to depreciation expense, amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities and impacts to the fuel adjustment clause effective July 1, 2016. On May 1, 2017, OG&E implemented new rates and began refunding excess amounts that it had collected in interim rates.
As of November 30, 2017, OG&E had completed the refund of $47.5 million collected in excess interim rates.
Mustang Modernization Plan - Arkansas
On August 15, 2017, OG&E filed for a determination with the APSC that the Mustang facility is in the public interest. The filing did not seek recovery for any costs associated with the Mustang Modernization Plan, as request for recovery of costs will take place with the first formula rate filing expected to be made in October 2018. On January 2, 2018, the APSC issued an order finding the Mustang Modernization Plan to be in the public interest.
Pending Regulatory Matters
Set forth below is a list of various proceedings pending before state or federal regulatory agencies. Unless stated otherwise, OG&E cannot predict when the regulatory agency will act or what action the regulatory agency will take. OG&E's financial results are dependent in part on timely and adequate decisions by the regulatory agencies that set OG&E's rates. 
Environmental Compliance Plan
On August 6, 2014, OG&E filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA’s MATS and Regional Haze Rule FIP while serving the best long-term interests of customers in light of future environmental uncertainties. The application sought approval of the ECP and for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. The ECP includes installing Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. The application also asked the OCC to predetermine the prudence of its Mustang Modernization Plan and approval for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs.
On December 2, 2015, OG&E received an order from the OCC denying its plan to comply with the environmental mandates of the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze Rule and MATS. The OCC also denied OG&E's request for pre-approval of its Mustang Modernization Plan, revised depreciation rates for both the retirement of the Mustang units and the replacement combustion turbines and pre-approval of early retirement and replacement of generating units at its Mustang site, including cost recovery through a rider.
On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving its decision to install Dry Scrubbers at the Sooner facility. OG&E's application did not seek approval of the costs of the Dry Scrubber project. Instead, the reasonableness of the costs would be considered after the project is completed, and OG&E seeks recovery in a general rate case.  On April 28, 2016, the OCC approved the Dry Scrubber project. 
Two parties appealed the OCC's decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The Company is unable to predict what action the Oklahoma Supreme Court may take or the timing of any such action.
OG&E anticipates the total cost of Dry Scrubbers will be $542.4 million, including allowance for funds used during construction and capitalized ad valorem taxes and expects the project to be completed in mid to late 2018. As of December 31, 2017, OG&E had invested $401.3 million in the Dry Scrubbers. OG&E anticipates the total cost for the Mustang Modernization Plan will be $390.0 million, including allowance for funds used during construction and capitalized ad valorem taxes and expects the project to be completed in early 2018.  As of December 31, 2017, OG&E had invested $348.4 million in the Mustang Modernization Plan.

Integrated Resource Plans 
In October 2015, OG&E finalized the 2015 IRP and submitted it to the OCC. The 2015 IRP updated certain assumptions contained in the IRP submitted in 2014 but did not make any material changes to the ECP and other parts of the plan. Currently, OG&E is scheduled to update its IRP in Oklahoma by October 1, 2018 and in Arkansas by October 31, 2018.
Demand Program Rider - Energy Efficiency Lost Net Revenues 
During the May 2017 implementation of new rates, OG&E reserved $5.6 million, pending resolution of a dispute with the OCC's Public Utility Division staff, regarding recovery of certain lost revenues associated with energy efficiency incurred prior to the March 2017 OCC rate order. These lost revenues are included within the total Demand Program Rider regulatory asset balance of $31.6 million as disclosed in Note 1 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Fuel Adjustment Clause Review for Calendar Year 2016
On August 3, 2017, the OCC staff filed an application to review OG&E's fuel adjustment clause for calendar year 2016, including the prudence of OG&E's electric generation, purchased power and fuel procurement costs. On February 7, 2018, an intervenor filed a recommendation to disallow the Oklahoma jurisdictional portion of $3.3 million related to wind sales in the SPP. A hearing is scheduled for March 29, 2018.
Oklahoma Rate Case Filing - 2018
On January 16, 2018, OG&E filed a general rate case in Oklahoma, requesting a rate increase of $1.9 million per year, assuming a 9.9 percent return on equity. The filing seeks recovery of the seven Mustang combustion turbines that are part of the Mustang Modernization Plan, requests an increase in depreciation rates to levels similar with rates in existence prior to the March 2017 OCC rate order and credits customers for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the Attorney General of Oklahoma requested that the OCC reduce the rates and charges for electric service and provide for any refund due to the customers of OG&E resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. In response, on January 4, 2018, the OCC ordered OG&E to record a reserve, beginning on January 4, 2018, to reflect the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent and the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income tax and any other tax implications of the 2017 Tax Act on an interim basis, subject to refund until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings and a final order is issued in OG&E's pending rate case filed on January 16, 2018. Further, the OCC ordered the amounts of any refunds of such reserves owed to customers should accrue interest at a rate equivalent to OG&E's cost of capital as previously recognized in the March 2017 OCC rate order. 
APSC Order - 2017 Tax Act
On January 12, 2018, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the APSC ordered OG&E to prepare and file an analysis, within 30 days of this order, of the ratemaking effects of the 2017 Tax Act on OG&E's revenue requirement and begin, effective January 1, 2018, to book regulatory liabilities to record the current and deferred impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. The APSC will subsequently solicit comments or testimony regarding the extent of the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and how any resulting benefits, including carrying charges, should be returned to customers.
FERC - Section 206 Filing
In January 2018, the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority filed a complaint at the FERC stating that the base return on common equity used by OG&E in calculating formula transmission rates under the SPP Open Access Transmission Tariff is unjust and unreasonable and should be reduced from 10.60 percent to 7.85 percent, effective upon the date of the complaint. The Company is analyzing the potential impact of the complaint but estimates that if the FERC ultimately orders a reduction, each 25 basis point reduction in the requested return on equity would reduce the Company's SPP Open Access Transmission Tariff transmission revenues by approximately $1.5 million annually. In addition to the request to reduce the return on equity, the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority's complaint also requests that modifications be made to OG&E's transmission formula rates to reflect the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. Although the proceeding is in the early stages, OG&E expects to contest the reduction of its base return on equity. The Company is unable to predict what action the FERC will take in response to the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority's complaint or the timing of such action. However, if the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
OG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates.  Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates.  Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.
OG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, OG&E had regulatory assets of $323.8 million and $526.6 million, respectively, and regulatory liabilities of $1,287.3 million and $312.0 million, respectively. These amounts include additional regulatory assets and liabilities for OG&E resulting from the reduction in the corporate federal tax rate enacted by the 2017 Tax Act. See Note 1 and Note 7 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
Management continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets.  When, in management's judgment, future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory asset is adjusted, as appropriate.  If OG&E were required to discontinue the application of accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities for some or all of its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets, which could have significant financial effects.
Rate Structures
Oklahoma
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus a fuel adjustment clause mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power.
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options.  Under OG&E's Smart Grid-enabled SmartHours programs, "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" rates offer customers the ability to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity and costs are at their lowest. The guaranteed flat bill option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set monthly price for an entire year. Another tariff rate option provides a "renewable energy" resource to OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. This renewable energy resource is a Renewable Energy Credit purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind and solar resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers. Another program being offered to OG&E's commercial and industrial customers is a voluntary load curtailment program called Load Reduction. This program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action. Customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response. This voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required. OG&E also offers certain qualifying customers "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options which allow participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on price signals received from OG&E. The prices for the "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options are based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs.
OG&E has Public Schools-Demand and Public Schools Non-Demand rate classes that provide OG&E with flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public schools and their unique usage patterns. OG&E also provides service level, seasonal and time period fuel charge differentiation that allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect the underlying costs of providing electric service.  Lastly, OG&E has a military base rider that demonstrates Oklahoma's continued commitment to our military partners.
The previously discussed rate options, coupled with OG&E's other rate choices, provide many tariff options for OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers.  The revenue impacts associated with these options are not determinable in future years because customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the alternative rate option choices.  Revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers' usage characteristics if they choose alternative rate options.

Arkansas
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus an energy cost recovery mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. In May 2017, the APSC approved a settlement requiring OG&E to be regulated under a formula rate rider. The formula rate rider provides for an adjustment to rates approved by the APSC in the May 2017 settlement if the earned rate of return falls outside of a plus or minus 50 basis point dead-band around the allowed return on equity. Adjustments are limited to plus or minus four percent of revenue for each rate class for the 12 months preceding the projected year. The initial term for the formula rate rider is not to exceed five years, unless additional approval is obtained from the APSC. 
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options. The "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" tariffs allow participating customers to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity is lowest. A second tariff rate option provides a "renewable energy" resource to OG&E's Arkansas retail customers. This renewable energy resource is a Renewable Energy Credit purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&E's Arkansas retail customers.  OG&E's ownership and access to wind resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers. OG&E offers its commercial and industrial customers a voluntary load curtailment program called Load Reduction. This program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis and receive a billing credit when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action. OG&E offers certain qualifying customers a "day-ahead price" rate option which allows participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on a price signal received from OG&E. The "day-ahead price" is based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs.
Fuel Supply and Generation
In 2017, 54.0 percent of OG&E-generated energy was produced by coal-fired units, 39.0 percent by natural gas-fired units and seven percent by wind-powered units. Of OG&E's 6,304 total MWs of generation capability reflected in the table in "Item 2. Properties," 3,304 MWs, or 52.4 percent, are from natural gas generation, 2,548 MWs, or 40.4 percent, are from coal generation, 449 MWs, or 7.1 percent, are from wind generation and 3 MWs, or 0.1 percent, are from solar generation. Over the last five years, the weighted average cost of fuel used, by type, was as follows:

Year Ended December 31 (In cents/Kilowatt-Hour) | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 
Natural gas | 2.821 | 2.488 | 2.529 | 4.506 | 3.905
Coal | 2.069 | 2.213 | 2.187 | 2.152 | 2.273
Total fuel | 2.211 | 2.199 | 2.196 | 2.752 | 2.784

The increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher natural gas prices. The increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher coal prices. The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices. The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to less natural gas used, partially offset by higher natural gas prices. These fuel costs are recovered through OG&E's fuel adjustment clauses that are approved by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.
OG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants.  The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers.  The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.
Coal
OG&E's coal-fired units, with an aggregate capability of 2,548 MWs, are designed to burn low sulfur western sub-bituminous coal.  The combination of all 2017 coal had a weighted average sulfur content of 0.23 percent. Based on the average sulfur content and EPA-certified data, OG&E's coal units have an approximate emission rate of 0.5 lbs. of SO2 per MMBtu.
 10

For 2018, OG&E has acquired approximately half of its forecasted annual coal usage via existing inventory and purchase contracts that expire in December 2019. In 2017, OG&E purchased 6.7 million tons of coal from various Wyoming suppliers. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of environmental matters which may affect OG&E in the future, including its utilization of coal.
Natural Gas
As a participant in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, OG&E now purchases a relatively small percentage of its natural gas supply through long-term agreements. Alternatively, OG&E relies on a combination of natural gas call agreements, whereby OG&E has the right but not the obligation to purchase a defined quantity of natural gas, combined with day and intra-day purchases to meet the demands of the SPP Integrated Marketplace. 
Wind
OG&E owns the 120 MW Centennial, 101 MW OU Spirit and 228 MW Crossroads wind farms. OG&E's current wind power portfolio also includes purchase power contracts with the following:

Company | Location | Term of Contract | Expiration of Contract | MWs 
CPV Keenan | Woodward County, OK | 20 years | 2030 | 152.0
Edison Mission Energy | Dewey County, OK | 20 years | 2031 | 130.0
NextEra Energy | Blackwell, OK | 20 years | 2032 | 60.0 
FPL Energy | Woodward, OK | 15 years | 2018 | 50.0 

Solar
In 2015, OG&E placed its first solar plant in service. The plant consists of two separate solar farms and is located in Oklahoma City, on the site of the Mustang generating facility. The Mustang solar plant has a maximum capacity of 2.5 MWs and consists of almost 10,000 photovoltaic panels.
OG&E began construction on a new 10 MW solar farm in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, OG&E had invested $17.9 million and expects the Covington, Oklahoma solar farm to be placed in service during the first quarter of 2018. OG&E will evaluate the need to build additional solar plants based on customer demand, cost and reliability. 
Safety and Health Regulation

OG&E is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, the EPA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the safety and health of workers.
In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials stored, used or produced in OG&E's operations and that this information be provided or made available to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. OG&E believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health.
NATURAL GAS MIDSTREAM OPERATIONS - ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS
Overview

Enable is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed to own, operate and develop strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets. Enable serves current and emerging production areas in the U.S., including several unconventional shale resource plays and local and regional end-user markets in the U.S. Enable's assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i) gathering and processing and (ii) transportation and storage. Enable's gathering and processing segment primarily provides natural gas and crude oil gathering and natural gas processing services to its producer customers. Enable's transportation and storage segment provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to its producer, power plant, LDC and industrial end-user customers.
Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are primarily located in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana and serve natural gas production in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable's crude oil gathering assets are located 
 11

in North Dakota and serve crude oil production in the Bakken Shale formation of the Williston Basin. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets consist primarily of an interstate pipeline system extending from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Louisiana, an interstate pipeline system extending from Louisiana to Illinois, an intrastate pipeline system in Oklahoma and an investment in SESH, a pipeline extending from Louisiana to Alabama.
Enable was formed on May 1, 2013 to own and operate the midstream businesses of the Company and CenterPoint. As of December 31, 2017, Enable's portfolio of midstream energy infrastructure assets included approximately 13,300 miles of natural gas and crude oil gathering pipelines, 15 major processing plants with 2.6 Bcf/d of processing capacity, approximately 7,800 miles of interstate pipelines (including SESH), approximately 2,200 miles of intrastate pipelines and eight natural gas storage facilities with 86.0 Bcf of storage capacity.

Gathering and Processing
Enable owns and operates substantial natural gas and crude oil gathering and natural gas processing assets in five states. Enable's gathering and processing operations consist primarily of natural gas gathering and processing assets serving the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins and crude oil gathering assets serving the Williston Basin. Enable provides a variety of services to the active producers in its operating areas, including gathering, compressing, treating, and processing natural gas, fractionating NGLs and gathering crude oil and produced water.
Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. The following table sets forth certain information regarding Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets as of or for the year ended December 31, 2017:

Asset/Basin | Approximate Length(Miles) | Approximate Compression(Horsepower) | AverageGatheredVolume(TBtu/d) | Number ofProcessingPlants | ProcessingCapacity(MMcf/d) | NGLsProduced(MBbl/d)
Anadarko Basin | 8,200 | 758,000 | 1.81 | 11 | 1,845 | 76.37 
Arkoma Basin | 3,000 | 133,500 | 0.55 | 1 | 60 | 4.79 
Ark-La-Tex Basin(A) | 1,800 | 160,200 | 1.20 | 3 | 645 | 8.95 
Total | 13,000 | 1,051,700 | 3.56 | 15 | 2,550 | 90.11 


(A) | Ark-La-Tex Basin assets also include 14,500 Bbl/d of fractionation capacity and 6,300 Bbl/d of ethane pipeline capacity, which are not listed in the table.

Enable's natural gas gathering assets include approximately 13,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as of December 31, 2017. Enable's natural gas gathering systems consist of networks of pipelines that collect natural gas from points at or near its customers' wells for delivery to plants for processing or pipelines for transportation. Natural gas is moved from the receipt points to the delivery points on Enable's gathering systems by the use of compression.
Enable's natural gas processing assets included 15 natural gas processing plants with 2,550 MMcf/d of inlet capacity as of December 31, 2017. Natural gas is comprised primarily of methane, but, at the wellhead, natural gas may contain varying amounts of NGLs. Enable's processing plants recover NGLs from natural gas and primarily deliver NGLs and natural gas to pipelines for transportation.
Crude Oil Gathering. As of December 31, 2017, Enable had approximately 175 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines and approximately 160 miles of produced water gathering pipelines in the Bakken Shale of the Williston Basin. Enable's crude 
 12

oil gathering systems have a combined design capacity of 57.9 MBbl/d, and as of December 31, 2017, Enable had 0.2 million gross acres dedicated under a crude oil gathering agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Enable had an average daily throughput of 25.56 MBbl/d of crude oil and an average daily throughput of 9.7 MBbl/d of produced water on Enable's Williston Basin gathering system.
Enable's Williston Basin crude oil gathering assets are located in Dunn, McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties in North Dakota. These systems were designed and built to serve the crude oil production of XTO Energy, Inc. in these areas. On Enable's systems, crude oil is received on crude oil gathering pipelines near its customers' wells for delivery to third party transportation pipelines, and produced water is received by produced water gathering pipelines for delivery to third party disposal wells. Enable does not take title to crude oil or produced water gathered, and it does not own or operate produced water disposal wells.
Delivery Points. Natural gas that is gathered, and when applicable, processed, is typically redelivered to Enable's customers at interconnections with transportation pipelines. Enable's gathering lines interconnect with both its interstate and intrastate pipelines, as well as other interstate and intrastate pipelines, including the Acadian, ANR, ETC Tiger, Gulf Crossing, Gulf South, NGPL, Northern Natural, Panhandle Eastern, Regency, Southern Natural Gas, Tennessee Gas and Texas Eastern Transmission pipelines. These connections provide producers with access to a variety of natural gas market hubs.
Crude oil gathered on Enable's Williston Basin gathering systems in Dunn and McKenzie Counties can be redelivered to Enable's customers through interconnections to the BakkenLink Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. Crude oil gathered on Enable's Williston Basin gathering systems in Williams and Mountrail Counties can be redelivered to Enable's customers through interconnections to the Enbridge North Dakota Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Enable typically purchases the NGLs produced at its processing plants, and most of the NGLs are delivered into third-party pipelines and transported to Conway, Kansas or Mont Belvieu, Texas, where the NGLs are exchanged for fractionated NGLs that are sold under contract or on the spot market. At Enable's Cox City, Calumet and Wetumka plants, Enable operates depropanizers that allow it to extract propane from the NGL stream and sell propane to local markets. Additionally, Enable operates a fractionator at its Waskom plant and sells ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline to local markets.
Customers. Enable generates revenues from producers in the basins in which it operates. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Enable's top natural gas gathering and processing customers by gathered volumes were Continental Resources, Inc., Vine Oil and Gas, GeoSouthern Energy Corporation, XTO Energy Inc., Tapstone Energy, LLC, Apache Corporation, BP America Production Company, affiliates of Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Covey Park Energy LLC and FourPoint Energy, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Enable's top ten natural gas producer customers accounted for approximately 70 percent of its gathered natural gas volumes. 
Enable's Williston Basin gathering systems serve XTO Energy Inc. The rates and terms of service on Enable's Williston Basin crude oil gathering systems are regulated by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, but Enable's Williston Basin produced water gathering systems are not FERC-regulated. As of December 31, 2017, XTO Energy Inc. was Enable's only customer on these systems.
Contracts. Enable's contracts typically provide for natural gas and crude oil gathering services that are fee-based and for natural gas processing arrangements that are fee-based, or percent-of-liquids, percent-of-proceeds or keep-whole based. 
Under a typical fee-based processing arrangement, Enable processes the raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, purchases the NGLs from the producer less a fee, returns the processed natural gas to the producer and sells the NGLs for its own account.
Under a typical percent-of-liquids processing arrangement, Enable processes the raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, purchases the NGLs from the producer at a discount, returns the processed natural gas to the producer and sells the NGLs for its own account.
 Under a typical percent-of-proceeds processing arrangement, Enable processes the raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, purchases the NGLs and an agreed upon percentage of the processed natural gas from the producer at a discount, returns the remaining processed natural gas to the producer and sells the purchased natural gas and NGLs for its own account.
Under a typical keep-whole arrangement, Enable processes raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, returns a quantity of the processed natural gas to the producer that is equivalent to the raw natural gas on a Btu basis and retains and sells the NGLs for its own account.
 13

For the year ended December 31, 2017, 58 percent, 35 percent and seven percent of Enable's inlet volumes were under processing arrangements that were fee-based, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and keep-whole, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 74 percent of Enable's gathering and processing gross margin was fee-based, and the remaining 26 percent of its gathering and processing gross margin was primarily from sales of commodities, including natural gas, NGLs and condensate received under percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-liquids and keep-whole arrangements. 
In lean gas areas, such as the eastern Arkoma Basin and the Haynesville Shale of the Ark-La-Tex Basin, some of Enable's natural gas gathering contracts contain minimum volume commitments from Enable's customers. In addition, a portion of the crude oil gathered by Enable's crude oil gathering system is under a contract with a minimum volume commitment. Under a minimum volume commitment, a customer agrees to either deliver a minimum volume of natural gas or crude oil to Enable's system for service or pay the service fees for the minimum volume of natural gas or crude oil regardless of whether or not the minimum volume of natural gas or crude oil is delivered. Enable calls any payment for the difference between the volume gathered and the minimum volume committed a shortfall payment. Some of Enable's contracts provide its customers the option to elect to pay a higher gathering fee over the remaining term of the contract in lieu of making a shortfall payment. As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of Enable's gathering and processing gross margin attributable to natural gas gathering contracts with minimum volume commitments, and the volume commitment-weighted average remaining terms of those contracts, were as follows:

 | Anadarko Basin | Arkoma Basin | Ark-La-Tex Basin | Williston Basin (B) | Total
Percentage of gathering and processing gross margin attributable to gathering contracts with minimum volume commitments | — | % | 7 | % | 18 | % | 2 | % | 27 | %
Percentage attributable to shortfall payments (A) | — | % | 80 | % | 39 | % | — | % | 47 | %
Volume commitment-weighted average remaining contract term (in years) | — | | 5.9 | | 2.1 | | 11.2 | | 3.7 | 


(A) | Represents the percentage of gathering and processing gross margin from gathering contracts with minimum volume commitments that were attributable to shortfall payments.


(B) | Under the Williston Basin contracts, if the customer ships in excess of the minimum volume, this volume commitment could end before the expiration of the contract term.

For Enable's gathering and processing contracts that do not have minimum volume commitments, Enable strives to obtain acreage dedications. Under an acreage dedication, a customer agrees to deliver all of the natural gas or crude oil produced from a given area to Enable's system for gathering and, if applicable, processing. As of December 31, 2017, the gross acres dedicated under gathering agreements and the volume-weighted average remaining term for all gathering and processing contracts were as follows: 

 | Anadarko Basin | Arkoma Basin | Ark-La-Tex Basin | Williston Basin | Total
Gross acreage dedication (in millions) | 5.0 | | 1.7 | | 0.8 | 0.2 | 7.7
Volume-weighted average remaining contract term (in years) | 6.1 | | 2.3 | | 5.4 | 11.9 | 5.5

Acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Enable acquired Align Midstream, LLC, a midstream company with natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Cotton Valley and Haynesville plays of the Ark-La-Tex Basin. The acquisition included approximately 190 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines across Rusk, Panola and Shelby counties in Texas and DeSoto Parish in Louisiana and a cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Panola County, Texas, with a capacity of 100 MMcf/d.
Competition. Competition to gather and process natural gas is primarily a function of gathering rate, processing value, system reliability, fuel rate, system run time, construction cycle time and prices at the wellhead. Enable's gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities. In the process of selling NGLs, Enable competes against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs. Enable's primary competitors are other midstream companies who are active in the regions where Enable operates.
Competition to gather crude oil and produced water is primarily a function of rates, terms of service, system reliability and construction cycle time. The rates and terms of service of Enable's crude oil gathering, but not its produced water gathering, 
 14

are FERC-regulated. Enable's Williston Basin gathering systems compete with other gatherers, including those affiliated with producers and other midstream companies. 
Seasonality. While the results of Enable's gathering and processing segment are not materially affected by seasonality, from time to time its operations and construction of assets can be impacted by inclement weather.
Transportation and Storage
Enable owns and operates interstate and intrastate transportation and storage systems across nine states. Enable's transportation and storage systems consist primarily of its interstate systems, EGT and MRT, its intrastate system, EOIT, and its investment in SESH. Enable's transportation and storage assets transport natural gas from areas of production and interconnected pipelines to power plants, LDCs and industrial end users as well as interconnected pipelines for delivery to additional markets. Enable's transportation and storage assets also provide facilities where natural gas can be stored by customers.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding Enable's transportation and storage assets as of or for the year ended December 31, 2017:

Asset | Length(Miles) | Compression(Horsepower) | Average Throughput (TBtu/d) | Transportation Capacity(Bcf/d) (A) | | Transportation Firm Contracted Capacity(Bcf/d) (B) | | Storage Capacity (Bcf) | | Storage Firm Contracted Capacity(Bcf/d) |

Total | 9,990 | | 829,000 | 5.1 | | 9.3 | | 6.21 | | 86.0 | | 63.19 | 


(A) | Actual volumes transported per day may be less than total firm contracted capacity based on demand.


(B) | Includes contracts with Enable's affiliates and subsidiaries.


(C) | Enable's EOIT pipeline system is a web-like configuration with multidirectional flow capabilities between numerous receipt and delivery points, which limits Enable's ability to determine an overall system capacity. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the peak daily throughput was 2.3 TBtu/d or, on a volumetric basis, 2.3 Bcf/d. 


(D) | SESH has 1.09 Bcf/d of transportation capacity from Perryville, Louisiana to its endpoint in Mobile County, Alabama.

(E) Enable owns a 50 percent interest in SESH and, as such, does not include certain information regarding its transportation and storage assets in the table above.
 Enable's transportation and storage assets were designed and built to primarily serve large natural gas and electric utilities in its areas of operation. In addition, Enable's transportation and storage assets serve natural gas producers, industrial end users and natural gas marketers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Enable's top transportation and storage customers by revenue were affiliates of CenterPoint, Spire Inc., American Electric Power Co., the Company, Continental Resources, Inc., XTO Energy Inc., Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC, Entergy Corporation and Shell Energy North America.
 From time to time, Enable's transportation and storage business involves the construction of natural gas pipelines as needed to serve Enable's existing and new customers. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, Enable added 4,500 horsepower of compression and invested $51 million in the construction of transportation pipelines. In April 2017, EGT announced the Cana and Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties Expansion project, a system expansion providing firm transportation service for growing Anadarko Basin production. The project’s foundation shipper, Newfield Exploration Company, entered into a 205,000 Dth/d firm natural gas transportation agreement with EGT. The 10-year contract is expected to start at an initial capacity of 45,000 Dth/d in early 2018 and grow to the full contracted capacity by the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, Enable is currently building an approximately 80-mile pipeline to expand the EOIT system in connection with a 228,000 Dth/d firm natural gas transportation agreement with the Company that is expected to be in-service in late 2018.
Enable's transportation assets include approximately 10,000 miles of transportation pipelines in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas and Missouri, providing access to natural gas supplies from the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins to natural gas consuming markets in the Southeastern, Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. Enable's storage assets, as of December 31, 2017, provide a combined capacity of 86.0 Bcf with 2.1 Bcf/d of aggregate maximum withdrawal capacity from Enable's seven storage facilities in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Illinois and from its undivided 1/12th interest in the Bistineau Storage 
 15

Facility in Louisiana. Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP owns an undivided 11/12th interest in, and operates, the Bistineau Storage Facility. In addition, Enable has contracted for 2.5 Bcf of firm storage capacity in Cardinal’s Perryville salt cavern storage facility.
Enable's transportation and storage assets are comprised of three categories: (1) interstate transportation and storage, (2) intrastate transportation and storage and (3) Enable's investment in SESH.
Interstate Transportation and Storage
Enable's interstate transportation and storage business consists of EGT and MRT. As interstate pipelines, EGT and MRT are subject to regulation as natural gas companies by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
EGT
EGT provides natural gas transportation and storage services primarily to customers in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Kansas. In addition to 5,900 miles of interstate pipelines with capacity of 6.5 Bcf/d, EGT has two underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma and one underground natural gas storage facility in Louisiana, which, as of December 31, 2017, operate at a combined capacity of 30.5 Bcf with 739 MMcf/d of aggregate maximum withdrawal capacity.
Customers. EGT primarily serves LDCs owned by CenterPoint, producers in key plays in the Mid-continent, power plants, other LDCs and industrial end-users. EGT’s customers are primarily located in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 28 percent of EGT's service revenue was attributable to contracts with LDCs owned by CenterPoint with a volume-weighted average contract life of 3.0 years for transportation contracts and 3.2 years for storage contracts. In addition to CenterPoint's LDCs, EGT’s other major customers include Continental Resources, Inc., American Electric Power Co., Chesapeake Energy Corporation and XTO Energy Inc.
Contracts. Although EGT has established maximum rates for interstate transportation and storage services as required by the FERC, EGT is authorized to enter into negotiated rate and discounted rate agreements with its customers. EGT’s services are typically provided under firm, fee-based transportation and storage agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 53 percent of Enable's transportation and storage gross margin was derived from EGT’s firm contracts, 70 percent of EGT’s transportation capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 3.2 years, and 75 percent of EGT’s storage capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 3.2 years. EGT’s firm transportation contracts representing 10 percent of CenterPoint's LDCs firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in March 2018 and 90 percent are scheduled to expire in March 2021. All of CenterPoint's LDCs firm storage contracts with EGT are scheduled to expire in March 2021.
Seasonality. EGT provides gas transmission delivery services to LDCs owned by CenterPoint in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Customer demand for natural gas on EGT is usually greater during the winter, primarily due to LDC demand to serve residential and commercial natural gas requirements. In addition, EGT experiences seasonal impacts associated with storage spreads and basis spreads on interconnected pipelines, as well as power plant demand.
Competition. EGT competes with a variety of other interstate and intrastate pipelines across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Enable's management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates and terms, flexibility and reliability of service. EGT provides both flexibility and reliability of service with access to multiple sources of supply in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins and access to multiple markets in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast through interconnections with other pipelines. EGT’s interconnections with other pipelines are primarily at Enable's Perryville Hub.
MRT
MRT provides natural gas transportation and storage services principally in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Illinois. In addition to 1,600 miles of interstate pipelines with capacity of 1.7 Bcf/d, MRT has one underground natural gas storage facility in Louisiana and one underground natural gas storage facility in Illinois, which, as of December 31, 2017, operate at a combined capacity of 31.5 Bcf with 717 MMcf/d of aggregate maximum withdrawal capacity.
Customers. MRT primarily serves the St. Louis LDC owned by Spire Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 61 percent of MRT's service revenue was attributable to Spire Inc. under contracts with a volume-weighted average contract life of 1.3 years for transportation contracts and 1.4 years for storage contracts. MRT’s other customers include utilities and industrial end users. MRT’s customers are primarily located in Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois.
 16

Contracts. MRT’s services are typically provided under firm, fee-based transportation and storage agreements, with rates and terms of service regulated by the FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 14 percent of Enable's transportation and storage gross margin was derived from MRT’s firm contracts, 96 percent of MRT’s transportation capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.9 years and 91 percent of MRT’s storage capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.6 years. MRT’s firm transportation contracts representing 63 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in July 2018, and 37 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in July 2020. All of Spire Inc.'s firm storage contracts are scheduled to expire in May 2019.
In January 2017, Spire Inc. filed an application with the FERC to construct the Spire STL Pipeline, which would be an additional interstate pipeline serving the St. Louis, Missouri market. Subject to receiving approval of the proposed project from the FERC, Spire Inc. has indicated that it is targeting an early to mid-2019 in-service date for this pipeline. If Spire Inc. constructs this pipeline, Enable anticipates that Spire Inc.'s need for firm transportation and storage capacity on MRT will decrease.
Seasonality. Customer demand for natural gas on MRT is usually greater during the winter, primarily due to LDC demand to serve residential and commercial natural gas requirements. In addition, MRT experiences seasonal impacts associated with storage spreads and basis spreads on market-based pipelines.
Competition. MRT competes with various intrastate pipelines providing natural gas to the St. Louis market. In addition, MRT, from time-to-time, competes with potential projects to connect one or more third party interstate pipelines to the St. Louis market, such as the proposed Spire Inc. STL Pipeline. Enable's management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service. MRT, through its interconnections with a variety of interstate and intrastate pipelines and its access to supply from a variety of producing basins, provides its customers with access to a variety of natural gas supply sources.
Intrastate Transportation and Storage
Enable's intrastate transportation and storage assets consist primarily of EOIT. EOIT provides transportation and storage services in Oklahoma. Enable's EOIT system delivers natural gas from the Arkoma and Anadarko Basins, including growth areas in the Cana Woodford, Granite Wash, Cleveland, Tonkawa, South Central Oklahoma Oil Province, Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties and Mississippi Lime Shale plays in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, to utilities and industrial end users connected to EOIT and to interstate and intrastate pipelines interconnected with EOIT. EOIT had 1.88 TBtu/d of average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to the 2,200 miles of intrastate pipelines, EOIT has two underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, which, as of December 31, 2017 operate at a combined capacity of 24 Bcf with 605 MMcf/d of aggregate maximum withdrawal capacity. As of December 31, 2017, Enable's intrastate transportation also included a 20-mile intrastate pipeline in Illinois. This 20-mile intrastate pipeline became part of the MRT system on January 1, 2018.
Customers. EOIT’s customers include Oklahoma’s two largest electric utilities, OG&E and Public Service Company of Oklahoma, an affiliate of American Electric Power Co. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately six percent of Enable's total transportation and storage gross margin was attributable to a firm contract with its affiliate OG&E, and approximately three percent of Enable's transportation and storage gross margin was attributable to a firm contract with Public Service Company of Oklahoma. Enable's transportation agreement with OG&E extends through April 30, 2019 and will remain in effect year to year thereafter unless either party provides notice of termination to the other party at least 180 days prior to the commencement of the succeeding annual period. Enable's transportation agreement with Public Service Company of Oklahoma extends through December 31, 2020 and includes the option for a one-year extension. EOIT’s customers also include other electric generators, LDCs, Arkoma and Anadarko Basin producers and industrial end users.
Contracts. EOIT provides fee-based firm and interruptible transportation and storage services on both an intrastate basis and, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, on an interstate basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 21 percent of Enable's transportation and storage gross margin was derived from EOIT’s firm contracts. EOIT's transportation capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 5.5 years, and EOIT's storage capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 0.9 years. 
Seasonality. EOIT provides gas transmission delivery services to the majority of OG&E's and all of Public Service Company of Oklahoma's natural gas-fired electric generation facilities in Oklahoma. Customer demand for natural gas transportation and storage services on EOIT is usually greater during the summer, primarily due to demand by natural gas-fired power plants to serve residential and commercial electricity requirements.
 17

Competition. EOIT competes with a variety of interstate and intrastate pipelines in providing transportation and storage services in Oklahoma, including competing against several pipelines with which EOIT interconnects. Enable's management views competition in the transportation and storage market as primarily a function of rates, terms of services, flexibility and reliability of service. EOIT’s integrated transportation and storage system allows Enable to provide load following service to natural gas-fired power plants to allow the power plants the ability to regulate generation and meet the instantaneous changes in customer demand for electricity.
Enable's Investment in SESH
SESH is an approximately 290-mile interstate pipeline that provides transportation services in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Enable owns a 50 percent interest in SESH and provides field operations for the pipeline. Spectra Energy Partners, LP owns the remaining 50 percent interest in SESH and provides gas control and commercial operations for the pipeline. As of December 31, 2017, SESH had 1.09 Bcf/d of transportation capacity from Perryville, Louisiana to its endpoint in Mobile County, Alabama.

Customers and Contracts. SESH’s customers are primarily companies that generate electricity for the Florida power market. The rates charged by SESH for interstate transportation services are regulated by the FERC. SESH’s transportation services are typically provided under firm, fee-based negotiated rate agreements. SESH's transportation contracts have a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 4.4 years.
Seasonality. SESH is generally not impacted by seasonality, SESH's load factor generally remains constant throughout the year.
Competition. SESH competes with other interstate and intrastate pipelines providing access to the Southeast power generation market. Enable's management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates and terms, flexibility and reliability of service.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

General

The activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations.  Management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.

In the past, environmental regulation caused the Company to incur significant costs because the trend was to place more and more restrictions and limitations on the Company's activities. The Trump administration has delayed, reversed or proposed to repeal some of these regulations and generally has not sought to adopt new, more stringent regulations. Nonetheless, the Company continues to have obligations to take or complete action under previously adopted environmental rules, and the Company cannot assure that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause it to incur significant costs for environmental matters.
It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2018 will be $189.2 million, of which $170.0 million is for capital expenditures.  It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2019 will be approximately $51.8 million, of which $35.2 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E above include capital expenditures for Dry Scrubbers and conversion of two coal-fueled units to natural gas. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.
For a further discussion of environmental matters that may affect the Company, see "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

FINANCE AND CONSTRUCTION
Future Capital Requirements
Capital Requirements
The Company's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities at OG&E.  Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes.  The Company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) and permanent financings. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of the Company's capital requirements.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company made a $20.0 million contribution to its Pension Plan in both 2017 and 2016. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2018. See "Future Capital Requirements" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Common Stock Dividends
At the Company's September 2017 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.33250 per share from $0.30250 per share effective in October 2017.  See "Future Capital Requirements" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion.
Financing Activities and Future Sources of Financing
Management expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock to the public through the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities.   The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.
Short-Term Debt and Credit Facilities
Short-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement.  In March 2017, the Company and OG&E each entered into new $450.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreements which expire March 2022. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $168.4 million of short-term debt compared to $236.2 million at December 31, 2016. The average balance of short-term debt in 2017 was $175.7 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.30 percent. The maximum month-end balance of short-term debt in 2017 was $260.1 million. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $731.3 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreements.  OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2018.  At December 31, 2017, the Company had $14.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 10 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
Issuance of Long-Term Debt
In March 2017, OG&E issued $300.0 million of 4.15 percent senior notes due April 1, 2047. The proceeds from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term debt, to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility, to fund the payment of OG&E's $125.0 million of 6.5 percent senior notes that matured on July 15, 2017 and to fund ongoing capital expenditures and working capital. 
In August 2017, OG&E issued $300.0 million of 3.85 percent senior notes due August 15, 2047. The proceeds from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term debt, to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and to fund ongoing capital expenditures and working capital.
Common Stock
The Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2018 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 8 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.
Distributions by Enable

Pursuant to the Enable Limited Partnership Agreement, Enable made distributions of $141.2 million, $141.2 million and $139.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
