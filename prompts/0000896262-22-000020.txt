ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Amedisys, Inc. is a leading healthcare services company committed to helping our patients age in place by providing clinically excellent care and support in the home. Our operations involve serving patients across the United States through our four operating divisions: home health, hospice, personal care and high acuity care. We deliver clinically distinct care that best suits our patients' needs, whether that is home-based recovery and rehabilitation after an operation or injury or care that empowers patients to manage a chronic disease through our home health division, hospice care at the end of life, providing assistance with daily activities through our personal care division or delivering the essential elements of inpatient hospital, palliative and skilled nursing facility ("SNF") care to patients in their homes through our high acuity care division.
We are among the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the United States, with approximately 21,000 employees in 528 care centers in 38 states within the United States and the District of Columbia. Our employees deliver the highest quality care performing more than 11.5 million visits for more than 445,000 patients annually. Over 3,000 hospitals and 90,000 physicians nationwide have chosen us as a partner in post-acute care.
Due to the age demographics of our patient base, our services are primarily paid for by Medicare which has represented approximately 74% to 75% of our net service revenue over the last three years. We also remain focused on maintaining a profitable and strategically important managed care contract portfolio. We continuously work with our payors to structure innovative contracts which reward us for providing quality care to our patients.
Amedisys is headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with an executive office in Nashville, Tennessee. Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol “AMED.” Founded and incorporated in Louisiana in 1982, Amedisys was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation prior to becoming a publicly traded company in August 1994.
Our strategy is to be the best choice for care wherever our patients call home. We accomplish this by providing clinically distinct care, being the employer of choice and delivering operational excellence and efficiency, which when combined, drive growth. Our mission is to provide best-in-class home health, hospice, personal care and high acuity care services allowing our patients to maintain a sense of independence, quality of life and dignity while delivering industry leading outcomes. We believe that our unwavering dedication to clinical quality and constant focus on both our patients and our employees differentiates us from our competitors.
Our Home Health Segment:
Our home health segment provides compassionate healthcare to help our patients recover from surgery or illness, live with chronic diseases and prevent avoidable hospital readmissions. Our home health footprint includes 331 care centers located in 34 states within the United States and the District of Columbia. Within these care centers, we deploy our care teams which include skilled nurses who are trained, licensed and certified to administer medications, care for wounds, monitor vital signs and provide a wide range of other nursing services; rehabilitation therapists specialized in physical, speech and occupational therapy; and social workers and aides who assist our patients with completing important personal tasks.
We take an empowering approach to helping our patients and their families understand their medical conditions, how to manage them and how to maximize the quality of their lives while living with a chronic disease or other health condition. Our clinicians are trained to understand the whole patient – not just their medical diagnosis.
Our commitment to clinical distinction is most evident in our clinical quality measures such as the Quality of Patient Care and Patient Satisfaction star ratings. In the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) reports for the January 2022 release, the Quality of Patient Care star average across all Amedisys providers was 4.33 with 95% of our care centers at 4+ stars and 37 care centers rated at 5 stars. Our Patient Satisfaction star average for the January 2022 release was 3.60, outperforming the industry average by 3%. Our goal is to have all care centers achieve a 4.0 Quality of Patient Care star rating, and we are implementing targeted action plans to continue to improve the quality of care we deliver for our patients and further our culture of quality.
Our Hospice Segment:
Hospice care is designed to provide comfort and support for those who are dealing with a terminal illness. It is a benevolent form of care that promotes dignity and affirms quality of life for the patient, family members and other loved ones. Individuals with a terminal illness such as cancer, heart disease, pulmonary disease or Alzheimer’s may be eligible for hospice care if they have a life expectancy of six months or less.
Since 2019, we have acquired Compassionate Care Hospice ("CCH"), RoseRock Healthcare ("RoseRock"), Asana Hospice ("Asana"), AseraCare Hospice ("AseraCare") and Visiting Nurse Association ("VNA"). With these acquisitions, Amedisys now owns and operates 175 hospice care centers in 34 states, providing care to more than 13,000 patients daily as the third largest hospice provider in the United States. Within these care centers, we deploy our care teams which include nurse practitioners and other skilled nurses, social workers, aides, bereavement counselors and chaplains.
Our focus is on building and retaining an exceptional team, delivering the highest quality care and service to our patients and their families and establishing Amedisys as the preferred and preeminent hospice provider in each community we serve. In order to realize these goals, we invest in tailored training, development and recognition programs for our employees, including medical record training, employee skills training and leadership development. This has led to our team’s consistent achievement at or above the national average in family satisfaction results and quality scores, as well as the trust of the healthcare community.
Another element of our approach is our outreach strategy to more fully engage the entire community of eligible patients. These outreach efforts have built our hospice patient population to more accurately represent the causes of death in the communities we serve, with a specific focus on heart disease, lung disease and dementia in order to address the historical underrepresentation of non-cancer diagnoses.
By working to accept every eligible patient who seeks end-of-life care, we fulfill our hospice mission and strengthen our standing in the community. 
Our Personal Care Segment:
Personal care provides assistance with the essential activities of daily living. Amedisys acquired its first personal care company in 2016 and continued to expand our personal care segment with four additional acquisitions. We currently operate 12 personal-care care centers in Massachusetts and one personal-care care center in each of Florida and Tennessee. 
Our High Acuity Care Segment:
The acquisition of Contessa Health ("Contessa") on August 1, 2021 established our high acuity care segment. Our high acuity care segment has the capability to deliver the essential elements of inpatient hospital, SNF care and palliative care to patients in their homes. In connection with the acquisition of Contessa, we obtained interests in a professional corporation that employs clinicians and eight joint ventures with health system partners. Additionally, the acquisition provided the Company with an advanced claims analytic platform, network management and additional capabilities to enter into risk-based arrangements with managed care organizations.
Our joint venture partners in the high acuity care segment represent national and large regional healthcare systems, each of which view the ability to provide inpatient level care in patients’ homes as critical to relieving capacity constraints within their facilities, providing care in a more cost-effective setting and keeping patients engaged with their health system brand by providing a superior patient experience. The patients who utilize our home-based recovery services typically have one or more chronic conditions that have historically required frequent emergency department visits and inpatient hospital stays. Our patient satisfaction scores for these home-based programs have consistently exceeded 90%, and we have successfully reduced hospital and skilled nursing readmission rates compared to historical baselines for these episodes of care. 
We provide management services to the joint ventures which include the development and implementation of clinical protocols to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of services in the home and high quality outcomes; an internally-developed technology platform that provides medical documentation, analytics and claims processing capabilities; provider network development services to ensure that all care resources are available to meet patient needs; and expertise in developing and negotiating contracts with third party health insurance payors to provide reimbursement on a risk-based episodic basis. Our expertise and capabilities in these areas deliver value to both the health system and the health insurance payor and give us the opportunity for future expansion within the healthcare continuum for chronically ill patients, including primary care at home and palliative care services, especially as the U.S. population ages and consumer preferences continue to shift to home-based care. Our joint 
venture partnership model with leading healthcare systems and our relationships with health plan insurers facilitate our ability to take and manage additional risk for this patient population in value-based arrangements.
Network Partnerships:
We have a network partnership with ClearCare, Inc. ("ClearCare"), the provider of the personal care industry’s leading software platform, representing 4,000 personal care agencies in every zip code in the United States, in order to better coordinate patient care. We also have a Care Coordination Agreement with BrightStar Care to add its agencies to the Amedisys personal care network, which helps facilitate the coordination of care between our home health and hospice care centers and a network of personal care partners. Long term, we believe these agreements will allow us to build a nation-wide network of personal care agencies and further our efforts to provide patients with a true care continuum in the home. These relationships will also help us as we continue to have innovative payment conversations with Medicare Advantage plans who have begun to recognize the value that combined home health, hospice, personal care and high acuity care services bring to their members and care delivery infrastructure.
Responding to the Changing Regulatory and Reimbursement Environment:
As the government continues to seek opportunities to refine payment models, we believe that our strategy of becoming a leader in providing a range of services across the at-home continuum positions us well for the future. Our ability to provide quality home health, hospice, personal care and high acuity care allows us to partner with health systems and managed care organizations to improve care coordination, reduce hospitalizations and lower costs.
Innovations:
In the coming year, our core business innovations will consist of workforce optimization, with a focus on new ways to engage, recruit and retain our clinical staff, and continuing to differentiate our service offerings as we build out our aging-in-place capabilities. The acquisition of Contessa in 2021 will also be a platform for continued innovations as we look to expand Contessa’s lines of business to include palliative care at home and home based primary care.
Acquisitions:
On May 1, 2021, we acquired the regulatory assets of a home health provider in Randolph County, North Carolina.
On July 1, 2021, we acquired VNA, a home health and hospice provider with locations in Nebraska and Iowa. 
On July 12, 2021, we acquired the regulatory assets of a home health provider in New York.
On August 1, 2021, we acquired Contessa, a leader in hospital-at-home and SNF at-home services.
On October 18, 2021, we acquired the regulatory assets of a home health provider in North Carolina. 
Financial Information:
Financial information for our home health, hospice, personal care and high acuity care segments can be found in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to our vision to be the leading aging-in-place company. Taking care of our people is our top priority. Our success is directly correlated with our ability to continue to attract, develop and retain the most qualified and passionate employees. Our work is not just a job but a calling. Our workforce strategy emanates from our core values of SPIRIT - Service, Passion, Integrity, Respect, Innovation and Talent. We know that by taking care of our people, they can continue to provide industry leading patient care. Our mission has never been more important than has been demonstrated during the public health emergency.
As of February 18, 2022, we employed approximately 21,000 people throughout the United States. We also utilize contract employees in the normal course of our business.
Diversity and Inclusion:
We endeavor to create a culture of caregiving where our employees feel as cared for every day as our patients. Success means all team members feel a sense of belonging, support and empowerment to be their best selves personally and professionally. We have committed to giving our employees a voice and have instituted numerous formal listening programs - quarterly pulse surveys, focus groups and town halls - to routinely gather feedback from our employees and address any concerns. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is also broadly reflected across our policies and people practices. Under the leadership of our employee-led Diversity and Inclusion Council, over 1,100 leaders participated in diversity and inclusion training designed to support a positive and inclusive work environment during 2021. Additionally, we have established three Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") to foster connection and community within our workforce: (1) Global Black Community, (2) LGBTQIA+ and (3) disAbilities.
We are also committed to having a diverse Board of Directors. Women currently comprise over half of the directors on our Board, and in December 2020, we expanded the Board to add a woman of color.
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development:
We strive to hire, develop and retain top talent. The core of our care delivery model is dependent upon attracting clinicians, predominately nurses. We compete for talent by offering a great culture, an opportunity to provide the highest quality clinical care and competitive market-based compensation. Our compensation plans are designed to deliver a competitive base pay as well as attractive incentive opportunities, primarily for leadership positions, but also to reward quality care. We provide significant opportunities for development and continuing education as we know that career development is a key component of attracting and retaining top talent. We continually monitor and assess employee metrics on hiring, retention and terminations to gain a deep understanding of our workforce and drive continuous improvement.
The continuing novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19") and demand for clinicians has pressured the labor markets. Clinicians are becoming harder to recruit and more costly to employ. Recently announced vaccine mandates could further impact the pool of available clinicians. Innovation in recruiting and a continued focus on retention are key initiatives for the Company to ensure adequate clinical capacity for our patients.
Health and Safety:
The health and well-being of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We offer a comprehensive benefit package that provides employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status. 
Our focus on the health and safety of our employees became even more critical during COVID-19, and Amedisys took action to protect, educate and care for our employees. Measures taken to continue to support our caregivers during the pandemic include: 
•Monitoring our clinical protocols for COVID-19 testing, proper usage of personal protective equipment ("PPE"), caring for COVID-positive patients and maintaining safety measures in our care centers;
•Maintaining our COVID-19 Resource Center available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for employees to access educational materials, safety documents, policies, clinical protocols and operational metrics;
•Providing access to COVID-19 self-test kits to all employees;
•Communicating each state's vaccination plan and developing a state by state protocol to work with local health departments and other health systems to obtain vaccine appointments for our clinical staff;
•Implementing a company-wide vaccine tracker to maintain documentation related to individual employee vaccination status to comply with both state and federal mandates;
•Providing paid leave during required quarantine periods; and
•Procuring millions in PPE and creating a centralized distribution center for all critical PPE, allowing us to flex our supplies on a care center by care center basis, based on need and demand.
Payment for Our Services
Our revenues are derived in large part from governmental third-party payors. Governmental payment programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to us for our services. It is possible that future budget cuts in Medicare and Medicaid may be enacted by Congress and implemented by CMS. Therefore, we cannot assure you that payments from governmental or private payors will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will, in the future, be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to such programs. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Overview – CMS Payment Updates" for additional information on the most recent regulations from CMS.
Home Health Medicare
The Medicare home health benefit is available both for patients who need home care following discharge from a hospital and patients who suffer from chronic conditions that require ongoing, but intermittent, care. 
As a condition of participation under Medicare, beneficiaries must be homebound (meaning that the beneficiary is unable to leave his/her home without a considerable and taxing effort), require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician. In order to provide greater flexibility during COVID-19, CMS has relaxed the definition of homebound status through the duration of the public health emergency. During the pandemic, a beneficiary is considered homebound if they have been instructed by a physician not to leave their house because of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis or if the patient has a condition that makes them more susceptible to contracting COVID-19. Therefore, if a beneficiary is homebound due to COVID-19 and requires skilled services, the services will be covered under the Medicare home health benefit.
Prior to January 1, 2020, Medicare payment rates were based on the severity of the patient’s condition, his or her service needs and other factors relating to the cost of providing services and supplies, bundled into 60-day episodes of care. An episode starts the first day a billable visit is performed and ends 60 days later or upon discharge, if earlier. If a patient is still in treatment on the 60th day, a recertification assessment is undertaken to determine whether the patient needs additional care. If the patient’s physician determines that further care is necessary, another episode begins on the 61st day (regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day) and ends 60 days later. The table below includes the 60-day base episode payment rates.

Period | Base EpisodePayment
January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 | $ | 3,154
January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (only applied to episodes beginning on December 31, 2019 or prior) | $ | 3,221

Effective January 1, 2020, CMS implemented a revised case-mix adjustment methodology, the Patient-Driven Groupings Model ("PDGM"). PDGM uses a 30-day period of care rather than a 60-day episode of care as the unit of payment, eliminates the use of the number of therapy visits provided in determining payment and relies more heavily on clinical characteristics and other patient information. Under PDGM, each 60-day episode includes two 30-day payment periods. The table below includes the base 30-day payment rates.

Period | Base 30-Day Payment
January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (only applies to episodes beginning on January 1, 2020 and thereafter) | $ | 1,864
January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 | $ | 1,901
January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 | $ | 2,032

PDGM uses timing, admission source, functional impairment levels and principal and other diagnoses to case-mix adjust payments. The case-mix adjusted payment for a 30-day period of care is subject to additional adjustments based on certain variables, including, but not limited to (a) an outlier payment if our patient's care was unusually costly (capped at 10% of total reimbursement per provider number); (b) a low utilization payment adjustment (“LUPA”) if the number of visits provided was less than the established threshold, which ranges from two to six visits and varies for every case-mix group under PDGM; (c) a partial payment if a patient transferred to another provider or from another provider before completing the 30-day period of care; and (d) the applicable geographic wage index. Payments for routine and non-routine supplies are included in the 30-day payment rate.
As a Medicare provider, we are subject to periodic audits by the Medicare program, and that program has various rights and remedies against us if they assert that we have overcharged the program or failed to comply with program requirements. Home health providers are subject to pre- and post-payment reviews for compliance with Medicare coverage guidelines and medical 
necessity. Adjustments on this basis may include individual claims adjustments or overpayment determinations based on an extrapolated sample of claims. Medical necessity reviews evaluate whether services are clinically appropriate in terms of frequency, type, extent, site and duration. Technical billing and documentation reviews focus on documentation of services. Medicare and other payors may reject or deny claims for payment if the underlying documentation does not support the medical necessity of services or fails to establish satisfaction of a coverage rule, such as if a provider is unable to perform periodic therapy assessments required by coverage criteria or cannot provide appropriate billing documentation, acceptable physician authorizations or face-to-face meeting documentation.
Medicare can reopen previously filed and reviewed claims and deny coverage of the services and require us to repay any overcharges, as well as make deductions from future amounts due to us. In the ordinary course of business, we appeal the Medicare and Medicaid program's denial of claims that we believe are inappropriate in an effort to recover the denied claims.
Home Health Non-Medicare
Payments from Medicaid and private insurance carriers are either a percentage of Medicare rates or per-visit rates depending upon the terms and conditions established with such payors. Reimbursements from our non-Medicare payors that are based on Medicare rates are paid in a similar manner and subject to the same adjustments as discussed above for Medicare; however, these rates can vary based upon negotiated terms which generally range from 95% to 100% of Medicare rates. Approximately 30% of our managed care contract volume affords us the opportunity to receive additional payments if we achieve certain quality or process metrics as defined in each contract (e.g. star ratings and acute-care hospitalization rates).
Hospice Medicare
The Medicare hospice benefit is available when a physician and specific clinical findings support a diagnosis of a terminal condition where the patient has a terminal diagnosis of six months or less. Hospice care is evaluated in benefit periods: two 90-day benefit periods followed by an unlimited number of 60-day benefit periods. Payments are based on daily rates for each day a beneficiary is enrolled in the hospice benefit. Payments are made according to a fee schedule that has four different levels of care: routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care and general inpatient care. The daily payment rates are intended to cover costs that hospices incur in furnishing services identified in patients' care plans, based on specific levels of care. Payments are adjusted by a wage index to reflect health care labor costs across the country and are established annually through federal legislation. 
Medicare payments include two separate payment rates for routine care: payments for the first 60 days of care and care beyond 60 days. In addition to the two routine rates, Medicare also reimburses for a service intensity add-on (“SIA”). The SIA is based on visits made in the last seven days of life by a registered nurse or medical social worker for patients in a routine level of care. 
Adjustments for eligibility and technical billing requirements may be made to Medicare revenue based on the same claims processing reviews described above for home health services when we find we are unable to obtain appropriate billing documentation, authorizations or face-to-face documentation and other reasons unrelated to credit risk.
Two caps limit the amount of payment that any individual hospice provider number can receive in a single year. Generally, each hospice care center has its own provider number; however, where we have created branch care centers to help our parent care centers serve a geographic location, the parent and branch have the same provider number. 
•Inpatient Cap: The inpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care an agency may provide to not more than 20 percent of its total patient care days. The daily Medicare payment rate for any inpatient days of service that exceed the cap is set at the routine home care rate, and the provider is required to reimburse Medicare for any amounts it receives in excess of the cap.
•Overall Payment Cap: The overall payment cap is an absolute dollar limit on the average annual payment per beneficiary a hospice agency can receive. This cap is calculated by the Medicare Administrative Contractor at the end of each hospice cap period to determine the maximum allowable payments per provider number. 
We estimate our potential cap exposure using information available for both inpatient day limits as well as per beneficiary cap amounts. The total cap amount for each provider is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation.
Payment rates for hospice care, the hospice cap amount and the hospice wage index are updated annually according to Section 1814(i)(1)(C)(ii)(VII) of the Social Security Act ("SSA"), which requires CMS to use the inpatient hospital market basket, adjusted for multifactor productivity and other adjustments as specified in the SSA, to determine the hospice payment update percentage. The caps are subject to annual and retroactive adjustments, which can cause providers to be required to reimburse 
the Medicare program if such caps are exceeded. Our ability to stay within these caps depends on a number of factors, each determined on a provider number basis, including the average length of stay and mix in level of care.
Hospice Non-Medicare
Non-Medicare payors pay at rates that differ from established Medicare rates for hospice services, and are based on separate, negotiated agreements. We bill and are paid by these non-Medicare payors based on such negotiated agreements.
Personal Care
Personal care payments are received from payor clients, including state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers, based on rates that are either contractual or fixed by legislation.
High Acuity Care
High acuity care payments are derived from two sources: health insurance plans and health system partners. Contracts with health insurance plans provide for fixed payment rates for a 30-day or 60-day episode of care indexed to assigned patient diagnoses in return for our obligation to assume risk for the coordination and payment of required medical services necessary to treat the medical condition for which the patient was diagnosed in a home-based setting. Contracts with health system partners provide for payments on a per diem basis at the contracted rate for each day during the remainder of an inpatient acuity stay serviced at the patient's home. 
The contracted payment rates are developed by our medical economics team using historical claims and inpatient admission data provided by the respective health insurance plan or health system partner. The data includes medical costs incurred outside of a patient’s historical inpatient stay that may be expected to continue under our program and an estimate of the cost of the medical services under our program which will replace the patient’s inpatient hospital stay. We mitigate the risk of excessive program medical costs by ensuring that we enroll eligible members into the plan, by effectuating clinically effective plans of care and by ensuring that all covered services are related to the condition for which the patient was admitted to the program. Additionally, we have purchased episodic stop-loss insurance for certain payor contracts. 
Controls Over Our Business System Infrastructure
We establish and maintain processes and controls over coding, clinical operations, billing, patient recertifications and compliance to help monitor and promote adherence with Medicare requirements.
•Coding – Specified international classification of disease ("ICD") diagnosis codes are assigned to each of our patients based on their particular health conditions (such as diabetes, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure). Because coding regulations are complex and are subject to frequent change, we maintain controls surrounding our coding process. To reduce the associated risk of coding failures, we provide annual update training to clinical managers, as needed training to care center directors and clinical managers and training during orientation for new employees to ensure accurate information is gathered and provided to our coding team. In addition, our electronic medical records system (Homecare Homebase) includes automated edits for home health and hospice based on pre-defined compliance metrics. For home health, we also provide monthly specialized coding education, obtain outside expert coding instruction and have certified coders review all patient outcome and assessment information sets (“OASIS”) and assign the appropriate ICD code. 
•Clinical Operations – We provide education on coverage criteria and conditions of participation and utilize outside expert regulatory services if necessary. Regulatory requirements allow patients to be eligible for home health care benefits if through a face-to-face visit with a physician, they are considered homebound and it is determined that skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services are required. These clinical services may include: educating the patient about their disease, assessment and observation of disease status, delivery of clinical skills such as wound care, administration of injections or intravenous fluids, management and evaluation of a patient’s plan of care, physical therapy services to assist patients with functional limitations and speech therapy services for speech or swallowing disorders. Patients eligible for hospice care are terminally ill (with a life expectancy of six months or less if the illness runs its normal course). Our hospice program provides care and support to our terminally ill patients with a 6-month prognosis and their families through services including medical care, counseling, spiritual care, pre-bereavement and bereavement support, medication management and needed equipment and supplies for the terminal illness and all related conditions. Our high acuity care clinical protocols include utilization of the Milliman Clinical Guidelines ("MCG") criteria to ensure that patients are eligible for inpatient level care, in-person evaluations by hospital-based physicians to determine the patient's clinical eligibility for home-based inpatient care, social and 
behavioral assessments to determine safety of the patient's home setting and an informed consent requirement to ensure that the patient and caregivers are comfortable with the delivery of inpatient level care in the home.
•Billing – We maintain controls over our billing processes to help promote accurate and complete billing. Processes and controls have been implemented to ensure that prior to the submission of any bills, the visit/occurrence was completed, documented sufficiently by an appropriate clinician and/or provider, and that the billed claim complies with all regulatory and payor requirements. Examples of process monitoring controls include conducting annual billing compliance testing, user access reviews for billing systems and use of automated daily billing operational indicators. We take prompt corrective action with employees who knowingly fail to follow our billing policies and procedures.
•Patient Recertification – In order to be recertified for an additional home health episode of care, a patient must continue to meet qualifying criteria and have a continuing medical need that requires the skills of a nurse or therapist. Changes in the patient’s condition may require changes to the patient’s medical regimen or modified care protocols within the episode of care. The patient’s progress towards established goals is evaluated prior to recertification. As with the initial episode of care, a recertification requires orders from the patient’s physician. Before any employee recommends recertification to a physician, we conduct a care center level, multidisciplinary care team conference. Specific tools are used to ensure that the patient continues to meet coverage criteria prior to recertifying. Hospice recertification for additional benefit periods of care require continued demonstration of a terminal prognosis as determined by the hospice physician in collaboration with the attending physician and the interdisciplinary care team.
•Compliance – We develop, implement and maintain ethics and compliance programs as a component of the centralized corporate services provided to our home health, hospice, personal care and high acuity-care care centers. Our ethics and compliance program includes a Code of Conduct for our employees, officers, directors, contractors and affiliates and a disclosure program for reporting regulatory or ethical concerns to our compliance team through a confidential hotline, which is augmented by exit surveys of departing employees. We promote a culture of compliance within our company through educational presentations, regular newsletters and persistent messaging from our senior leadership to our employees stressing the importance of strict compliance with legal requirements and company policies and procedures. Additionally, we have mandatory compliance training and testing for all new employees upon hire and annually for all staff thereafter. We also maintain a robust compliance audit program focusing on key risk areas.
Our Regulatory Environment
We are highly regulated by federal, state and local authorities. The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse prohibitions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, self-referrals by physicians and false claims submitted to federal health care programs). Regulations and policies frequently change, and we monitor changes through our internal government affairs department, as well as multiple trade and governmental publications and associations. 
Our home health and hospice subsidiaries are certified by CMS and therefore are subject to the rules and regulations of the Medicare system. Additionally, all of our business lines are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations dealing with issues such as occupational safety, employment, medical leave, insurance, civil rights, discrimination, building codes, privacy and recordkeeping. We have set forth below a discussion of the regulations that we believe most significantly affect our home health and hospice businesses.
Licensure, Certificates of Need ("CON") and Permits of Approval ("POA")
Home health and hospice care centers operate under licenses granted by the health authorities of their respective states. Some states require health care providers (including hospice and home health agencies) to obtain prior state approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care locations, capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, or changes in services. Additionally, certain states, including a number in which we operate, carefully restrict new entrants into the market based on demographic and/or demonstrative usage of additional providers. These states limit the entry of new providers or services and the expansion of existing providers or services in their markets through a CON or POA process, which is periodically evaluated and updated as required by applicable state law. For those states that require a CON or POA, the provider must complete a separate application process establishing a location and must receive required approvals.
To the extent a CON or other similar approvals are required to expand our operations, our expansion could be adversely affected by the inability to obtain the necessary approvals, changes in the standards applicable to those approvals and possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining those approvals.
In every state where required, our care centers possess a license and/or a CON or POA issued by the state health authority that determines the local service area for the home health or hospice care centers. Currently, state health authorities in 20 states and the District of Columbia require a CON or, in the State of Arkansas, a POA, in order to establish and operate a home health care center, and state health authorities in 12 states and the District of Columbia require a CON to operate a hospice care center.
We operate 245 home health care centers and 51 hospice care centers in the following CON/POA states as listed below.

Medicare Participation: Licensing, Certification and Accreditation
Our care centers must comply with regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") and CMS in order to participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payments. Sections 1861(o) and 1891 of the SSA, 42 CFR 484.1 et seq., establish the conditions that a home health agency ("HHA") must meet in order to participate in the Medicare program. Section 1861(dd) of the SSA, 42 CFR 418.1, et seq., establishes the conditions that a hospice provider must meet in order to participate in the Medicare program. Among other things, these regulations, applicable to HHAs and hospices, respectively, known as conditions of participation (“COPs”), relate to the type of facility, its personnel and its standards of medical care, as well as its compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. Additional COPs applicable to HHAs focus on the safe delivery of quality care provided to patients and the impact of that care on patient outcomes through the protection and promotion of patients' rights, care planning, delivery and coordination of services and streamlining of regulatory requirements. 
CMS has adopted alternative sanction enforcement options which allow CMS (i) to impose temporary management, direct plans of correction or direct training and (ii) to impose payment suspensions and civil monetary penalties in each case on providers out of compliance with the COPs. CMS engages or has engaged a number of third party contractors, including Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”), Program Safeguard Contractors (“PSCs”), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”), Uniform Program Integrity Contractors ("UPICs"), Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) and Supplemental Medical Review Contractors (“SMRCs”), to conduct extensive reviews of claims data and state and federal government health care program laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers. These audits evaluate the appropriateness of billings 
submitted for payment. In addition to identifying overpayments, audit contractors can refer suspected violations of law to government enforcement authorities.
All providers are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations in the U.S. and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and safety. We have dedicated internal resources and utilize external parties when necessary to monitor and ensure compliance with the various applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as requirements of applicable accrediting organizations.
If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our businesses) and exclusion of a facility from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. If any of our facilities were to lose its accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Federal and State Anti-Fraud and Anti-Kickback Laws
As a provider under the Medicare and Medicaid systems, we are subject to various anti-fraud and abuse laws, including the federal health care programs’ anti-kickback statute and, where applicable, its state law counterparts. Affected government health care programs include any health care plans or programs that are funded by the United States government (other than certain federal employee health insurance benefits/programs), including certain state health care programs that receive federal funds, such as Medicaid.
Subject to certain exceptions, these laws prohibit any offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or reward the referral of business payable under a government health care program or in return for the purchase, lease, order, arranging for, or recommendation of items or services covered under a government health care program. A related law forbids the offer or transfer of anything of value, including certain waivers of co-payment obligations and deductible amounts, to a beneficiary of Medicare or Medicaid that is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of health care providers, again, subject to certain exceptions. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute can result in imprisonment, the imposition of penalties exceeding $100,000, plus three times the amount of the improper remuneration and potentially, exclusion from furnishing services under any government health care program. In addition, the states in which we operate generally have laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers where they are designed to obtain the referral of patients from a particular provider.
Stark Law
The SSA includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities for the provision of designated health services with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception to the law's prohibition is met. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $26,125 for each violation, up to $174,172 for schemes to circumvent the Stark restrictions and up to $20,731 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including employment contracts and leases that adhere to certain enumerated requirements. 
Violations of the Stark Law result in payment denials and may also trigger civil monetary penalties and federal program exclusion. Several of the states in which we conduct business have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the federal anti-fraud and abuse laws and the Stark Law. These state laws may mirror the federal Stark Law or may be different in scope. The available guidance and enforcement activity associated with such state laws vary considerably.
We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to ensure that Amedisys meets all applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law. 
Federal and State Privacy and Security Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires us to comply with standards for the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties, such as payors, business associates and patients. These include standards for common health care transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures; unique identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and individuals; and security, privacy, breach notification and enforcement.
The HIPAA transaction regulations establish form, format and data content requirements for most electronic health care transactions, such as health care claims that are submitted electronically. The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive requirements relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information. The HIPAA security regulations establish minimum standards for the protection of protected health information that is stored or transmitted electronically. The HIPAA breach notification regulations establish the applicable requirements for notifying individuals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media in the event of a data breach affecting protected health information. Violations of the privacy, security and breach notification regulations are punishable by civil and criminal penalties.
Currently, civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations can range from $120 to $1.807 million per violation with a maximum fine of $1.807 million for multiple violations of the same provision during a calendar year. To date, the largest penalty imposed by HHS following a data breach is $16 million. State attorneys general may also bring civil enforcement actions under HIPAA, and attorneys general are actively engaged in enforcement. These penalties could be in addition to other penalties assessed by a state for a breach which would be considered reportable under a particular state’s data breach notification laws.
Recent changes to HIPAA have stimulated increased enforcement activity and enhanced the potential that health care providers will be subject to financial penalties for violations of HIPAA. In addition, the Secretary of HHS is required to perform periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. 
In addition to the federal HIPAA regulations, most states also have laws that protect the confidentiality of health information and other personally identifiable information, and these laws may be broader in scope with respect to protected health information and other personal information than HIPAA. Some of these laws grant individuals rights with respect to personal information, and we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with these laws. Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected persons and/or state regulators in the event of a data breach or compromise, including when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Some state breach notification laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information, such as social security numbers and bank and credit card account numbers. Violation of state privacy, security and breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties. In addition, certain states’ privacy, security and data breach laws, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, amended, effective January 1, 2023, as the California Privacy Rights Act, include private rights of action that may expose us to private litigation regarding our privacy practices and significant damages awards or settlements in civil litigation.
The False Claims Act
The federal False Claims Act ("FCA") prohibits false claims or requests for payment for health care services. Under the FCA, the government may penalize any person who knowingly submits, or participates in submitting, claims for payment to the Federal Government which are false or fraudulent, or which contain false or misleading information. Any person who knowingly makes or uses a false record or statement to avoid paying the Federal Government, or knowingly conceals or avoids an obligation to pay money to the Federal Government, may also be subject to fines under the FCA. Under the FCA, the term “person” means an individual, company or corporation. 
The Federal Government has used the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other governmental program fraud in areas such as violations of the Federal anti-kickback statute or the Stark Laws, coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. The FCA has also been used to prosecute people or entities that bill services at a higher reimbursement rate than is allowed and that bill for care that is not medically necessary. In addition to government enforcement, the FCA authorizes private citizens to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits, greatly extending the practical reach of the FCA. The per-claim penalty range is between $11,803 and $23,607 (last updated 2021).
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”) amended the FCA with the intent of enhancing the powers of government enforcement authorities and whistleblowers to bring FCA cases. In particular, FERA attempts to clarify that liability may be established not only for false claims submitted directly to the government, but also for claims submitted to 
government contractors and grantees. FERA also seeks to clarify that liability exists for attempts to avoid repayment of overpayments, including improper retention of federal funds. FERA also included amendments to FCA procedures, expanding the government’s ability to use the Civil Investigative Demand process to investigate defendants, and permitting government complaints and intervention to relate back to the filing of the whistleblower’s original complaint. FERA is likely to increase both the volume and liability exposure of FCA cases brought against health care providers.
In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (enacted in 2010), Congress enacted requirements related to identifying and returning overpayments made under Medicare and Medicaid. CMS finalized regulations regarding this so-called “60-day rule,” which requires providers to report and return Medicare and Medicaid overpayments within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. A provider who retains identified overpayments beyond 60 days may be liable under the FCA. “Identification” occurs when a person “has, or should have through the exercise of reasonable diligence,” identified and quantified the amount of an overpayment. The final rule also established a six-year lookback period, meaning overpayments must be reported and returned if a person identifies the overpayment within six years of the date the overpayment was received. Providers must report and return overpayments even if they did not cause the overpayment.
In addition to the FCA, the Federal Government may use several criminal statutes to prosecute the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the Federal Government. Many states have similar false claims statutes that impose liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act. As part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the “DRA”), Congress provides states an incentive to adopt state false claims acts consistent with the federal FCA. Additionally, the DRA requires providers who receive $5 million or more annually from Medicaid to include information on federal and state false claims acts, whistleblower protections and the providers’ own policies on detecting and preventing fraud in their written employee policies.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") Regulation
The FDA regulates medical device user facilities, which include home health care providers. FDA regulations require user facilities to report patient deaths and serious injuries to the FDA and/or the manufacturer of a device used by the facility if the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of any patient. FDA regulations also require user facilities to maintain files related to adverse events and to establish and implement appropriate procedures to ensure compliance with the above reporting and recordkeeping requirements. User facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and noncompliance with applicable requirements may result in warning letters or sanctions including civil monetary penalties, injunction, product seizure, criminal fines and/or imprisonment.
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act
In October 2014, the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act (“IMPACT Act”) was signed into law requiring the reporting of standardized patient assessment data for quality improvement, payment and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post-acute care providers (“PACs”), including skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. The IMPACT Act requires PACs to report: (1) standardized patient assessment data at admission and discharge; (2) quality measures, including functional status, skin integrity, medication reconciliation, incidence of major falls and patient preference regarding treatment and discharge; and (3) resource use measures, including Medicare spending per beneficiary, discharge to community and hospitalization rates of potentially preventable readmissions. Failure to report such data when required would subject a facility to a two percent reduction in market basket prices then in effect.
The IMPACT Act further requires HHS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, to study alternative PAC payment models, including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care setting, with corresponding Congressional reports required based on such analysis. The IMPACT Act also included provisions impacting Medicare-certified hospices, including: (1) increasing survey frequency for Medicare-certified hospices to once every 36 months; (2) imposing a medical review process for facilities with a high percentage of stays in excess of 180 days; and (3) updating the annual aggregate Medicare payment cap.
Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services
On June 8, 2016, CMS announced the implementation of a three-year Medicare Pre-Claim Review Demonstration for Home Health Services ("PCR") provided to beneficiaries in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts. The pre-claim review is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. On April 1, 2017, CMS paused the demonstration while CMS considered a number of changes. CMS revised the demonstration to incorporate more flexibility and choices for providers, as well as risk-based changes to reward providers who show compliance with Medicare home health policies.
On May 31, 2018, CMS issued a notice indicating its intention to re-launch an HHA pre-claim review demonstration project. The original program had drawn criticism that it created significant administrative burdens and reduced access to care. Now called the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services ("RCD"), the revised demonstration gives HHAs in the demonstration states three options: pre-claim review of all claims, post-payment review of all claims, or minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. Under the pre-claim review and post-payment review options, provider claims are reviewed for every episode of care until the appropriate claim approval rate (90% based on a minimum of ten pre-claim requests or claims submitted) is reached. Further, once the appropriate claim approval rate is reached, a provider can elect to opt-out of claim reviews except for a spot check of 5% of its claims to ensure continued compliance. The demonstration initially applies to HHA providers in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas, with the option to expand after five years to other states in the Medicare Administrative Contractor Jurisdiction M (Palmetto). In April 2019, CMS announced a June 1, 2019 start date for RCD in Illinois. In July 2019, CMS announced a September 30, 2019 start date for RCD in Ohio. Thereafter, in an October 21, 2019 release, CMS announced that it will reschedule the next phase of its RCD to allow agencies in Texas, North Carolina and Florida time to transition to PDGM. Throughout the first few months of 2020, CMS made various announcements about new start dates for the remaining three states, including a March 2, 2020 start date in Texas and projected start date of May 4, 2020 for North Carolina and Florida. The Texas portion began as scheduled; however, due to the ongoing Public Health Emergency ("PHE"), on March 31, 2020, CMS announced a voluntary pause of RCD for Illinois, Ohio and Texas and delay for beginning the demonstration in North Carolina and Florida. In July 2020, CMS announced its intention to resume the demonstration on August 30, 2020 for Illinois, Ohio and Texas and a voluntary phase-in for North Carolina and Florida. The voluntary phase-in was extended by CMS in October until January 1, 2021 and then again in December until March 31, 2021. Various other delays were announced throughout 2021 due to the PHE. On July 16, 2021, CMS announced full implementation of the RCD would be effective for providers in Florida and North Carolina September 1, 2021.
Home Health Value-Based Purchasing
On January 1, 2016, CMS implemented Home Health Value-Based Purchasing ("HHVBP"). The HHVBP model was designed to give Medicare-certified home health agencies incentives or penalties, through payment bonuses, to provide higher quality and more efficient care. HHVBP was rolled out to nine pilot states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Washington, seven of which Amedisys currently has home health operations. Bonuses and penalties began in 2018 with the maximum of plus or minus 3% growing to plus or minus 8% by 2022. Payment adjustments are calculated based on performance in a variety of measures which include current Quality of Patient Care and Patient Satisfaction star measures, as well as measures based on submission of data to a CMS web portal. The measures used may be subject to modification or change by CMS.
Under the demonstration, agencies with higher performance receive bonuses, while those with lower scores receive lower payments relative to current levels. Agency performance is evaluated against separate improvement and attainment scores, with payment tied to the higher of these two scores. CMS used 2015 as the baseline year for performance, with 2016 as the first year for performance measurement. The first payment adjustment began January 1, 2018, based on 2016 performance data. Between 2018 and 2022, the payment adjustments vary (upward or downward) from 3% to 8%. 
In January 2021, CMS and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation announced its intention, through rulemaking, to expand HHVBP with an implementation date no earlier than January 2022. In November 2021, CMS issued the Calendar Year 2022 Home Health Final Rule for Medicare home health providers which provides for the expansion of the HHVBP model to all 50 states beginning January 1, 2023 with calendar year 2023 being the first performance year and calendar year 2025 being the first payment year with a proposed maximum payment adjustment, up or down, of 5%. In doing so, the final payment year of the HHVBP demonstration (2022) was cancelled.
Home Health Payment Reform
On February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ("BBA of 2018"), which provided for a targeted extension of the home health rural add-on payment, a reduction of the 2020 market basket update, modification of eligibility documentation requirements and reform to the Home Health Prospective Payment System ("HHPPS"). The HHPPS reform included the following parameters: for home health units of service beginning on January 1, 2020, a 30-day payment system was to be applied; the transition to the 30-day payment system was to be budget neutral; and CMS was to conduct at least one Technical Expert Panel during 2018, prior to any notice and comment rulemaking process, related to the design of any new case-mix adjustment model.
The Calendar Year 2019 Home Health Final Rule updated the Medicare HHPPS and finalized the implementation of an alternative case-mix adjustment methodology, PDGM, which became effective on January 1, 2020. PDGM adjusted payments 
to home health agencies based on patient characteristics for 30-day periods of care and also eliminated the use of therapy visits in the determination of payments. While the changes were to be implemented in a budget neutral manner to the industry, the ultimate impact varied by provider based on factors including patient mix and admission source. Additionally, CMS made assumptions about behavioral changes which were finalized in the Calendar Year 2020 Home Health Final Rule released on October 31, 2019 and resulted in a 4.36% reduction to reimbursement. The behavioral changes were related to coding practices, low utilization payment adjustment ("LUPA") management and co-morbidities. CMS is required by law to analyze data for calendar years 2020-2026, retrospectively, to determine the impact of the difference between assumed and actual behavior changes and to make any such payment changes as are necessary to offset or supplement the adjustments based on anticipated behavior. Additionally, in an effort to eliminate fraud risks, CMS reduced the upfront payment associated with requests for anticipated payment ("RAPs") to 20% in 2020 with the full elimination of RAPs in 2021. 
Phase-Out of the Rural Add-On
The BBA of 2018 also mandated the implementation of a new methodology for applying rural add-on payments for home health services (“rural add-on”). Unlike previous rural add-ons, which were applied to all rural areas uniformly, the extension provided varying add-on amounts depending on the rural county (or equivalent area) classification by classifying each rural county (or equivalent area) into one of three distinct categories: (1) rural counties and equivalent areas in the highest quartile of all counties and equivalent areas based on the number of Medicare home health episodes furnished per 100 individuals who are entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under Part A of Medicare or enrolled for benefits under Part B of Medicare only, but not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan under Part C of Medicare (the "high utilization" category); (2) rural counties and equivalent areas with a population density of 6 individuals or fewer per square mile of land area that are not included in the "high utilization" category (the "low population density" category); and (3) rural counties and equivalent areas not in either the "high utilization" or "low population density" categories (the "all other" category).
In the Calendar Year ("CY") 2019 Home Health Final Rule, CMS finalized policies for the rural add-on payments for CY 2019 through CY 2022, in accordance with section 50208 of the BBA of 2018. The CY 2019 through CY 2022 rural add-on percentages outlined in the rule are shown in the table below.

Rural Add-On Percentages, CYs 2019-2022
Category | CY 2019 | CY 2020 | CY 2021 | CY 2022
High utilization | 1.5% | 0.5% | None | None 
Low population density | 4.0% | 3.0% | 2.0% | 1.0% 
All other | 3.0% | 2.0% | 1.0% | None 

Civil Monetary Penalties
HHS may impose civil monetary penalties ("CMP") for a variety of civil offenses related to federal health care programs. They may be imposed upon any person or entity who presents, or causes to be presented, certain ineligible claims for medical items or services, for providing improper inducements to beneficiaries to obtain services, for payments to limit services to patients, and for offenses related to relationships with excluded individuals, among other things. 
Maximum CMP amounts have been increased significantly as a result of the BBA of 2018. The maximum CMP has increased to $105,563 for knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider or supplier and to $59,527 for making or using a false record or statement that is material to a false or fraudulent claim. 
Environmental and Climate Change Matters
We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk. We have adopted an integrated approach to address climate change, with cross-disciplinary teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives and policies. Strategies and progress toward our goals are reviewed with senior leadership and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. We have committed to engage a third party expert by December 31, 2022 to help collect data and measure greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and will establish interim GHG targets covering scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C emissions reduction goal and report all Scope 3 emissions and a timeline for establishing Scope 3 GHG reduction targets by December 31, 2023. Additional information about our environmental and climate change related goals will be included in our inaugural sustainability report, which we expect to publish in 2022 and will be available on our website. For more information regarding climate change and its possible adverse impact on us, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Operations — Our operations could be impacted by natural disasters and climate change” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Competitors
There are few barriers to entry in the home health and hospice jurisdictions that do not require a CON or POA. Our primary competition in these jurisdictions comes from local privately and publicly-owned and hospital-owned health care providers. We compete based on the quality of services, the availability of personnel, expertise of visiting staff, and, in certain instances, on the price of our services. In addition, we compete with a number of non-profit organizations that finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us.
