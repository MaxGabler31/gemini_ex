ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a leading provider of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions for the way employees communicate and collaborate in business. We believe that our innovative, cloud-based approach disrupts the large market for business communications and collaboration by providing flexible and cost-effective solutions that support distributed workforces, mobile employees and the proliferation of smart phones and tablets. We enable convenient and effective communications for our customers, across all their locations, all their employees, all the time, thus enabling them to be more productive and more responsive to their customers.
 The world of business communications has changed dramatically with the introduction of smartphones and tablets. Traditionally, business communications have been comprised of a series of inflexible, expensive, and disparate systems: on-premise hardware based private branch exchanges (“PBX systems”) which primarily support only voice on desktop phones. The rapid growth of mobile communications changed the way businesses interact. Employees connect from anywhere with any device. They use multiple modes of communications including voice, video, text, and messaging. These forms of flexible communications enable employees to be productive in ways on-premise systems do not support. In addition, software applications delivery has evolved into cloud based SaaS solutions. Being location and device independent, cloud based delivery is better suited to address the needs of modern mobile and global enterprise workforces that are hard, if not impossible, for legacy on-premise systems to match.
 We believe RingCentral benefits from both the shift to mobile and distributed workforces and the migration of hardware on-premise based communication systems to cloud based software solutions. RingCentral’s software cloud communications platform is designed from the ground-up, specifically for today’s mobile and distributed workforce. We offer a leading collaborative communications suite that unifies the way employees communicate through mobile and desktop devices using audio, video, text messaging, web conferencing, and contact center. In addition, our differentiated open platform Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) enable seamless integration with standard and customer software applications, examples of which are available at apps.ringcentral.com. These integrations improve business workflows resulting in higher employee productivity. Our global delivery capabilities support the needs of multi-national enterprises in multiple countries.
 We primarily generate revenues from the sale of software subscriptions for our cloud-based services. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through adding additional users, upselling current customers to premium subscription editions, and providing additional features and functionality. We market and sell our subscriptions to customers through our direct sales force, indirectly through channel partners and carriers and through both our website and inside sales teams. Our indirect channel partners include regional and global master agents such as Intelisys Communications, Inc. (acquired by ScanSource, Inc.), Ingram Micro Inc. (acquired by HNA Group), Sandler Partners, and AVANT, Inc.; national partners such as CDW Corporation, Carousel Industries, and SHI International Corp.; strategic partners such as Alphabet Inc. (the parent company of Google Inc.); and carrier partners including TELUS Communications Company (“TELUS”) and BT Group plc (“BT”), which we refer to collectively as resellers. Our network of resellers includes master agents who manage other sales agents and resellers, resulting in an even larger reseller network.

We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trade names or trademarks to imply an endorsement or sponsorship of us by such companies, or any relationship with any of these companies.
 Our Solutions 
 Our cloud-based business communications and collaboration solutions provide a single user identity across multiple locations and devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones, and allow for communication across multiple modes, including high-definition (“HD”) voice, video, SMS, messaging and collaboration, conferencing, online meetings, and fax. Our proprietary solutions enable a more productive and dynamic workforce, and are architected using industry standards to meet modern business communications and collaboration requirements, including workforce mobility, “bring-your-own” communications device environments and multiple communications methods. 
 Our solutions are delivered using a highly available, and rapidly and easily scalable infrastructure, allowing our customers to add new users regardless of where they are located. Our solutions are generally affordable, requiring little to no upfront infrastructure hardware costs or ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs commonly associated with on-premise systems and can be integrated with other existing communication systems. RingCentral Office, our flagship offering, is a multi-tenant, multi-location, enterprise-grade communications and collaboration solution. We also offer RingCentral Professional, primarily an inbound call routing subscription with additional text and fax capabilities targeting smaller deployments; RingCentral Fax, an Internet fax subscription that permits sending and receiving faxes over the Internet; RingCentral Contact Center, an integrated and automated communications solution that improves communications between a business and its customers; RingCentral Glip, a team messaging and collaboration tool that allows teams to share tasks, files, and more; Rooms and Rooms Connector, to bring a cloud video conferencing solution to meeting

rooms; RingCentral Webinar, a tool capable of hosting up to 10,000 attendees and 200 presenters; and RingCentral Live Reports, a solution that enables RingCentral Office customers to monitor in real time the service quality delivered to their customers.
 We believe that our solutions go beyond the core functionality of existing on-premise communications solutions by providing additional key benefits that address the changing requirements of business to allow business communications using voice, SMS, team messaging, collaboration, fax, and HD video web conferencing. The key benefits of our solutions include: 
  
• | Location Independence. Our cloud-based solutions are designed to be location independent. We seamlessly connect distributed and mobile users, enabling employees to communicate with a single identity whether working from a central location, a branch office, on the road, or at home. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global. Our RingCentral Global Office capabilities support multinational enterprise workforces. RingCentral Global Office connects multinational workforces globally, while reducing the complexity and high costs of maintaining multiple, legacy on-premise PBX systems with a single global cloud solution. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Device Independence. Our solutions are designed to work with a broad range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs, and desk phones, enabling businesses to successfully implement a “bring-your-own” communications device strategy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Instant Activation and Easy Account Management. Our solutions are designed for rapid deployment and ease of management. Our intuitive graphical user interfaces allow administrators and users to set up and manage their business communications system with little or no IT expertise, training, or dedicated staffing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability. Our cloud-based solutions scale easily and efficiently with the growth of our customers. Customers can add users, regardless of their location, without having to purchase additional infrastructure hardware or software upgrades. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower Cost of Ownership. We believe that our customers experience significantly lower cost of ownership compared to legacy on-premise systems. Using our cloud-based solutions, our customers can avoid the significant upfront costs of infrastructure hardware, software, ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs, and the need for dedicated and trained IT personnel to support these systems. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seamless and Intuitive Integration with Other Applications. Applications are proliferating within businesses of all sizes. Integration of these business applications with legacy on-premise systems is typically complex and expensive, which limits the ability of businesses to leverage cloud-based applications. Our platform provides seamless and intuitive integration with multiple popular cloud-based business applications such as Office365, Google GSuite, Salesforce CRM, Oracle, Okta, Zendesk, and Box, as well as customer lines-of business applications.

• | Mobile-Centric Approach. Our solution includes smartphone and tablet mobile applications that customers can use to set up and manage company, department, and user settings from anywhere. Our applications turn iOS and Android smartphones and tablets into business communication devices. Users can change their personal settings instantly and communicate via voice, text, team messaging and collaboration, HD video and web conferencing, and fax. Personal mobile devices are fully integrated into the customer’s cloud-based communication solution, using the company’s numbers, and displaying one of the company’s caller ID for calls made through our mobile applications. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By eliminating the need for multiple business numbers, users are able to easily control how, when, and where they conduct their business communications through routing logic with one number. Employees can stay connected, thus increasing efficiency, productivity, and responsiveness to their customers. Having one business number also enables users to keep personal mobile numbers private. We introduced Rooms and Rooms Connector to bring a cloud web conferencing solution to meeting rooms, support for large meetings up to 500 attendees, and Webinars up to 10,000 attendees for a monthly per license add-on fee.

 Our Customers 
 We have a diverse and growing customer base across a wide range of industries, including financial services, healthcare, legal services, real estate, retail, technology, insurance, construction, hospitality, and state and local government, among others. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, AT&T, one of our resellers, accounted for 11%, 14%, and 13% of our total revenues and 12%, 13%, and 12% of our software subscription revenues, respectively. In January 2018, we acquired from AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”) the existing customer base of the RingCentral Office@Hand solution sold by AT&T. The transitioning of these customers to RingCentral Office has commenced and is expected to be completed over the next twelve months. AT&T no longer sells new subscriptions for our solutions. 
 Prior to 2014, we focused our principal efforts on the market for small- and medium-sized businesses, defined by IDC as less than 1,000 employees, in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). In 2014, we began targeting larger customers through our product development and marketing, and sales and support teams, and in 2015, we began selling to enterprise customers. We continuously expand our product offering globally and believe that there are additional growth opportunities in international markets. 
 Marketing, Sales and Support 
 We use a variety of marketing, sales, and support activities to generate and cultivate ongoing customer demand for our subscriptions, acquire new customers, and engage with our existing customers. We sell through both direct and indirect channels. We provide on-boarding implementation support to help our customers set up and configure their newly purchased communications system, as well as ongoing self-service, phone support, online chat support, and training. We also closely track and monitor customer acquisition costs to assess how we are deploying our marketing, sales, and customer support spending. 

• | Marketing. Our marketing efforts include search engine marketing, search engine optimization, affiliates, list buys, shared leads, content leads, appointment setting, radio advertising, online display advertising, billboard advertising, tradeshows and events, and other forms of demand generation. We track and measure our marketing costs closely across all channels so that we can acquire customers in a cost-efficient manner. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct Sales. We primarily sell our products and software subscriptions through direct inbound and outbound sales efforts. We have direct sales representatives located in the U.S. and internationally. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Indirect Sales. Our indirect sales channel consists of a network of sales agents and channel partners who are active in selling our solutions and with whom we have direct relationships, including our carrier partners TELUS and BT, which help broaden the adoption of our subscriptions without the need for a large direct field sales force. Our network of resellers includes master agents who manage other sales agents and resellers, resulting in an even larger reseller network. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Support. While our intuitive and easy-to-use user interface serves to reduce our customers’ need for support, we provide online chat and phone customer support, as well as post-sale implementation support, as an option to help customers configure and use our solution. We track and measure our customer satisfaction and our support costs closely across all channels to provide a high level of customer service in a cost-efficient manner. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development 
 We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to expanding our leadership position within the cloud-based business communications solutions market. We devote the majority of our research and development resources to software development. Our engineering team has significant experience in various disciplines related to our platform, such as voice, text, team messaging and collaboration, video and fax processing, mobile application development, IP networking and infrastructure, user experience, security, and robust multi-tenant cloud-based system architecture. 
 Our development methodology, in combination with our SaaS delivery model, allows us to provide new and enhanced capabilities on a regular basis. Based on feedback from our customers and prospects and our review of the broader business communications and SaaS markets, we continuously develop new functionality while maintaining and enhancing our existing solution. We typically have multiple releases per year, where we constantly improve our product and introduce new capabilities and features to make our customers’ workforce more productive and to build out the feature set required by larger and global enterprises.

Our research and development expenses were $75.1 million, $65.5 million, and $52.9 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
 Technology and Operations 
 Our platform is built on a highly scalable and flexible infrastructure comprised of commercially available hardware and software components. We believe that both hardware and software components of our platform can be replaced, upgraded or added with minimal or no interruption in service. The system is designed to have no single point-of-failure. 
 We host our products and serve our customers from 17 data centers. In North America we have two third-party U.S. based data center facilities in San Jose, California and Vienna, Virginia, and we host our products and serve our customers in the U.K. and other European countries from two third-party data center hosting 
facilities in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Zurich, Switzerland. Our collaboration solution, RingCentral Glip, is hosted by Amazon Web Services, Inc. We also maintain seven additional U.S. based data center facilities for media processing public switched telephone networks (“PSTN”) interconnect. Additionally, we use third-party co-location facilities in the U.K., Singapore, Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Japan to facilitate local media processing in these regions. Our data centers are designed to host mission-critical computer and communications systems with redundant, fault-tolerant subsystems, and compartmentalized security zones. We maintain a security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to our customers’ data. We limit access to on-demand servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities. 
 We serve North American customers out of two Points of Presence, known as POPs, one in San Jose, California and the other in Vienna, Virginia. RingCentral subscribers are divided into Parts of Data (“PODs”) each comprised of two symmetrical, synchronized units. POPs and PODs are redundant with switchover and failover capabilities between POPs. In addition to the symmetric PODs and POPs, we have also deployed POPs in the U.K., Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Japan, which serve as an extension of our architecture to help facilitate local media processing for global customers while maintaining core services and data in our POPs in North America and Europe. This architecture enables us to deliver our subscriptions in a scalable and reliable manner. We can manage our customer growth by adding additional PODs and POPs into our delivery infrastructure as required. We leverage third-party network service providers, including CenturyLink, Inc., Bandwidth.com, Inc., and AT&T, for network connectivity. We also obtain connectivity and network services in certain regions from our subsidiary, RCLEC, Inc. (“RCLEC”).
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
 Our intellectual property portfolio includes 135 issued U.S. utility patents, which expire between 2026 and 2037. We also have 39 patent applications pending examination in the U.S. and 15 patent applications pending examination in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are related to U.S. applications. In general, our patents and patent applications apply to certain aspects of our SaaS and mobile applications and underlying communications infrastructure. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties that typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our products and software subscriptions. 
 Competition 
 The market for business communications solutions is very large, rapidly evolving, complex, fragmented and defined by changing technology, and customer needs. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

• | subscription features and capabilities;
--+----------------------------------------


• | system reliability, availability, and performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | speed and ease of activation, setup, and configuration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | ownership and control of the underlying technology;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | integration with mobile devices;
--+---------------------------------

 9


 
• | brand awareness and recognition;
--+---------------------------------


• | simplicity of the pricing model; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership.
--+-------------------------

 We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. 
 We face competition from a broad range of providers of business communications solutions. Some of these competitors include: 
  
• | traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Mitel Networks Corporation, and Siemens Enterprise Networks, LLC, any of which may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | software providers such as Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Teams (formerly Skype for Business)) and BroadSoft, Inc. (which recently announced an agreement to be acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc.) that generally license their software and may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud, and their resellers including major carriers and cable companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established communications providers that resell on-premise hardware, software, and hosted solutions, such as AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc., and Comcast Corporation in the United States, TELUS and others in Canada, and BT, Vodafone, and others in the U.K., all of whom have significantly greater resources than us and do now or may in the future also develop and/or host their own or other solutions through the cloud;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other cloud companies such as 8x8, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., DialPad, Inc., Fuze (formerly Thinking Phone Networks), StarBlue (merger of Star2Star and BlueFace), Intermedia.net, Inc., J2 Global, Inc., Jive Communications, Inc. (which recently announced an agreement to be acquired by LogMeIn, Inc.), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Teams (formerly Skype for Business)), Nextiva, Inc., Slack Technologies, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., and West Corporation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other large internet companies such as Alphabet Inc., Facebook, Inc., Oracle Corporation, and Salesforce.com, Inc., any of which might launch its own cloud-based business communication services or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established contact center providers such as Amazon.com, Inc., Aspect Software, Inc., Avaya Inc., Five9, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., Interactive Intelligence, Inc. (acquired by Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc.), and NewVoiceMedia.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees and Contractors
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,352 full-time employees, including 317 in research and development, 644 in sales and marketing, 195 in operations, and 196 in general and administrative. As of such date, we had 1,081 employees located in the U.S. and 271 internationally, including 195 in China. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good and we have never experienced any work stoppages. 
 We also contract with third-party contractors whose employees or subcontractors’ employees perform services for us. We refer to our third-party contractors’ employees and subcontractors’ employees as our contractors. As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,946 of these contractors, including 538 in research and development, 545 in sales and marketing, 630 in operations, and 233 in general and administrative. As of such date, we had 56 contractors located in the U.S. and 1,890 internationally, including 1,200 in the Philippines and 690 in Russia and Ukraine. 
 Regulatory 
 As a provider of Internet communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund, and federal programs related to phone number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services. In addition, we have certified a wholly owned subsidiary as a competitive local exchange carrier in thirty-four states and currently intend to obtain certificates for our subsidiary in additional states. This subsidiary, RCLEC, is subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commissions in states where the subsidiary provides services. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement for our subsidiary to register or seek certification to provide its services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements.

As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our subscriptions. Regulatory treatment of Internet communications services outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than imposed on our subscriptions in the U.S. In the United Kingdom, for example, our subscriptions are regulated by Ofcom, which, among other things, requires electronic communications providers such as our company to provide all users access to both 112 (EU-mandated) and 999 (U.K.-mandated) emergency service numbers at no charge. Similarly in Canada, our subscriptions are regulated by the CRTC, which, among other things, imposes requirements similar to the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the wireline incumbent carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on the use of our subscriptions in international locations. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” for more information.
