​
Industry Background
​
Conventional manufacturing processes have numerous shortcomings.
Historically, processes such as casting, stamping, molding and machining have dominated global manufacturing, which is a $12 trillion industry, according to estimates by A.T. Kearney. These conventional and subtractive manufacturing techniques have 

4



numerous limitations. Most require high upfront expenses in the form of tools, such as molds, dies, jigs or fixtures. Designing and manufacturing these tools can result in long lead times for parts as well as minimum volume requirements in order to achieve cost efficiencies. 
Tooling requirements associated with casting, stamping, and injection molding also leave little room for design iteration without increasing time-to-market and development costs. New parts and design changes often require a new tool, thereby slowing the pace at which businesses can introduce new products and react to shifts in market preferences and making it difficult to compete effectively. Computer numerical controlled machining, or CNC machining, is an alternative to stamping, casting and molding that does not require a mold or die, enabling lower-volume production with reduced lead times. However, because CNC machining is a subtractive process in which material is removed from a solid block to create a part, it typically results in higher part costs and significant material waste. In addition, the CNC machining process often requires heavy involvement from specialist technicians, and machine programming can be time intensive. Each of these conventional manufacturing processes also creates design restrictions that can result in significantly higher part weights and costs or require assemblies, adversely impacting performance in favor of manufacturability and driving additional manufacturing and supply chain complexity.
Additive manufacturing has the potential to address the limitations of conventional manufacturing.
Additive manufacturing addresses many of the limitations of conventional manufacturing through a combination of flexibility, ease of use and cost, making it an efficient and effective process across the product life cycle, from design and prototyping to production. Additive manufacturing is a digital manufacturing process that produces 3D objects from digital models through the repeated deposition of thin layers of material. This process eliminates the need for tooling inputs and provides a range of benefits including:

• | Accelerated time-to-market. Businesses can manufacture design files at the push of a button with no tooling required. While design cycles for conventional manufacturing can take weeks or months, additive manufacturing can shorten this cycle to days due to the ability to rapidly switch between or iterate on designs without excessive delay. Such improvements in time-to-market for new products can help businesses react more rapidly to shifts in customer demand. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design flexibility. Conventional manufacturing can force design compromises as a result of subtractive manufacturing processes or the use of tools. While 3D printing may involve design guidelines primarily to reduce dependency on supports and optimize process success, designers generally have freedom to produce geometries not possible or economically feasible with conventional manufacturing. As an example, with additive manufacturing, designers can produce intricate organic or complex, lattice shapes that are optimized for strength and functional performance to reduce weight and material usage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assembly consolidation. Improved design flexibility enables the consolidation of sub-assemblies into single parts, which can improve reliability by reducing the number of failure points in a product. Decreasing part quantity is also a productivity breakthrough for many businesses. With fewer unique parts to fabricate, procure, store and assemble, businesses can drastically simplify their supply chains. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mass customization. Additive manufacturing enables the customization and production of designs at scale, eliminating costs traditionally associated with multiple tools and tooling changeover as well as reducing the risk of excess inventory and material obsolescence. Each part printed using additive manufacturing can be identical to or radically different from the other parts within a given print. Several end markets, including audiology and dental, have already leveraged mass customization through additive manufacturing to improve the aesthetics and performance of parts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply chain re-engineering. Additive manufacturing suitable for end-use parts production can improve supply chains by enabling on-demand manufacturing in distributed locations. Decentralized networks of additive manufacturing systems with low tooling and set-up costs can replace centralized facilities with conventional manufacturing equipment in locations frequently selected because of lower cost of labor. In addition, producing parts near the point and time of demand can significantly reduce lead times, inventories, and dependencies on forecasting without incurring additional costs related to logistics and customs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustainable manufacturing. Additive manufacturing is a more efficient production process than subtractive techniques, such as CNC machining. It requires fewer material inputs and reduces material waste. By enabling optimized geometries

lighter than conventionally manufactured counterparts, additive manufacturing can also lead to downstream sustainability benefits, including reduced fuel consumption in industries such as automotive and aerospace. In addition, by reducing supply chain complexity, additive manufacturing can reduce emissions from transporting physical goods around the world.
Many businesses are motivated to deploy additive manufacturing to improve production processes at-scale.
Many businesses faced with increased global competition and rapidly changing market preferences are turning to additive manufacturing to overcome the limitations of conventional manufacturing and provide a competitive advantage. According to an Ernst & Young global survey, 83% of industrial businesses in 2019 were either already applying or considering applying additive manufacturing technologies, a significant increase from 36% in 2016. According to the Wohlers Report 2021, spending on additive manufacturing products and services roughly doubled from $6 billion to $12 billion during this same period. While many businesses still value the rapid prototyping benefits of additive manufacturing, they are also eager to realize benefits largely related to end-use part production. According to Ernst & Young, over 50% of industrial businesses expect to use additive manufacturing to produce products that better meet customer requirements; reduce logistics efforts, transport and inventories; and manufacture existing products at lower costs.
Most existing additive manufacturing technologies primarily focus on design & prototyping applications.
Additive manufacturing technologies face stringent business requirements for use in production with respect to accuracy, surface finish, material properties and throughput, all of which must meet or exceed the standards set by more mature conventional manufacturing alternatives. Most commercially available 3D printers leverage legacy additive manufacturing technologies including fused filament fabrication, or FFF, stereolithography, or SLA, and powder bed fusion, or PBF. These first-generation 3D printing technologies build parts by tracing each layer using a single point or multiple points, such as an extrusion nozzle in FFF printers or a laser in SLA and PBF systems. While these technologies have evolved significantly since the early 2000s, and have mostly overcome initial deficiencies around accuracy, surface finish and material properties, their throughput and the resulting production economics have continued to present a challenge. Such technologies can typically only increase part throughput with additional time or systems, which limits customers’ ability to increase production without also increasing their equipment costs. Many existing additive manufacturing solutions consequently continue to focus on design and prototyping use cases or other low volume production applications where design flexibility and turnaround time are important to customers, but costs and part throughput are not, and where other key performance measures, including accuracy, surface finish and material properties are also less critical.
As a result, businesses still face hurdles in adopting legacy additive manufacturing for end-use production.
While the growth of additive manufacturing has accelerated in recent years, many companies still hesitate to fully adopt the existing, legacy technologies to produce end-use parts in volume, preventing them from realizing the full benefits of additive manufacturing. Ernst & Young found that only 18% of industrial businesses in 2019 used additive manufacturing for end-use parts, lagging other use cases such as rapid prototyping. Because these existing, legacy technologies are better suited to design and prototyping applications, businesses pursuing additive manufacturing solutions face significant barriers to adopting these technologies for end-use applications. Using legacy additive manufacturing technologies to make end-use parts can be expensive, particularly for businesses under margin pressure. This is due to the high costs of legacy additive manufacturing equipment and related consumable materials, which are often priced at high levels by vendors to compensate for the low productivity of their systems. When combined with the limited throughput of these legacy additive manufacturing technologies, high upfront and operating costs result in part costs that typically cannot compete with conventional manufacturing. Consequently, industries that require inexpensive parts in large quantities, such as automotive and consumer products, face challenges in adopting additive manufacturing for end-use parts production.
​

As a result, we believe we are at the forefront of the next generation of companies that will drive the accelerated adoption of Additive Manufacturing 2.0, whereas legacy additive manufacturing technologies are primarily focused on enabling rapid prototyping and tooling applications. According to the Wohlers Report 2021 and management estimates, this market is expected grow from $13 billion in 2020 to more than $100 billion in 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%, as additive manufacturing displaces conventional manufacturing across a growing range of applications.
​
Our Growth Strategy
​
The key elements of our strategy for growth include the following:
Expand our product offerings with a focus on integrated solutions that make additive manufacturing suitable for production applications and accessible to a broad audience.
We believe the adoption of additive manufacturing, particularly for end-use parts, is driven by the availability of solutions that offer a tool-free, digital path to producing large quantities of parts that are both higher performance and lower cost than achievable through conventional manufacturing processes. Our product portfolio is focused on additive manufacturing printer platforms designed for Additive Manufacturing 2.0, or the volume production of end-use parts, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in enhancing these solutions and developing technologies with breakthrough advances in print speed and other process parameters to deliver the highest throughput systems and lowest part costs in the additive manufacturing market. We believe such improvements will encourage customer investment in additive manufacturing across a range of industrial applications and vertical markets where conventional manufacturing has customarily held cost and volume advantages. Improved system productivity and economics will expand our market opportunity and enable customers to enjoy the benefits of additive manufacturing at-scale, including lighter, more sustainable parts and a digital supply chain. Our Additive Manufacturing 2.0 solutions also enable us to capture recurring revenue streams through the sales of consumables and service contracts. We are also committed to lowering the barriers to adopting such additive manufacturing solutions by providing integrated, turnkey experiences that improve performance while reducing workflow complexity and include all the software, hardware and materials required to produce end-use parts. To accomplish this, we intend to continue investing in software, materials and sintering technologies complementary to our 3D printers that enable ease of use and broad adoption across a wide set of customers with varying levels of experience with additive manufacturing.
Qualify additional materials to reach new verticals and expand our addressable market
Our current product portfolio supports 3D printing using an extensive library of materials, including metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, sands, composites, wood and biocompatible materials, and we are in the process of qualifying additional materials for printing that meet or exceed the properties achievable through conventional manufacturing processes. Our metal additive manufacturing systems are designed using sintering-based, powder metallurgy processes, for which hundreds of well-characterized metal alloys and ceramics are available, offering a broad set of materials for us to evaluate and qualify for use with these platforms. Several of these solutions also provide open platforms for customers to develop and print with specialized materials that are either proprietary to them or not included on our internal development roadmap while others offer a full, turnkey experience including metal powders which we qualify and distribute for customer use. Our photopolymer systems support a wide range of both proprietary and third-party, industry-validated resins through a selectively open business model. By developing or qualifying additional industrial materials on our systems and enabling customers and partners to do the same, we believe we can serve a broader customer base and address new applications and vertical markets, thereby expanding market share of our solutions and helping drive adoption of additive manufacturing.
Develop robust produced parts offerings focused on “killer apps” for additive manufacturing
We are establishing produced parts offerings in which we directly manufacture parts for sale to our customers with a focus on key, high-value applications and verticals in which additive manufacturing can provide significant design, performance, cost and supply chain advantages relative to conventional manufacturing. These offerings will enable us to provide a more holistic suite of solutions for our customers and enable the accelerated adoption of our Additive Manufacturing 2.0 solutions across select high-value and high margin production applications, which we refer to as “killer apps”, including, but not limited to, medical and dental devices, fluid power systems, and sustainable, end-use wood parts.

7



dental and biofabrication platform focused on leveraging our proprietary additive manufacturing solutions to vertically integrate into digital solutions, design services and parts production capabilities for dental and biofabrication applications. By leveraging additive manufacturing, we believe we can provide improved delivery timelines, higher performance parts, and a more integrated, end-to-end customer experience relative to manufacturers that leverage conventional processes, enabling pricing power and accelerating our customer acquisition capabilities. Providing produced parts also enables customers to leverage our technology for these “killer apps” with a lower initial capital expenditure investment before bringing their production in-house when they are ready to purchase our additive manufacturing systems. We believe such services will facilitate lead generation for our additive manufacturing systems at scale and enable high-performance and specialized applications using new materials ahead of broader market introduction. 
Pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships
We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and/or equity investments in businesses that represent a strategic fit and are consistent with our overall focus on technologies and solutions that enable Additive Manufacturing 2.0 across printers, materials and killer apps. We believe such transactions would allow us to accelerate market penetration of our additive manufacturing solutions by enabling expansion of our product portfolio, access to new markets and key applications for additive manufacturing, and a stronger value proposition for our customers while delivering margin improvements and increased customer lifetime value.

Our Competitive Strengths
​
We are a pioneer in the additive manufacturing industry with a mission to make the technology accessible to all designers, engineers, and manufacturers. We believe our collective expertise coupled with the following competitive strengths, will allow us to maintain and extend a leadership position in next-generation additive manufacturing and expand our market opportunity:
Differentiated and proprietary technology platform focused on area-wide print technologies
We have invested significant resources in developing proprietary technologies that serve as the foundation of our solutions across hardware, software and materials science to accelerate the widespread adoption of additive manufacturing. A majority of these proprietary technologies are innovations on binder jetting or digital light processing, or DLP, which are area-wide 3D printing processes that use inkjet printheads or DLP projectors, respectively, to print an entire layer or large sections of a layer at one time and are consequently more efficient than point processes, such as FFF, SLA and PBF, which trace each layer over time using single (or multiple) points of energy or material deposition. Several of our key print process innovations include:

• | Single Pass Jetting, or SPJ. An area-wide powder metallurgy-based process in which all the sequential steps of conventional binder jetting are combined and applied with each pass of a single print carriage over the “build box”, dramatically reducing print time and increasing mechanical efficiency, leading to significant increases in throughput and improvements in part costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Triple Advanced Compaction Technology, or Triple ACT. An area-wide powder metallurgy-based process for binder jetting that leverages a unique ultrasonic hopper in combination with a dual roller approach featuring a knurl design on one roller for spreading powder and a special surface finish on a separate roller for compacting powder, leading to high powder bed densities with minimal variability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuous Digital Light Manufacturing, or CDLM. An area-wide photopolymer printing process built on top of DLP technology that allows for continuous motion of the build plate to deliver exceptional build speeds and parts with isotropic properties and high accuracy, leading to improvements in part costs while also enabling new resin chemistries with strong functional characteristics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Projection Arrays. An area-wide photopolymer printing process that combines multiple high-resolution DLP projectors into a single exposure using advance multi-image calibration to increase power density and resolution during curing, improving print speeds and enabling large format build areas to support the production of large parts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bound Metal Deposition, or BMD. A powder metallurgy-based process in which loose powders and dangerous lasers commonly associated with 3D printing are eliminated in favor of bound metal rods to shape parts layer-by-layer, leading to reductions in requirements for special facilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Micro Automated Fiber Placement, or Micro AFP. A process in which tape pre-impregnated with continuous fiber, or continuous fiber prepreg tape, is deposited along a part’s critical load paths in combination with chopped fiber filament to build high-strength and high-resolution parts with aerospace and industrial-grade materials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to these print process innovations, we have developed purpose-built, proprietary sintering technology that delivers industrial-strength sintering in an office-friendly package as well as breakthrough sintering process simulation software, designed to facilitate metal parts production on our platforms with high accuracy while reducing trial-and-error. These fundamental technologies represent the cornerstones of our future product introductions and are critical to enhancing our existing offerings. Elements of these technologies and processes are protected by our know-how and by over 650 patents or pending patent applications.

High printer throughput
We believe that our proprietary SPJ, Triple ACT, CDLM and Projection Array technologies and each of our binder jet and DLP product platforms enables the highest rate of parts production per unit of time among competing additive manufacturing systems for a given layer resolution. The Production System P-50, which is designed to achieve print speeds of up to 12,000 cubic centimeters per hour at a 65-micron printed layer height, can enable customers to manufacture up to hundreds of thousands or even millions of parts per year using additive manufacturing, unlocking new applications due to improved part costs and enhanced design flexibility. The Xtreme 8K uses patented Projection Array technology to support printing large photopolymer parts at build speeds up to 100 times those of legacy thermoplastic FFF printers. Our additive manufacturing solutions employ additional, proprietary technology innovations as a means to overcome some of the challenges that arise with high-speed 3D printing and ensure part consistency, accuracy, and resolution. Through continued advances in underlying hardware and our own technology and processes, we believe that our products’ print speeds will continue to increase, driving down the cost of parts produced on our additive manufacturing systems. This will further differentiate our solutions from competitors while also improving our ability to compete with conventional manufacturing processes at larger quantities of parts and across a wider range of applications.
Integrated, turnkey solutions
We aim to provide our customers with easy-to-use and end-to-end, turnkey solutions for additive manufacturing without the need for additional third-party equipment. We believe our compelling user experience across our product portfolio begins with cohesive and modern software applications for efficient printer build preparation and communication with our additive manufacturing systems, which receive feature enhancements via over-the-air or offline firmware updates. For our solutions related to metal additive manufacturing, which is a complex process that involves multiple steps to go from a digital file to a metal part, we have developed a furnace using proprietary technology purpose-built to provide industrial strength, partial-pressure and vacuum-enabled sintering in an office-friendly package. Sintering is a critical step for powder metallurgy-based metal additive manufacturing processes. Our furnace enables customers of our Studio System and metal binder jetting solutions with minimal additive manufacturing experience or materials expertise to process high-density, complex metal parts entirely in-house without third-party equipment required. Similarly, we provide cleaning and curing solutions for our photopolymer additive manufacturing systems, enabling customers to fully process parts post-print to achieve exceptional material properties, resolution and accuracy. We also provide a range of proprietary and third-party consumables and materials optimized for use with our additive manufacturing systems and designed to enable high-quality parts with consistency.
Broad product portfolio and material library
Every organization has a different challenge or application that drives its consideration of additive manufacturing. We offer our customers a range of solutions spanning multiple price points, throughput levels, operating environments, and technologies to enable businesses to find the solution that solves their specific pain point and achieves their goals across an extensive library of qualified materials. Our broad product portfolio covers a spectrum of use cases, scaling with customer needs from entry-level, office-friendly additive manufacturing systems for low volume production of metal, polymer, composite or biocompatible parts to high-end, industrial additive manufacturing systems for mass production of low-cost metal, polymer, elastomer, ceramic, sand or wood parts. In addition, this portfolio eliminates the need for customers to source products for different applications from multiple third-party vendors, giving us a market advantage relative to competitors with a more limited set of solutions.
Global presence and distribution capabilities
We have developed an industry-leading global distribution network for our additive manufacturing solutions consisting of over 200 resellers covering over 65 countries around the world and within a short drive of a significant portion of worldwide manufacturing sector locations. Our resellers, who have extensive experience across digital modeling, 3D printing, and metal and polymer manufacturing processes, provide marketing, sales, application engineering, and local support services for end users across an array of vertical markets, such as healthcare and dental. They also bring an existing base of customers into which we can drive awareness of and ultimately sell our additive manufacturing solutions. Our direct sales force augments the reach of our global distribution network, serving major accounts and expanding our footprint within multinational and Fortune 500 organizations. To support both our reseller and direct sales channels, we leverage an experienced team of application engineers who help customers identify and develop compelling use cases for additive manufacturing in their organizations to drive adoption of our solutions.

​
Our Product Platforms
 ​
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated additive manufacturing solutions comprised of hardware, software, materials and services with support for metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, sands, composites, wood, and biocompatible materials. Our additive manufacturing systems, which are based on our proprietary technologies, are described below.
Metal Additive Manufacturing Systems
Our metal additive manufacturing systems are designed using sintering-based, powder metallurgy processes, in which metal powder is bound together in a printer and sintered in a furnace to form a dense metal part. Hundreds of metal alloys are available to such powder metallurgy processes, many with well-characterized and high-quality material properties.
The Production System is an industrial manufacturing platform powered by patent-pending SPJ binder jetting technology designed to be the fastest way to 3D print metal parts at scale. The Production System platform consists of two printer models, the P-1 and the P-50, enabling customers to scale from process and materials development in a smaller form factor solution to mass production of low-cost, end-use parts on the same print engine. On the Production System P-50, which commenced shipments during the first quarter of 2022, SPJ technology offers dramatic increases in print speeds up to 100 times those of legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies. This throughput is reinforced by an open material platform that allows customers to use low-cost, third-party metal injection molding, or MIM, powders. As a result, the Production System P-50 can produce high-resolution parts at costs competitive with conventional mass production techniques for quantities up to hundreds of thousands of units, addressing the needs of original equipment and third-party contract manufacturers seeking cost-effective additive manufacturing solutions. In addition, both Production System printer models feature an inert, chemically inactive processing environment, enabling support for a range of both non-reactive and reactive metals in a controlled fashion while also promoting consistent characteristics and quality across printed parts.
The Shop System platform introduces mid-volume binder jetting with rich feature detail and exceptional surface finish to the machine shop market. With the Shop System, businesses can produce serial batches of hundreds or thousands of complex, end-use metal parts in a fraction of the time and cost of conventional manufacturing and comparably priced additive manufacturing technologies. The Shop System, which can achieve build speeds up to 10 times those of legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies, also features a configurable build volume from 4 liters to 16 liters designed to scale to a customer’s desired throughput. It is an affordable, turnkey solution that facilitates the full manufacturing process from digital file to sintered metal part, and includes a powder station for part depowdering prior to sintering, closed-loop powder recycling and our proprietary furnace technology with software and profiles optimized for mid-volume production.

In addition, our broad product portfolio offers customers a variety of capabilities and price points that can scale with customer needs, and we believe that this enables us to compete across a wide range of vertical markets. It also eliminates the need for customers to source products for different applications from multiple third-party vendors, giving us a significant market advantage relative to vendors with a more limited product portfolio.
We also compete with established organizations selling conventional manufacturing solutions and services, such as casting, injection molding, forming, extrusion and CNC machining. Such businesses typically primarily address volume production applications. We believe we compete favorably against such offerings and are well-positioned to drive adoption of additive manufacturing across an expanding set of applications given the benefits our solutions provide around lead time reductions, improved design flexibility and performance, supply chain efficiencies, and part costs, which we expect to decrease over time as our technologies and system productivity improves as a result of our research and development efforts.
