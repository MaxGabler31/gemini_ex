Item 1. Business. 
Our History and Business
 
Our business is to use sustainable technology to produce energy products. TransAct Energy Corp has transitioned from its original focus of developing raw energy resources to optimizing municipal solid waste into energy resources. 
 
We formed TransAct Energy Corp. as a Nevada corporation on March 15, 2006. Although our business plan called for the securing and managing of any energy leasehold, the Company focused on securing producing and non-producing oil and gas leases in Alberta, Canada. On September 7, 2006, we acquired a one hundred percent (100%) interest in a Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease, from the province of Alberta, Canada for twelve thousand and fifty-one dollars ($12,051), the MedHat Project. We did not develop this resource. We looked to expand our holdings in Alberta through acquisitions and joint ventures for the following two years. We have since allowed this lease to lapse and moved away from this focus.

In 2008, the Company was introduced to Dr. Mory Ghomshei one of the world’s leading geothermal experts and two of his geothermal power projects in British Columbia, Canada. We worked with companies Aqua Terra Power and Aqua Terra Geothermal through the balance of 2009 on the two geothermal power projects in British Columbia. Other than lending Aqua Terra funds no formal arrangement was entered pending them securing drill permits on the two projects. 
 
These licenses lapsed under their original owners and were re-posted by the government for public tender; an Ontario corporation associated with Dr. Ghomshei acquired most of the original licences and has received drilling permits. We entered discussions with this entity in the latter half of 2011 to form a Farm-in relationship. We have put these discussions on hold pending the completion of our first waste optimization plant although we are maintaining dialogue with Dr. Ghomshei as it relates to utilizing Geothermal in the plants themselves.
 
TransAct in mid-2009 started introducing the concept of geothermal power to markets in Western and South Asia with the plan to enter joint venture relationships to develop geothermal power projects in these areas. To enter these markets as a power producer the Company found it strategic to develop traditional carbon fueled power projects in addition. After discussions with Spectrum Energy Project Investments (a UAE power company), submitted applications to the Basra Investment Commission to develop/manage three natural gas power plants. These multi-billion-dollar projects came with long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) and sovereign guarantees and our application through Spectrum was shortlisted. We were unsuccessful in completing our acquisition of 50% of Spectrum and the initial offering lapsed. 
 
On August 31, 2009, TransAct Energy completed and closed its initial public offering at twenty-five cents ($0.25) per share selling one million one hundred and two thousand shares (1,102,000) for a total capital raise of two-hundred and seventy-four thousand three hundred and ninety-eight dollars ($274,398 USD). The majority of these funds were placed with Aqua Terra Power as convertible notes to secure and develop the four (4) geothermal licenses in British Columbia, Canada; the balance was used to pay the costs of the offering and a small amount went to working capital. The Company was approved for listing on the OTCBB in December 2009 and received the trading symbol “TEGY.” 
 
Throughout 2010 we laid the ground work for large power projects in South Europe, Asia and Africa; smaller projects for solar, waste to energy and hydrogen fuel cells specifically in India. We worked to secure markets for geothermal, new solar photo-voltaic, waste to energy and hydrogen fuel cell generators. 
 
Joint development agreement negotiations took place in December 2010 clearing the way for Transact to enter one major project in South East Asia in 2011. The 2011 year was frustrated with the company’s inability to collect raised or earned funds into the company’s bank account. Thus projects, joint ventures and previous efforts were postponed or lost permanently. While we did maintain the company’s trading status the year was taken up with collection efforts and supporting business relationships while in limbo. We did initiate discussions on new waste to energy technologies to leverage the work we had done previously in this sector.
 
The Company’s 2012 efforts were focused on building out a Waste Optimization division. We completed a Business Plan for this division and entered a Joint Development Agreement with the owners of a small scale, proprietary, zero emissions waste optimization plant (“ZEWOPtm”) that had been operating a 20 tonne per day plant for two years. We reconnected with clients in India and Brazil for future waste optimization opportunities. From the second quarter, through to the end of 2012 we worked to raise the necessary funds to build a municipal scale plant (500+ tonnes per day) in Scotland. 
 
2013 continued as a building year for both the company and its Waste Optimization division. We completed the acquisition of the ZEWOPtm technology from the Scottish Inventor and brought him on as a long-term member of our team. We successfully negotiated a relationship with the international firm Fichtner Consulting Engineers to complete the certification of our plants going forward. We identified suppliers of waste for the proposed United Kingdom plants, initiated the relationships for the uptake of the Natural Gas and Electricity in the United Kingdom and tentatively sourced the capital required for the first plant in the United Kingdom. Globally we negotiated the intent to build a plant in Mexico that includes the required equity and waste. In Brazil, we initiated a relationship to create a green energy fund in order to grow both the market in Brazil and the other strategic areas of South America. Initial talks have taken place with potential development partners for a few of the major Brazil markets pending the success of the Mexico plant. 
 
Throughout 2014 TransAct worked to finalize the engineering review and agreements necessary to develop the first ZEWOPtm in Puebla, Mexico. The plant under design is capable of processing 1320 metric tons per day of Municipal Solid Waste (“MSW”) and is estimated to cost approximately three hundred million dollars. In late November Fichtner Consulting Engineers reported they believed the ZEWOPtm could process the MSW 100% into useable products without emissions. The Fichtner report provided TransAct the opportunity to submit the Waste Supply Agreement to the Municipality of Puebla, prepare off-take agreements for interested buyers of the ZEWOPtm products and formalize the share purchase agreement with the Puebla Waste Consortium (“PWC”). PWC intended on providing 30% of the capital required to build the ZEWOPtm, while TransAct negotiates third party lenders for the remaining 70% of the cost through debt instruments.

The Company delivered the results of the Fichtner Report to the Puebla City Staff in December of 2014. The cost of the plant was more than originally discussed because it included garbage pre-processing and their waste contained more water. This affected the required equity and although it was never stated appears to be cause of the PWC hesitation. We also found out subsequently there was legal wrangling and back room negotiations between the existing MSW concession holders and the municipal/state government, affecting their ability to sign with us. After 6 months with no movement forward for the MSW feedstock from the City of Puebla, Management set out in 2015 to secure an alternate source of MSW. The agreement we had with the Puebla Waste Consortium was terminated however the sales efforts were all to National/International companies whose interest in our products will not change with a change in location. The one hundred-million-dollar equity for the plant in Puebla disappeared with the termination of the consortium contract. An alternative source of the plant equity is being sought during 2015/16 with a variety of investors coming forward during this period. As soon as we finalize the feed-stock and sales contracts we will seek to formalize the required equity.
 
Because of the specialized nature of many of the ZEWOPtm components, we initiated some of the equipment procurement; thus, we entered a design/supply agreement for our proprietary reactors with a specialized engineering firm. 
 
2014 saw the Company form subsidiary corporations in Ireland and Mexico. In Ireland we established the wholly owned subsidiary “TransAct Energy Global Limited”, this company will in turn wholly own each national subsidiary. The first national subsidiary of TransAct Global is “TransAct Energy Mexico S.DE R.L. DE C.V.” which will own a majority shareholding of each holding company that owns a ZEWOPtm like the Mexican corporation “Puebla ZEWOP 1, S. DE R.L. DE C.V.”. 
 
At the beginning of 2015 we focused on finalizing the sale of the anticipated ZEWOPtm products. These efforts included getting signed letters of intent from qualified buyers and preparing formal legal agreements for the same. We now have letters of intent from multiple qualified buyers for all the expected product and agreements ready to be signed subject to finalizing our feed-stock agreement (Waste Supply Agreement) for the first plant. 
 
In summary 2015’s efforts focused on completing the due-diligence for the Mexican candidate feed-stocks including matching equity partners and buyers of the resulting products. To that end we now have several feed-stock agreements to negotiate through to a final agreement or dismiss depending on the outcome of the negotiations. The potential equity partners have been identified subject to finalizing the feed-stock agreement and pre-sales of the future products. The clients that signed letters of intent for the products have also been briefed on the potential feed-stock cities to re-confirm their commitment. Every effort was made during the year to keep the candidate banks for debt financing informed of our progress and they appear to be continuing with their support. 
 
2016 we focused on finalizing contracts for the required MSW feed-stock. The results were a signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a private contractor in Mexico City and a municipality outside of Asuncion, Paraguay; a letter of invitation from the Republic of Panama; and a formal proposal to a municipality in the State of Jalisco, Mexico now awaiting the formal request for proposal coming in 2017. The Mexico City MOU, was followed in December 2016 with a Waste Supply Agreement. Each opportunity was negotiated to satisfy our need for thirteen-hundred and twenty metric tons per day of MSW feed-stock per ZEWOPtm. 
 
2017 was Transacts breakthrough year as it finally secured the required feedstock under long-term contract for its first ZEWOPtm to be in Mexico’s second largest city Guadalajara. We immediately secured a strategically located industrial site in El Salto and have proceeded to pre-sell the products from the future ZEWOPtm.
 
In 2018 we focused on completing the due diligence for the El Salto site, the pre-development capital required to pay for the building-site and the completion of all preliminary design work required to secure an EPC Contractor (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) through the tender process to build the ZEWOPtm. Due diligence was completed proving the site suitable for our proposed use and the land owners have so far continued to wait for us to close on the site. The pre-development capital was committed to as a bridge-loan, but to date has not been received.

Business Strategy
 
TransAct Energy Corp. has elected to focus entirely on the global development and dissemination of its 
ZEWOPtm. The ZEWOPtm makes ecological, economic, cultural, and social sense. Becoming an engine that supports the circular economy in any community it enters, sustainably. Municipalities can now be paid instead of paying to manage their MSW. In the process TransAct is able to incorporate many of the energy technologies it has worked on including, geothermal and solar. 
 
It is our intent during the eighteen-months that it should take to construct the first municipal scale ZEWOPtm to debug any mechanical/operational issues of the design. After the first building is complete (approximately one-year in), we will secure the second site in Guadalajara and start its construction so as soon as the first plant is certified operational, we will complete the assembly of the second ZEWOPtm to perfect the project management process, creating a cookie cutter approach to ZEWOPtm erection. 
 
The development of the first two ZEWOPtm give us the opportunity to recruit and train project managers capable of managing with our EPC contractors the development of each new ZEWOPtm. Focusing on stream lining the supply chain of required materials and equipment. 
 
During the estimated twenty-four to 30 months it will take to get the first two ZEWOPtm underway, we intend on imbedding a team in Europe to secure feed-stock and development sites for the next twenty ZEWOPtm. This approach will be continued around the globe, selecting major markets that are politically and economically ready to adopt our approach to waste optimization. Provided that early in 2019 we secure the funds required for the El Salto, ZEWOPtm in our bank accounts as planned, our pre-described timeline will start. 
 
With a firm start date and location of the first ZEWOPtm TransAct Energy Mexico can proceed to finalize long-term offtake agreements. Then we will reengage Fichtner Consulting Engineers to prepare working drawings, that while being approved under permits and permissions will go to tender for a guaranteed procurement and construction contract. When these steps are completed, we intend on finalizing the financing commitments. 
 
TransAct intends on establishing the manufacturing of our proprietary reactors in Mexico in 2018. We have already initiated discussions for a joint venture agreement with an ISO 9001 and ASME capable manufacturer. Our facility would supply the demand for both Mexico, South America, Central America, Canada and the USA. 
 
Z.E.W.O.P. TM can demonstrate to Mexico and the World a municipal scale solution to managing waste without emissions and land filling. Although we have been approached to build in the other North American cities we feel the market is best approached when the first Z.E.W.O.P. TM is fully operational to garner government agency support. This will insure a smoother entry into the other North American markets, once we break ground we will make sure major municipalities throughout the US and Canada are aware of our process so we get on the technology review lists.
 
Besides finding capital for individual projects, until the first revenues from operations come in, our corporate operations will continue to be funded by raising money through private placements or public offerings. We anticipate bringing on an expanded management team to oversee our operational growth throughout this year and plan to raise additional capital as required.

Markets and Customers
 
The markets for “waste optimization”, the complete processing of waste into useable products/commodities without emissions or land-filling are global. Countries around the world are adopting standards that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are promoting better use of resources, ultimately seeking freedom from foreign petroleum. The TransAct ZEWOPtm provides these markets with an emissions free solution utilizing their waste and turning it into products, including fuels that can be used in these domestic markets. 
 
We have had discussions and or contract negotiations with entities in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and USA. Europe is the most advanced market with legislation in place targeting zero-landfills, zero-emissions within a few short years. The current ZEWOPtm design for mass production has a plant size processing capacity of approximately 1320 tonnes per day of raw municipal solid waste (based on 2 Kgs per day per person, approximately 660,000 people in North America slightly less in Europe). 
 
Our target service customers are corporations or municipalities with municipal solid waste, plastic, tires or medical waste as these are the most profitable waste streams. However we can process any carbon based waste stream including sewage and agricultural. 
 
Our target ZEWOPtm product customers include airlines, shipping companies, bus companies, trucking companies or fuel retailers requiring direct blend green fuels to meet legislated targets. The EU 20/20 legislation started on January 1st of 2025, requires a 20% green fuel blend by 2020. It creates customers needing a green fuel that can blend with existing refined fuels. Any airplane or ship landing in the EU will need 15% of its fuel to be green starting 2015 we anticipate being able to use our fuels going forward in this capacity upon EU certification. Our customers also include friction product manufacturers (brake pads, clutch plates, sanding disks) and wood product manufacturers (plywood, particle board, OSB etc.) that utilize phenol resins in their manufacturing process. We target manufacturers of biodegradable plastics and pharmaceuticals for our Levoglucosan. Tire and rubber manufacturers, lithographers and printers requiring high quality carbon black are customers. Waxes for the cosmetic industry, paraffin waxes for a variety of other uses including candles, along with high grade lubricating oils are ZEWOPtm products. We produce fertilizers for the agricultural industry, a brick mix for the construction industry, a variety of reclaimed metals, and purified (distilled) water. Acetic acid and furfural are manufactured for industrial chemical manufacturers. We have a diverse mix of products and potential customers. 
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company has a combined CEO/CFO and an SVP Real Estate Development under contract with everyone else required by the company being fulfilled by consultants on a demand basis. Going forward we have pending agreements for a CFO, CPO, COO, CMO, SVP Operations Europe and a SVP Operations Mexico.
 
As the company ramps up the ZEWOPtm in Mexico it anticipates bringing on 50 to 75 employees in this subsidiary. 
 
The Company did not experience any labour disputes or labour stoppages during the current fiscal year.
 
Principal Products
 
The Company’s principal products are carbon black, phenol resins and Levoglucosan making up approximately 70% of our proposed revenue. Waxes account for another 15% while fuels represent 6%.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The raw material for the ZEWOPtm is municipal solid waste (MSW) better known as trash or garbage. Garbage is readily available in every municipality on the planet with only a modest percentage committed to reprocessing, the majority is land-filled or incinerated. Alternatives to MSW include medical waste, agricultural waste, and carbon based industrial waste.
Seasonality of Business
 
Waste from human activities is generated 365 days a year with slight seasonal variations occurring in MSW. Our facilities are designed to run every day of the year. The products we produce are in demand globally and used year round.
 
Industry Practices/Needs for Working Capital
 
The Company is heavily involved in development operations; therefore high levels of working capital will be committed, either directly or indirectly to the construction efforts. After a ZEWOPtm becomes commercially operational, the needs of working capital are expected to be low. The Company is expecting to be significantly involved in development activities for the next 5 to 10 years.
 
Dependence on Few Customers
 
The waste being supplied to each ZEWOPtm comes from millions of residences of a city; however the contract is awarded by one customer typically. Heavy dependency on one customer for the feedstock is mitigated by the form of agreement, long-term and guaranteed provided we stay operational. In the future we may be able to set up direct agreements with homeowners and businesses to purchase there waste materials. 
 
Ultimately, the market for our products is vast; however, the numbers of entities that can physically, logistically and economically purchase the commodity in large quantities in our area of operations are limited. The Company’s primary revenues should originate from carbon black (30 %+) and phenol resin (27 %+) sales. Currently, the Company has interest in these products and others from three multi-national corporations. Mitigation from the risk of only a few customers is their credit-worthiness, a guaranteed long-term contract, with no out, unless we do not perform. The alternative is to setup additional manufacturing of products that use the raw materials we produce so we can sell into the wholesale market with more clients. We can also build up a multitude of small order customers over time. 
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The interest in the waste to energy sector has continued to grow as have the amounts of garbage. Every government on the planet is faced with these growing amounts of garbage and the mandate to use it as a resource rather than bury or burn it. The demand for sustainable energy continues to increase almost everywhere on the planet at the same time. Climate changes affect the demand for heating and cooling and the lack of rain in certain areas impacts on the ability to produce hydro-electricity. Political instability or the threat there of, in oil producing regions sends countries that have petroleum based economies scrambling for alternatives. Economic instability impacts on many countries abilities to import energy causing them to look within their own borders for energy that provides autonomy. Finally the pressure is on all nations to look at and change the environmental impact of their waste. 
 
Each product we produce is made by reprocessing waste making the resulting product “green” and cheaper. Our production process has no emissions or environmental impact compared to competitive products that come from crude oil and natural gas. Because our raw material is garbage we are not subjected to market fluctuations and can consistently maintain our cost of goods compared to our competitors. The finished products are produced at much lower costs than our competitors giving us a natural advantage going forward.
 
Any technology that can produce clean energy from waste in a cost effective manner has a competitive advantage in the complex matrix of sustainable energy production. There have been no emissions free and cost effective energy from waste technologies to handle the ever growing waste. So governments have settled for incineration with scrubbers that remove the pollutants to established levels. The new emission targets being established for waste going forward, limits the competition. TransAct’s Energy from Waste technology at present will be the only technology capable of meeting the future conditions of competition in this arena.
 
Availability of resources, upfront capital and customers willing to pay for the resulting products, determine the generation resource. In markets where they have resources but not expertise or upfront capital the field of competition opens up for those able to build, own, and operate the facility at a profit over the long-term.

The Company believes that the combination of the technologies emissions free status, low operating costs, ability to process all waste streams into useable products with full carbon capture and a low “full life” cost will allow it to successfully compete for long-term waste processing and green product supply agreements globally.
 
Factors that can influence the overall market for our products include some of the following:
 

number of market participants buying and selling green products including fuels; 
 
environmental regulations that impact us and our competitors; 
 
availability of production tax credits and other benefits allowed by tax law; 
 
relative ease or difficulty of developing and constructing new facilities; and 
 
credit worthiness and risk associated with buyers. 
 
Environmental Compliance
 
The TransAct ZEWOPtm already meets the European Union Environmental Protection Agency emission free standards. The plants do not incinerate so there are no flue gases and no ash, all waste delivered to the plant is converted to useable products. 
 
The incoming waste is maintained in-doors under cover, at three-day processing levels, to avoid any possible nuisance. 
 
The storage systems for fuels produced on site pending shipment meet or exceed regional standards for safety and environmental impact.
 
All known environmental issues in ZEWOPtm have been identified and solutions obtained that will mitigate these issues beyond established compliance.

Governmental Regulation 
 
Although we intend to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we are in compliance or that we will be able to comply with all future laws and regulations. Additional national or regional legislation, or changes in regulatory implementation, may limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, or seizures, could be imposed on us. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
The business of industrial plant development and operation is subject to substantial regulation under governmental laws relating to the development, upgrading, marketing, pricing, taxation, and distribution of our products and other matters. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing development and operations of industrial plants could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that income tax laws, royalty regulations and government incentive programs related to our industry generally, will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our progress and cause delays, inability to develop or abandonment of these interests.
 
Permits, leases, licenses, and approvals are required from a variety of regulatory authorities at various stages of development and operation of industrial projects. There can be no assurance that the various government permits, leases, licenses and approvals sought will be granted in respect of our activities or, if granted, will not be cancelled or will be renewed upon expiry. There is no assurance that such permits, leases, licenses, and approvals will not contain terms and provisions which may adversely affect our development and operating activities. 
 
The development and operations of our proposed projects are or will be subject to stringent federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Environmental laws often require parties to pay for remedial action or to pay damages regardless of fault. Environmental laws also often impose liability with respect to divested or terminated operations, even if the operations were terminated or divested many years ago.

The development activities and operating programs on our proposed and future projects are or will be subject to extensive laws and regulations governing, development, production, imports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, plant safety, toxic substances and other matters. Power development and operations are also subject to risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products. Compliance with these laws and regulations will impose substantial costs on us and will subject us to significant potential liabilities. 
 
Our business is subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions. TransAct Energy Corp. in each jurisdiction is subject to regulation in respect of the production, sale and distribution of energy in the form of fuel or electricity. 
 
TransAct will be required to obtain various government approvals for construction of future facilities. 
 
For project development TransAct will hire consulting and engineering services for site development, design, air quality, cooling water reuse, permitting, environmental engineering and regulatory compliance.
 
Environmental Credits
 
As a future “green” product producer, environmental-related credits, such as renewable energy credits or carbon credits,
 may become available for sale to power companies (to allow them to meet their “green” power requirements) or to businesses which produce carbon based pollution. If available, these credits will belong exclusively to us or our joint venture, and may provide an additional source of revenue.
