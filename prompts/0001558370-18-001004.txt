B. | BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
---+---------------------

(1)OCEAN TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT
     Ocean Freight Services:
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following services:
     Ocean Transportation Services:
     Hawaii Service:  Matson’s Hawaii service provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California; Seattle, Washington; and Honolulu, Hawaii.  Matson also operates a network of inter-island barges that provide connecting services from Honolulu, Hawaii to other major ports on the Hawaiian islands of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii.  Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.
     Westbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, building materials, automobiles and household goods.  Matson’s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities and livestock.  The majority of Matson’s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight and automobiles.
     Alaska Service:  Matson’s Alaska service provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off and conventional services) between the port of Tacoma, Washington, and the ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska.  Matson also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska, and other transportation services to smaller locations in Alaska.
     Matson’s northbound cargo to Alaska includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, household goods and automobiles.  Matson’s southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of household goods, automobiles and seafood.
     China Service:  Matson’s expedited China-Long Beach Express (“CLX”) service is part of an integrated service that carries cargo from Long Beach, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, to Guam, and then to Okinawa, Japan.  The vessels continue to the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged primarily in Long Beach, California.  These vessels also carry cargo destined to Hawaii, and originating from the Guam, Micronesia, Japan and China services. Matson provides container transshipment services between the CLX ports and many locations in Asia including, Hong Kong and Xiamen, China.  Westbound cargo consists mainly of recycled materials, while eastbound cargo consists mainly of garments, footwear and other retail merchandise.
     Guam Service:  Matson’s Guam service provides weekly services between the U.S West Coast and Guam, as part of its expedited CLX service.  Matson also provides weekly connecting service from Guam to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  These services carry cargo similar to the Hawaii service described above. 
     Micronesia Service:  Matson’s Micronesia service provides services between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.  Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped

through Guam and consists of mainly general sustenance cargo.  Commencing in 2018, Matson plans to begin a direct service between Honolulu, Hawaii and the Marshall Islands with a U.S. flagged vessel.
     Japan Service:  In September 2017, Matson commenced services to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan, as part of its expedited CLX service.  This service carries mainly general sustenance cargo and household goods supporting the U.S. military.
     South Pacific Service:  Matson’s South Pacific service provides services carrying general sustenance cargo between Auckland, New Zealand and the South Pacific Islands, including Fiji (Suva and Lautoka), Samoa, American Samoa, the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki), Tonga (Nukualofa and Vava’u), and Niue.  Matson also provides transshipment services to the islands of Tahiti, Vanuatu, Nauru and the Solomon Islands (Honiara).  Additionally, Matson also provides slotting arrangements for the transportation of cargo from major ports on the east coast of Australia to ports in the South Pacific Islands.  Matson’s South Pacific service also distributes and sells domestic bulk fuel to a variety of these islands.
     Matson also provides a bi-weekly South Pacific Express (“SPX”) service that connects the U.S. West Coast to the ports in the South Pacific Islands with cargo transshipped from the U.S. West Coast on Matson’s Hawaii and CLX services to a Matson SPX vessel in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The SPX vessel then transports the cargo to the ports in American Samoa and Samoa, with cargo destined for other ports transshipped to Matson’s South Pacific service at the port of Apia, Samoa.  SPX cargo destined for Hawaii or other locations on the U.S. West Coast is shipped to Honolulu, Hawaii, and then transshipped on Matson’ vessels to the U.S. West Coast. 
     Terminal and Other Related Services: 
     Matson provides container stevedoring, refrigerated cargo services, inland transportation, container equipment maintenance and other terminal services (collectively “terminal services”) for MatNav at terminals located on the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai; and in the Alaska terminal locations of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.  Matson also provides terminal services for other ocean carriers at the Alaska terminal locations of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor. 
     Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture SSAT provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at seven terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast and to MatNav at four of those facilities, which are Long Beach and Oakland, California; and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington.  
     Matson utilizes the services of other third-party terminal operators at all of the other ports at which its vessels call. 
     Ship Management Services:  
     Matson contracts with the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide ship management services to manage and maintain three Ready Reserve Force vessels on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration.     Matson’s Vessel and Equipment Information:
     Vessels:
     Matson’s fleet includes both owned and chartered vessels.  Matson’s owned vessels represent an investment of approximately $1.4 billion (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 of Part II below for additional information about vessel costs and net book values).  The majority of Matson’s owned vessels are U.S. flagged vessels, and have been acquired with the assistance of withdrawals from a Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) established under Section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for additional information).  Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels operate in the Hawaii, Guam, Japan, China and Alaska services.  Matson’s non-U.S. flagged vessels operate in the Micronesia and South Pacific services.

 Hawaii Fleet Renewal Program:        Matson has a number of owned steamships that are either actively deployed or used as reserve vessels in its Hawaii service.  All of these steamships are near the end of their useful life.  Beginning January 1, 2020, steamships will no longer comply with established U.S. and international emission regulations without substantial modifications.  In order to renew its Hawaii fleet and prepare for the phase-out of these steamships, Matson is constructing four new vessels to be used in the Hawaii service with the following specifications and expected delivery dates:
    
 | | | | | | | | Usable Cargo Capacity
 | | | | | | Maximum | Maximum | Containers | Vehicles
 | Official | Expected | | Type of | | Speed | Deadweight | | Reefer | 
Name of Vessels | Number | Delivery Date | Class | Vessel | Length | (Knots) | (Long Tons) | TEUs | Slots | Autos

(1) | The two new Aloha Class containerships are being constructed by Philly Shipyard, Inc. (“Philly Shipyard”), with dual-fuel, LNG capable engines.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The two new Kanaloa Class combination container and roll-on/roll-off (“Con-Ro”) vessels are being constructed by General Dynamics NASSCO (“NASSCO”), with dual-fuel, LNG capable engines.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Actual and expected annual contractual construction progress payments based on signed agreements and change orders, excluding owners’ items and capitalized interest are as follows:
    
 | Paid | | Progress Payments Outstanding | | 
Contractual Progress Payments (In millions) | 2017 and Prior | | 2018 | | 2019 | 2020 | | Total
Two Aloha Class Containerships | $ | 253.8 | | $ | 138.0 | $ | 19.1 | | $ | — | $ | 410.9
Two Kanaloa Class Con-Ro Vessels | | 111.2 | | | 251.0 | | 127.8 | | | 23.6 | | 513.6
Total | $ | 365.0 | | $ | 389.0 | $ | 146.9 | | $ | 23.6 | $ | 924.5

      Upon delivery, the four new vessels will replace the steamships currently deployed in Matson’s Hawaii service.  By the end of 2019, Matson expects to have retired all of its steamships as they will no longer comply, subject to substantial modifications, with environmental regulations that are effective as of January 1, 2020.
     When complete, the new Aloha Class containerships and Kanaloa Class Con-Ro vessels are expected to have among the lowest operating cost per TEU of any vessel in the U.S. domestic trades.  The cost efficiencies are expected to be driven by increased vessel utilization and by significantly lower operating costs including fuel consumption, maintenance and repair, and dry-docking costs.  Matson also expects to return to an optimal nine vessel Hawaii fleet deployment.
     Hawaii Terminal Expansion and Modernization Program:
     Matson is in the process of renovating its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii.  In August 2017, Matson signed a contract for the purchase of three new 65 long-ton capacity cranes and modifications to upgrade three existing cranes at its Sand Island Terminal in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The crane investments are part of a broader terminal expansion and modernization program that Matson is undertaking to prepare its Sand Island terminal facility for the arrival of the four new vessels.  Installation of the three new cranes is expected to be complete by the second quarter in 2019.      Equipment:
     As a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson has a variety of equipment including cranes, containers, and chassis which represents an investment of approximately $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.  Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements.

(2) | Specialty equipment includes auto frames, flat racks, insulated containers, open top containers, platforms, flat bed trailers and tanks.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Operating Costs:
     Major components of Ocean Transportation operating costs are as follows:
     Direct Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs, purchased outside transportation and other related costs.  
     Vessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs; fuel consumption, pilot, tugs and line related costs; vessel charter expenses and other vessel related expenses.  Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations; and also pays fuel surcharges to other third party transportation providers.
     Operating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment operating lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead.
     Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards established by U.S. Coast Guard rules and classification society requirements.  These standards require that our vessels undergo two dry-docking inspections within a five-year period.  The majority of Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels used in the Hawaii service are enrolled in the U.S. Coast Guard’s Underwater Survey in Lieu of Dry-docking (“UWILD”) program.  The UWILD program allows eligible vessels to meet their intermediate dry-docking requirement with a less costly underwater inspection.
     Matson is responsible for ensuring that its non-U.S flagged owned and bareboat chartered vessels meet international standards for seaworthiness, which among other requirements generally mandate that Matson perform two dry-docking inspections every five years.  The dry-dockings of Matson’s time chartered vessels are the responsibility of the vessel owners.
     Competition:
     The following is a summary of major competitors in Matson’s Ocean Transportation service:
     Hawaii Service: Matson’s Hawaii service has one major U.S. flag Jones Act ocean carrier competitor, Pasha Hawaii (“Pasha”), which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California to Hawaii.  There also are two U.S. flag Jones Act barge operators, Aloha Marine Lines and Sause Brothers, which offer barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.
     Foreign-flag vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii.  Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo.  Air freight competition for time-sensitive and perishable cargo exists; however, inroads by such competition in terms of cargo volume are limited by the amount of cargo space available in passenger aircrafts and by the cost of air freight transportation.
     Matson vessels are operated on schedules that provide customers, shippers and consignees fixed day-of-the-week sailings from the U.S. West Coast as well as fixed day-of-the-week arrivals in Hawaii.  Matson offers four westbound sailings per week, though this amount may be adjusted according to seasonal demand and market conditions.  One of Matson’s westbound sailings each week continues on to Guam, Japan and China, so the number of eastbound sailings direct from Hawaii to the U.S. Mainland is three per week.  This service is attractive to customers because more frequent sailings permit customers to reduce inventory carrying costs.  Matson also competes by offering a more comprehensive

service to customers, including: service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast provided by Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture partner SSAT; a dedicated inter-island barge network; an award winning customer service team; and its efficiency and experience in handling cargo of all types.
     Alaska Service:  Matson’s Alaska service has one major U.S. flag Jones Act competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska.  There are also two U.S flag Jones Act barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines which mainly provides services from Seattle, Washington to the main ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug & Barge which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations.  The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers. Foreign-flag vessels provide alternatives for companies shipping cargo (mainly seafood) from the Alaska ports of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.
     Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled services from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska and weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a weekly barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood. Matson offers dedicated terminal services at the Alaska ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor performed by MatNav, and at the port of Tacoma, Washington performed by Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture partner SSAT.
     China Service: Major competitors to Matson’s China service include large international carriers such as Maersk, MSC, APL, CMA CGM, Evergreen, China COSCO, “K” Line, OOCL, Hyundai, SM Line and NYK Line.
     Matson competes by offering a fast and reliable service from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China to Long Beach, California, providing fixed day arrivals and next-day cargo availability.  Matson’s service is further differentiated by offering a dedicated marine terminal in Long Beach, California provided by Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture partner SSAT, an off-dock container yard providing fast truck turn times, one-stop intermodal connections, and providing state-of-the-art technology and world-class customer service.  Matson has offices in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai.
     Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service has one major competitor, APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged container feeder service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea.  Waterman operates a roll-on/roll-off service which periodically calls at Guam.  There are also several foreign carriers that call at Guam from foreign origin ports.
     Japan Service:  Matson’s Japan service competes primarily with APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the Port of Naha, Okinawa, Japan.
     Micronesia and the South Pacific Services: Matson’s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.
     Customer Concentration:  
     Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 23 percent, 24 percent and 23 percent of the Company’s Ocean Transportation revenue, respectively.  None of these customers accounted for more than 10 percent of Matson’s Ocean Transportation operating revenues.  For additional information on Ocean Transportation revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.     Seasonality:
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation services typically experience seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters.  This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade.  As a result, earnings tend to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings

variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons while freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.
     Maritime Laws and the Jones Act:
     Maritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).
     The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy.  Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens.  U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members.  Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited.
     During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 72 percent and 71 percent of Matson’s ocean transportation revenues, respectively, came from the Hawaii and Alaska trades that were subject to the Jones Act.  Matson’s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market.  Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska due to its geographical location, are both dependent on ocean transportation.  The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations.  Matson’s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified.
     Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (“AMP”), which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws.  The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress.  Matson also believes that the ongoing war on terrorism has further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support.  AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws.  Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flag vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations.
     Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built.
     Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 50 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services.  Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions.
     Rate Regulations and Fuel Related Surcharge:        Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates.  A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index.  Matson generally provides a 30-day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and terminal handling charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible.
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S. foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”).  The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of ocean-borne international transportation of the U.S.  Conducting business in foreign shipping markets subjects the Company to certain risks (see Item 1A of Part I below for additional information about such risks).
     Matson applies a fuel surcharge rate to its ocean transportation customers.  Changes in the fuel surcharge levels are correlated to prevailing market rates for bunker fuel prices along with other fuel related cost factors.

     Emission Regulations:  
     Matson is focused on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and truck efficiency; and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions.
     The global sulfur emissions cap was reduced to 3.5 percent effective January 1, 2012, and is scheduled to be further reduced to 0.5 percent beginning January 1, 2020. With respect to North America, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) received approval from the International Maritime Organization, in coordination with Environment Canada, to designate all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coast lines as designated emission control areas (“ECAs”).  Most of Matson’s vessels operate a portion of their voyages in ECAs while Matson’s Alaska vessels operate a substantial portion of their voyages in ECAs.  The North American ECA went into effect on August 1, 2012, limiting the sulfur emissions to 1.0 percent, with scheduled reductions in future years.  Beginning January 1, 2015, maximum sulfur emissions permitted in designated ECA’s were reduced to 0.1 percent.
     In December 2017, Matson received an ECA Permit that is effective through December 31, 2019, for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Hawaii service.  Beginning January 1, 2018, the ECA Permit allows for the use of fuel with 0.9 percent or less of sulfur content, with subsequent target reductions in fuel sulfur content to occur in increments of not less that  0.05 percent on a semiannual basis.  The ECA Permit is subject to the development of technologies that monitor main engine performance and promote full power operations on fuels with a sulfur content of less than 0.1 percent.  The Company continues to develop solutions and other operating strategies to comply with the requirements of the ECA Permit for these three vessels.

 Competition:
     Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services.  The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. 
     Matson Logistics’ transportation brokerage services competes most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, the Hub Group, and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as J.B. Hunt.  Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; and real-time visibility into the movement of customers’ goods and other technology solutions.  Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo.
     Matson Logistics’ freight forwarding services compete most directly with a variety of freight forwarding companies that operate within Alaska including Carlile, Lynden, American Fast Freight and Alaska Traffic Company.
     Customer Concentration:
     Matson Logistics serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s 10 largest logistics customers accounted for approximately 19 percent, 22 percent and 23 percent of Matson’s Logistics revenue, respectively.  None of these customers accounted for more than 10 percent of Matson Logistics’ operating revenues.  For additional information on Logistics revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.     Seasonality:
     Matson’s Logistics services are generally not significantly impacted by seasonality factors, except for its freight forwarding service to Alaska which is affected by the winter weather, the cyclical nature of the oil, construction and fishing industries, and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry.
C. | EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
---+------------------------------

      Employees:
     As of December 31, 2017, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,947 employees, of which 748 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with shoreside and offshore unions.  These numbers do not include billets on vessels discussed below, employees of SSAT, or other non-employees, such as agents, temporary workers and contractors.
     Matson’s active fleet employed seagoing personnel in 328 billets at December 31, 2017.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  Matson’s ship management services also employed personnel in 28 billets at December 31, 2017.
     Bargaining Agreements:
     Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (“PMA”), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (“ILWU”) on the U.S. Pacific Coast.  The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor.  In August 2017, the ILWU agreed to extend its contract with the PMA to July 1, 2022.  Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with other unions that expire at various dates in the future.
     Matson’s seagoing employees are represented by unions for both unlicensed and licensed crew members.  
 Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future.
     Certain collective bargaining agreements expire during 2018.  While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements with its various unions as they expire without any significant impact on its
