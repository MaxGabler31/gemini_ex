Overview
 We are a fully-integrated, clinical stage precision oncology biopharmaceutical company developing targeted therapies to redefine treatment for biomarker-specific patient populations. Driven by a commitment to rigorous science and a passion for improving the lives of people impacted by cancer and other life-threatening diseases, we are advancing a robust pipeline of investigational, small molecule oncology compounds with a biomarker-driven approach that targets genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells to deliver new therapies for patients suffering from aggressive hematologic and solid tumor cancers for which there are currently limited treatment options. While we are primarily focused on oncology, we are opportunistically developing therapeutics outside of oncology where we can leverage our existing expertise in immune cell metabolism to treat diseases with unmet needs, as is the case in cystic fibrosis.
Targeted, Biomarker-Defined Small Molecules
 In October 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Millennium, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to acquire two clinical-stage compounds, both of which have demonstrated single-agent clinical activity in biomarker-defined cancer patient populations. The compounds are the TORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib (CB-228, formerly TAK-228) and the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor mivavotinib (CB-659, formerly TAK-659), both of which significantly strengthen our precision oncology pipeline. This was a transformative transaction that aligns with Calithera’s focus and deep expertise in targeted, small-molecule cancer therapies. Our near-term clinical development plans leverage our expertise in conducting biomarker focused clinical trials by developing sapanisertib in NRF2 (also known as NFE2L2)-mutated squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and mivavotinib in activated B-cell (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with and without MYD88/CD79b mutations. By focusing on well-characterized genetic vulnerabilities with molecules that have already shown single-agent activity, we will be able to generate phase 2 data with targeted, efficient study designs. We intend to announce data from these studies by the first quarter of 2023.
Mivavotinib
 Mivavotinib is a SYK inhibitor that targets the constitutively activated B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway in DLBCL and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). In completed Phase 1/2 clinical trials mivavotinib showed promising single-agent responses with deep and durable activity in unselected patients with DLBCL and other NHLs that had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range of prior lines 1-11). Mivavotinib demonstrated higher clinical response rates than other SYK inhibitors evaluated in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. The overall safety profile of mivavotinib appears favorable for further development as a single agent and in combination with standard of care therapies.
 SYK is known to activate multiple cell-signaling pathways in activated B-cell like (ABC) DLBCL: NF-kB and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, compared to germinal center B-cell like (GCB) DLBCL, where it primarily activates the PI3K pathway. We conducted a retrospective analysis of completed clinical trials of mivavotinib monotherapy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL, looking at overall response rate (ORR) by DLBCL cell of origin in patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Mivavotinib showed a substantially higher response rate in ABC (53%) compared to GCB (22%) DLBCL. In addition, recent preclinical studies have shown enhanced SYK activity and sensitivity to SYK inhibition in DLBCL and other NHLs harboring mutations in MyD88 and/or CD79, which comprise a distinct genetic subset of ABC DLBCL known to have poor outcomes with standard of care therapy. The compelling single agent ORR in ABC DLBCL, and potential for further enrichment of single agent activity in a genetically-defined subset of ABC DLBCL with MyD88/CD79 mutations provide a well-defined, efficient development path to a potential single agent accelerated approval in these populations.
We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study of mivavotinib in the first half of 2022 for the treatment of patients with non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL with and without mutations in MyD88 and CD79. Data generated from this study could position the company to initiate a study with registrational intent in biomarker-specific populations in DLBCL. We intend to announce data from this study by the first quarter of 2023.
DLBCL represents the most common subtype of NHL and represents approximately 30% of all NHL cases. Twenty-four thousand people are diagnosed in the US each year with an approximately 60% 5-year survival rate. MyD88 mutations occur in approximately 30%, and CD79 mutations occur in 10-15%, of all DLBCL cases. Approximately 50% of all ABC DLBCL tumors have one or both of these mutations.


Beyond DLBCL, both preclinical and clinical data support expansion across additional NHL subtypes and other hematologic malignancies as part of long-term plans. Additional development plans may include generating data in Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM) and other NHLs with MyD88/CD79 mutations, and exploring combinations with standard of care agents such as ibrutinib, venetoclax, and anti-CD20 in various subtypes of NHL.
Sapanisertib
 Sapanisertib is a dual target of rapamycin kinase C I/II (TORC1/2) inhibitor that targets a key survival mechanism in KEAP1/NRF2-mutated tumor cells. These mutations are found in a considerable subpopulation of patients across multiple solid tumor types. In squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC), NRF2 mutations occur in approximately 15% of patients, and KEAP1 mutations occur in approximately 12% of patients. Sapanisertib has demonstrated promising single-agent activity in patients with R/R NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC and exhibits differential antitumor activity compared to rapalog inhibitors of TORC1 in NRF2-mutant sqNSCLC xenograft models. Sapanisertib has a well-characterized clinical safety profile and was well tolerated in R/R non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
Of the greater than 235,000 people diagnosed with NSCLC in the US each year, approximately 25-30% of those are sqNSCLC. Actionable mutations are only found in 1-5% of sqNSCLC patients, leaving few options after PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy. The standard of care chemotherapy options in R/R sqNSCLC have a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3-4.5 months. Because NRF2/KEAP1 mutations confer a poorer prognosis for NSCLC patients, sapanisertib has the potential to address a substantial underserved patient population.
A Phase 2 study planned to begin in the first half of 2022 will strengthen the existing data on sapanisertib as a monotherapy in patients with squamous NSCLC harboring a NRF2 mutation and also evaluate its activity NRF2 WT sqNSCLC. Data generated from this study could position the company to initiate a registrational study in sqNSCLC. We intend to announce data from this study by the first quarter of 2023. Additional development plans may include exploring the potential of sapanisertib in KEAP1 mutant tumors in NSCLC and KEAP1/NRF2 mutant tumor types beyond NSCLC.
 Pursuant to the APA, in October 2021, we paid Millennium an upfront payment of $10.0 million in cash and issued to Millennium 1,000,000 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock that is initially convertible at the option of the holder into approximately 17.2 shares of common stock based on the $2.04 per share closing stock price of our common stock on October 15, 2021. We will make tiered earn-out payments of high single-digits to low teens on net sales of CB-228 products and CB-659 products, subject to certain customary reductions. Millennium will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $470.0 million in clinical development, regulatory and sales milestone payments across both programs.
Synthetic Lethality Preclinical Pipeline
 In June 2021, we became a member of the Broad Institute’s Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) Consortium. The goal of the DepMap initiative at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is to discover new targets and biomarkers for precision cancer medicines. Membership in the Consortium is an opportunity for us to generate novel data for discovery programs and forge deeper collaborations with Broad Institute’s data and computational scientists in order to enable translational decisions for our programs. We plan to utilize this partnership with the Broad Institute to continue to explore biomarkers for our clinical programs, as well as identify biomarker-defined subpopulations of cancer patients for undisclosed pipeline programs.
VPS4A Inhibitors
 In addition, Calithera continues to leverage its discovery engine to build a preclinical pipeline of synthetic lethality targets with a focus on paralog genes. We will present data describing novel VPS4A inhibitors discovered by Calithera at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2022 Annual Meeting. The accepted poster will detail Calithera’s discovery of a novel series of VPS4A inhibitors that are currently advancing through lead optimization. VPS4A and VPS4B are paralog ATPases essential for remodeling intracellular organelle membranes. Loss of function of both paralogs is lethal. Both homozygous and heterozygous loss of VPS4B in cancer cells makes them vulnerable to VPS4A inhibition. VPS4B is lost in a heterozygous fashion in the majority of colorectal carcinomas (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ovarian, esophageal and head and neck cancers and is deleted in large numbers of other tumor types. The preclinical data demonstrate that VPS4A inhibition in cell lines with loss of VPS4B preferentially showed profound cell kill response.
Additional Small Molecule Programs
 Arginase Inhibitor CB-280 for Cystic Fibrosis
 Our product candidate, CB-280, which is solely owned by Calithera, is a novel oral inhibitor of arginase being developed for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF. In October 2020, we were awarded up to $2.4 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to support development of CB-280. Arginase is secreted by infiltrating neutrophils in the lungs of CF patients and depletes the amino acid arginine. Arginine is critical for the generation of sufficient nitric oxide, or NO, to maintain anti-microbial effects and bronchodilation in the lungs of CF patients. We completed a Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of oral CB-280 in healthy volunteers. In July 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients with CF who are on a stable regimen of CF therapies and have chronic airway infection. The randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial is evaluating multiple ascending doses of CB-280, dosed orally twice daily (BID) for 14 days, compared to placebo in up to 32 adult CF patients to determine a safe dose range for CB-280. In November 2021, we presented interim data from the Phase 1b trial at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) on the first 24 subjects (18 treated with CB-280, 6 with placebo) participating in the trial. Data were presented for 50mg BID, 100mg BID and 200mg BID dose levels and showed that CB-280 was well tolerated across dose levels, and all 18 patients receiving CB-280 completed treatment without treatment interruptions or premature discontinuations. CB-280 demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics (PK), as well as complete and continuous target inhibition in plasma at doses at or above 100mg. CB-280 also demonstrated robust pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, with rapid and significant dose-proportional increases in plasma arginine, the key driver of NO production. Enrollment of cohort 4 (300mg BID) and analysis is complete. No new safety signals were seen and plasma arginine, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and FEV1 showed trends consistent with previous cohorts. Evaluation of next steps is ongoing. We plan on publishing the Ph1b data in the future.
IL4I1 Inhibitor CB-668
 We have also discovered CB-668, a first-in-class, potent, orally administered inhibitor of the immune-suppressive enzyme IL4I1. IL4I1 is an enzyme that is expressed by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells that metabolizes phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan to produce hydrogen peroxide, an inhibitor of T-cell function. In particular, IL4I1 can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenic acid and other metabolites that lead to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical data were presented at the 2020 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. In syngeneic mouse models CB-668 exhibited immune mediated, single agent activity and augmented activity in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. IL4I1 expression has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes and expression is elevated in multiple tumor types including ovarian and B-cell tumors.
Glutaminase Inhibitor Telaglenastat (CB-839)
 In November 2021, we announced the discontinuation of the phase 2 telaglenastat KEAPSAKE clinical trial in patients with non-squamous NSCLC with genetic mutations in KEAP1/NRF2 based on a lack of clinical benefit observed in patients treated with telaglenastat in an interim analysis. The phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind KEAPSAKE study was designed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of telaglenastat plus standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy as front-line therapy among patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC whose tumors have a KEAP1 or NRF2 mutation. At the time of unblinding on October 27, 2021, there were 40 patients randomized. The available efficacy data at unblinding, including investigator-assessed PFS, did not demonstrate clinical benefit, and analysis of the data led to the conclusion that there was a very low probability for the study to achieve a positive result. No difference in safety profile was seen between the two arms. Calithera has no plans to continue the development of telaglenastat at this time.
Partnered Programs
 Arginase Inhibitor INCB001158 for Oncology
 An additional arginase inhibitor, INCB001158, was discovered by Calithera and is being developed by Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, for oncology and hematology indications, and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1/2 trials in combination with other anti-cancer agents. In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, with Incyte. Under the terms of the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, we granted Incyte an exclusive, worldwide license to co-develop and co-commercialize our small molecule arginase inhibitors for hematology and oncology indications. In September 2021, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with Incyte. Concurrently, the parties also filed a dismissal of the complaint we filed against Incyte for breach of contract in the Superior Court of California. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Release, which resolves all claims in the complaint without any admission of liability or fault, Incyte agreed to pay us a negotiated settlement amount of $6.75 million and the parties exchanged mutual releases. In September 2021, we received and recognized the $6.75 million as milestone revenues. Effective September 30, 2020, we opted out of our co-development obligations as permitted under the terms of the Incyte Collaboration Agreement. As a result of our decision to opt out, Incyte will pay all costs to develop INCB001158 or any other licensed products. Incyte will pay us tiered royalties ranging from the low double digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products and total remaining potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestones of $720.0 million.
CD73 Inhibitor CB-708 (ATG037) for Oncology
 Another area of research interest has been immune-modulatory enzymes. We have developed CB-708, a highly potent, selective, orally-bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73. Preclinical data were presented at the 2019 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting and the 2019 SITC meeting demonstrating that CB-708 has immune-mediated, single agent activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models. In pre-clinical studies CB-708 was well tolerated and shows enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with either an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy or with chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin or doxorubicin. In May 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Antengene Investment Limited, or Antengene, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Antengene Corporation, where we granted Antengene an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize CB-708 (now ATG-037). Under the terms of the license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $3.0 million in May 2021 and may receive potential development, regulatory and sales milestone of up to $252.0 million. Additionally, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of licensed product up to low double-digits. In February 2022, Antengene announced the approval of ATG-037 by the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) in Australia to initiate the Phase I STAMINA trial, a first-in-human study of ATG-037 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to advance investigational, small molecule oncology compounds with a biomarker-driven approach that targets genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells to deliver new therapies for patients suffering from aggressive hematologic and solid tumor cancers for which there are currently limited treatment option. Biomarker-driven approaches are mitigating some of the clinical development risks inherent in drug development. They are also evolving cancer care for both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors by accelerating delivery of new therapies that provide clinical benefit to patients, with potentially fewer side effects. These are our key strategic initiatives:
 •Develop mivavotinib, an orally dosed, potent and selective SYK inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with Activated B-Cell (ABC) cell-of origin and/or MyD8 or CD79 mutations. Mivavotinib has durable single agent responses in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, with a differentiated profile from other SYK inhibitors. SYK controls key activation pathways in ABC DLBCL, activating both NF-kB and PI3K pathways, driving proliferation and survival. Pathway biology predicts SYK inhibitors to be active, with higher activity in ABC and retrospective analysis of ORR by cell of origin showed enriched clinical activity of mivavotinib in ABC patients. Preclinical data has shown that MyD88 and CD79b mutations also hyperactivate SYK, and roughly 50% of ABC DLBCL tumors have one or both of these mutations. Calithera plans to initiate a phase 2 study to begin in the first half of 2022 for the treatment of patient with ABC DLBCL with and without mutations in MyD88 and CD79. Data from this study could position the company to initiate a registrational study. We intend to announce data from this study by the first quarter of 2023. Additional development plans may include evaluating mivavotinib in combination with standard of care DLBCL drugs, exploring biomarkers for GCB DLBCL, and expansion into Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia, other NHL, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
    •Develop sapanisertib, a potent and selective oral inhibitor of mTOR1/2, for the treatment of patients with NRF2-mutated squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC). Sapanisertib showed durable single agent activity in a phase 2 trial of relapsed/refractory sqNSCLC whose tumors harbor NRF2 (NFE2L2) mutations, a genetically defined group of patients with poorer prognosis than WT. Sapanisertib is a differentiated molecule from other mTOR inhibitors and is the only inhibitor to have strong single agent activity in NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC xenografts. NRF2- or KEAP1-mutant tumors constitutively activate the oxidative stress pathway to support survival, and NRF2 activation upregulates mTOR activity. Sapanisertib inhibits mTORC1/2, blocking proliferation and inducing cell death. In phase 2 studies of sapanisertib in patients with solid tumors, sapanisertib was well-tolerated. SqNSCLC makes up 25%-30% of all NSCLC, and roughly 15% of these have NRF2 mutations. A Phase 2 study planned to begin in the first half of 2022 will strengthen the existing data on sapanisertib as a monotherapy in patients with squamous NSCLC harboring a NRF2 mutation and further evaluate its activity in WT squamous NSCLC. Data from this study could position the company to initiate a registrational study. We intend to announce data from this study by the first quarter of 2023. Additional development plans may include exploring the potential of sapanisertib in KEAP1 mutant tumors in NSCLC and KEAP/NRF2 mutant tumor types beyond NSCLC.
    •Advance VPS4 synthetic lethality target and continue to leverage our discovery engine to build robust preclinical pipeline of synthetic lethality targets with a focus on paralog genes. VPS4 is our most advanced synthetic lethality program. VPS4A and B are paralog ATPases essential for remodelling intracellular organelle membranes, loss of function of both paralogs is lethal. Heterozygous or homozygous loss of VPS4B in cancer cells makes them vulnerable to inhibition of VPS4A. Homozygous deletion of VPS4B occurs in 1-3% of several solid tumor types, and heterozygous deletion is common across solid tumor cancers, notably ~65% in CRC and PDAC. Calithera has identified small molecule 


inhibitors of VPS4 and is pursuing lead optimization with the goal of identifying a clinical candidate and initiating clinical trials.
Our Research and Development Programs
 The following table summarizes our wholly-owned and partnered programs. We also intend to develop additional product candidates from our research and discovery efforts in these fields.
The Evolution of Cancer Therapeutic Agents
 Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of aberrant cells in the body, leading to the invasion of essential organs and often death. Unlike normal cells, which grow only in response to carefully regulated signals from the body, cancer cells are able to proliferate largely without external signals. Cancer cells have gained this ability as the result of genetic alterations that change protein expression or function. Invasive tumors, also known as metastatic tumors, which are the greatest threat to patients, typically have multiple mutations, deletions or amplifications of genes encoding key proteins that regulate cell growth. These alterations allow the cancer cell to grow, invade other tissues, and avoid recognition and destruction by the body’s immune system.
 Initially, the pharmacological treatment of cancer utilized non-specific cytotoxic agents that targeted all rapidly dividing cells, including normal cells. These non-specific cytotoxic agents have anti-tumor effects but their use is often limited by severe toxicities. As the understanding of the proteins and pathways that enable cancer cells to thrive has evolved, newer more targeted agents have been developed that block specific proteins that are activated in cancer cells.
 As cancer cells evolve, they acquire genetic vulnerabilities that normal cells do not have. These vulnerabilities create a unique pathway for precisely targeting treatments. These genetic vulnerabilities are readily measurable and can often act as biomarkers, allowing the identification of patients who may derive the most benefit from targeted therapies. Biomarker-driven approaches are mitigating some of the clinical development risks inherent in drug development. They are also evolving cancer care for both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors by accelerating delivery of new therapies that provide clinical benefit to patients, with potentially fewer side effects.
 Calithera is advancing a robust pipeline of investigational, small molecule oncology compounds with a biomarker-driven approach that targets genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells to deliver new therapies for patients suffering from aggressive hematologic and solid tumor cancers for which there are currently limited treatment options.


Our Programs
 Targeted, Biomarker-Defined Small Molecules
 SYK Inhibitor Mivavotinib (CB-659)
 DLBCL is the most common form of lymphoma, representing ~30% of all NHL diagnoses. Approximately 24,000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL in the US each year, with a ~60% 5-year survival rate. DLBCL treatments are the same for all patients, despite the fact that it is a biologically heterogeneous disease with different cell-of-origin: ~40% GCB, ~50% ABC and ~10% unclassified. DLBCL cell-of-origin is routinely collected at the time of initial diagnosis, using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay called the Hans algorithm, which classifies tumors as GCB or non-GCB. Currently, R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is the standard of care for newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. While a fraction of patients will go into remission following R-CHOP, a fraction of patients also relapse or are refractory to R-CHOP. For those patients, the options are salvage chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and more recent entrants to the treatment landscape such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T), antibody drug conjugates like polatuzumab and loncastuximab, and other drugs like tafasitamab and Selinexor. However, high unmet need remains for patients who are ineligible for, or relapse after, CAR-T or transplant. Currently, there are no defined patient strategies to optimize therapy for patients in the relapsed or refractory setting. Patients with ABC DLBCL have a poorer prognosis than others; they have fewer curative responses to R-CHOP and shorter median overall survival (OS). Currently there are no approved treatments specifically for non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL patients.
 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that chronic activation of the BCR signaling pathway is a key driver of ABC DLBLC survival. SYK controls key activation pathways in ABC DLBCL, activating NF-kB and PI3K pathways, driving proliferation and survival. In contrast, in GCB DLBCL SYK activates the PI3K pathway. Pathway biology predicts SYK inhibitors to be active in both ABC and GCB, with higher activity in ABC as it controls multiple activation pathways in ABC DLBCL.
 Mivavotinib is an orally dosed, potent and selective SYK kinase inhibitor that targets the constitutively activated BCR pathway in DLBCL and other NHLs. In completed Phase 1/2 clinical NHL trials, mivavotinib showed promising single-agent responses with deep and durable activity in unselected patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other NHLs that had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range of prior lines 1-11). In a pooled analysis of two completed trials (Takeda C34001 and C34004) of mivavotinib monotherapy in unselected R/R DLBCL patients, mivavotinib showed an ORR of 33% with a CR rate of 16% in 81 response evaluable patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 100mg once daily. Responses were durable over several months, with median duration of response (DOR) not reached.
Based on the increased reliance on SYK and BCR pathway signaling in ABC DLBCL, we conducted a retrospective analysis of ORR by cell of origin using Hans algorithm in the completed Takeda studies. In response evaluable patients with available cell-of-origin data who were treated at the RP2D with, ORR was 53% (8/15) in non-GCB (ABC) compared to 22% (10/45) in GCB patients, consistent with predictions based on pathway biology. Patients with unknown cell-of-origin were excluded from this analysis. In addition, recent preclinical studies have shown enhanced SYK activity and sensitivity to SYK inhibition in DLBCL and other NHLs harboring mutations in MyD88 and/or CD79, which comprise a distinct genetic subset of ABC DLBCL known to have poor outcomes with standard-of-care therapy. Specifically, SYK phosphorylation and activation were seen to be the highest in ABC DLBCL cell lines harboring MYD88 and CD79 mutations, and SYK was seen to drive signaling through both the BCR pathway and the toll-like receptor (TLR)/MYD88 pathway in the setting of activating mutations in MYD88 and CD79. We estimate that ~50% of non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL tumors harbor a MyD88 and/or CD79b mutation. The hyperactivation of SYK in the context of MYD88 and/or CD79 mutations suggests potential for further enrichment of single agent activity in this genetically-defined subset of non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL, exceeding the 53% ORR seen in non-GCB (ABC) patients. In a retrospective analysis of NHL patients, 2 out of 3 patients with available CD79b mutational data had complete responses (CR), 1 with DLBCL and 1 with follicular lymphoma (FL). Furthermore, while Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors block BCR pathway signaling and are active in CD79b-mutated DLBCL, they are not active in MyD88-mutated tumors that are CD79 wild-type, which constitute 70% of all MYD88 mutated DLBCL. The compelling single agent ORR in non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL, and potential for further enrichment in MyD88/CD79-mutated non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL, provides a well-defined, efficient development path to a potential single agent accelerated approval in these biomarker-defined populations of DLBCL. Additionally, an oral drug with enriched efficacy in a subset of DLBCL with high unmet need would address an important therapeutic gap in the current treatment landscape.
 The safety profile of mivavotinib is favorable for development as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. Over 300 patients with hematologic malignancies have been treated with mivavotinib with a favorable safety profile. The most common adverse events were asymptomatic and reversible laboratory abnormalities. Mivavotinib is also combinable with bendamustine-rituximab, ibrutinib, and R-CHOP, as demonstrated by prior studies. 
Clinical data show mivavotinib is differentiated from other SYK inhibitors, as it showed substantially higher single agent response rates than other SYK inhibitors, which had monotherapy response rates of less than 10 percent in similar DLBLC patient

populations. In separate preclinical experiments, mivavotinib showed high tissue distribution, a large volume of distribution, and high tumor:plasma exposure ratio. Therefore, the greater clinical activity seen with mivavotinib than in other SYK inhibitors could be due to higher tissue penetration and duration of target engagement.
 Based on the combined clinical and preclinical data, we designed a two-part phase 2 trial of mivavotinib in relapsed or refractory non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL with enrichment of MYD88/CD79b mutated tumors using liquid NGS testing. The phase 2a portion of the study will confirm activity in the biomarker-defined subsets and further refine dose/schedule. The trial will enroll non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL patients based on Hans algorithm, and MyD88 and CD79 mutation status will be collected using ctDNA based liquid NGS to accrue a pre-specified number of patients harboring MyD88 or CD79b mutations. Patients will be randomized to either a standard dosing schedule (100mg QD) or an induction dosing schedule (120mg QD x 14 days, followed by 80mg QD). First patient in (FPI) is anticipated to be in the first half of 2022. Data from this study could position the company to initiate a registrational study. We intend to announce data from this study by the first quarter of 2023. Phase 2b could be registration-enabling and would potentially enroll expansion cohorts comprised of non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL and MyD88 and/or CD79m DLBCL, with a primary endpoint of ORR to target accelerated approval as a single agent in these biomarker-defined subsets.
 While the single agent biomarker-defined phase 2 may provide an initial indication in R/R non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL, we plan to rapidly pursue combination strategies with novel and/or standard-of-care therapies to expand development in earlier lines of therapy in DLBCL. Additional paths for monotherapy and combination development include Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia (which has a 95% prevalence of MYD88 mutation), a biomarker-defined subset of GCB DLBCL, and other indolent lymphomas where mivavotinib has shown compelling single agent responses in completed trials. Lastly, based on its dual SYK and FLT3 inhibition profile, and encouraging single agent response rate in relapsed/refractory AML, we are also interested in exploring its activity in biomarker-defined subsets of AML where SYK inhibition has been shown to be particularly effective.
 mTORC1/2 Inhibitor Sapanisertib
 A total of 50,000-60,000 sqNSCLC patients are diagnosed in the US each year, comprising 25-30% of all NSCLC. Only 1-5% of tumors have actionable mutations, such as EGFR, KRAS, etc. The 5-year metastatic survival rate among sqNSCLC patients is 7%. Standard-of-care for 1L therapy consists of an anti-PD-1 agent and chemotherapy. For 2L therapy, standard of care is salvage chemotherapy, which is associated with a median PFS of 3 to 4.5 months. NRF2 mutations occur in approximately 15% of patients, and KEAP mutations occur in approximately 12% of patients. Patients with tumors harboring the NRF2 or KEAP1 mutation are known to have significantly poorer outcomes compared to wild-type NRF2/KEAP1 tumors. Therefore, NRF2 mutated sqNSCLC represents an especially high unmet need subpopulation of lung cancer for which there are currently no effective therapies.
Sapanisertib is a potent and selective, dual TORC1/2 inhibitor that targets a key survival mechanism in NRF2/KEAP1-mutated tumor cells. By targeting such tumor types, sapanisertib has the potential to address a substantial underserved patient population. Activating mutations in NRF2 or inactivating mutations in KEAP1 lead to constitutive activation of the oxidative stress pathway, enhancing tumor growth and survival. NRF2 activation has been shown to upregulate the mTOR pathway.
In preclinical studies evaluating the anti-tumor activity of sapanisertib across a panel of NSCLC cell lines, the most potent antitumor activity was seen in NRF2 mutant sqNSCLC, while it was not active in NRF2 wild-type cell lines. Additionally, it showed moderate activity in KEAP1 mutant cell lines and was inactive in KEAP1 WT cells. In a NRF2 mutated mouse xenograft model, sapanisertib was the only inhibitor to have strong single agent efficacy, while TORC1 inhibitors everolimus and deferolimus were inactive, supporting the need for dual TORC1/2 inhibition in NRF2 mutated sqNSCLC.
 In a recent Phase 2 trial, sapanisertib demonstrated durable single agent activity (27% [3/11] ORR) in a subset of heavily pretreated NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC patients. Responses in NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC patients were durable, with a median PFS of 8.9 months (95% CI: 7 mo, not reached). In comparison, ORR was 17% [1/6] in KEAP1-mutated sqNSCLC and 0% [0/5] in patients with KEAP1-mutated/KRAS-mutated adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC.
 Sapanisertib has a well established and manageable safety profile. In 3 separate trials in patients with NSCLC and other R/R solid tumors, sapanisertib (3-5mg QD) was well tolerated, with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) being predominantly Grade 1/2. The most commonly observed TEAE was hyperglycemia, which was well controlled with oral hypoglycemic therapy and home glucose monitoring. Out of 93 patients treated across these 5 studies, only one patient discontinued for hyperglycemia at evaluated QD doses. The most common Grade ³3 TEAE was hyperglycemia (25%; 23/93), followed by rash macular and fatigue (8% each), and hypophosphatemia, abdominal pain, and hyponatremia (4% each).


We are initiating a two-part Phase 2 study of sapanisertib monotherapy in NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC patients, comprised of a population-defining part (phase 2a) and a potentially registration-enabling part (phase 2b). The phase 2a part of the study will evaluate sapanisertib 2 mg BID or 3 mg QD in patients with sqNSCLC harboring either WT or mutated NRF2, as detected by NGS. The objectives of phase 2a are dose refinement and confirmation of the selective activity in NRF2-mutated tumors compared to WT tumors to validate NRF2 mutation as the selection biomarker. Enrollment is expected to begin in the first half of 2022. Data generated from this study could position the company to initiate a registrational study in NRF2-mutated squamous NSCLC. The phase 2b part of the study is planned to be a single-arm expansion study evaluating sapanisertib in NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC patients at the selected dose, and/or a randomized study comparing sapanisertib vs. standard of care.
 Subsequent development in sqNSCLC could involve monotherapy and/or combinations with standard of care therapies in earlier lines of therapy within the biomarker defined populations. NRF2- and KEAP1-mutations have been detected across several tumor types at frequencies up to 27%, providing additional indications for development of sapanisertib as a monotherapy and in combination beyond sqNSCLC.
NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC presents a market opportunity for an indication with unmet medical need. SqNSCLC is expected to be a $4.5B market by 2026. Sapanisertib has therapeutic potential, having demonstrated single agent activity with durable responses in NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC, as well as a favorable safety profile for development as monotherapy and/or in combination with other agents. Sapanisertib has potential both as a first-in-class treatment for NRF2-mutated sqNSCLC patients, as well as for expansion into NRF2-mutant populations in other cancers.
 Synthetic Lethality Preclinical Pipeline
 Calithera continues to leverage its discovery engine to build a robust preclinical pipeline of synthetic lethality targets with a focus on paralog genes. Paralog pairs are homologous genes with overlapping cellular functions that when lost as a pair are lethal. Gene paralog pairs represent a promising class of synthetic lethal cancer targets. When a tumor cell loses one paralog, the cell is dependent on the second paralog to carry out an essential cellular process, since loss of both paralogs leads to tumor cell death.
 VPS4 Inhibitors
In March, we announced that the first data from our preclinical synthetic lethality pipeline was accepted for presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting, being held April 8-13, 2022. The accepted poster will detail Calithera’s discovery of a novel series of VPS4A inhibitors that are currently advancing through lead optimization. VPS4A and VPS4B are paralog ATPases essential for remodeling intracellular organelle membranes. Membrane remodeling is an essential cellular function and loss of function of both VPS4 paralogs is lethal to cells. The preclinical data demonstrate that VPS4A genetic inhibition in cell lines with loss of VPS4B preferentially showed profound death in cancer cells. Calithera researchers have confirmed VPS4A and VPS4B as synthetic lethal paralog pairs, defined as genes with overlapping functions that when lost as a pair, lead to cell death. Due to the proximity of VPS4B to neighboring tumor suppressor genes, both homozygous and heterozygous loss of VPS4B can occur in cancer cells, making them vulnerable to VPS4A inhibition. VPS4B is lost in a heterozygous fashion in the majority of CRC, PDAC, ovarian, esophageal and head and neck cancers and is deleted in large numbers of other tumor types. At AACR 2022, Calithera will report the discovery of a series of novel, small-molecule VPS4A inhibitors which have potential in the treatment of VPS4B-deleted tumors.
Arginase Inhibitor CB-280
 Our product candidate, CB-280, is a novel oral inhibitor of arginase being developed for the treatment of CF.
Arginase has been proposed to be critical in the pathophysiology of several non-oncology diseases, including CF. CF patients have a mutation in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator, or CFTR, making them particularly susceptible to progressive loss in lung function. Airway disease in CF has a complex pathophysiology and, despite recent advances in developing therapies for CF, there still remains an unmet need. CB-280 is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of arginase. Neutrophils accumulate in the lungs of CF patients and secrete arginase. Sputum from patients with CF has elevated arginase activity leading to diminished arginine levels. Reduced arginine is thought to exacerbate pulmonary disease in CF by impairing production of nitric oxide, leading to a diminished anti-microbial response and impaired airway function. It is known that airways of patients with CF have lower than normal nitric oxide, or NO, production, and lower NO levels directly correlate with worsened lung function and increased colonization with pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Research in CF patients has demonstrated that increasing arginine levels can increase the production of nitric oxide and improve lung function. In addition, published preclinical data also demonstrated that arginine-dependent NO-based signaling is associated with increased function of the CFTR.
We, along with our preclinical collaborators, have validated arginase inhibitors in mouse models of CF and showed that CB-280 significantly improved lung function and reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa colony-forming units in CFTR knockout mice infected

with Pseudomonas. We believe that arginase inhibition can lead to reduced infection and improved lung function in CF patients and that these data support the clinical development of CB-280 in CF.
In February 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 trial conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The first-in-human Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of oral CB-280 in healthy volunteers. A Phase 1b clinical study in CF patients was initiated in July 2020, evaluating multiple doses of CB-280 compared to placebo in 32 adult CF patients to determine a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, range for CB-280 in CF patients.
In November 2021, we presented interim data from the Phase 1b trial at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC). Data were presented on the first 24 subjects (18 treated with CB-280, 6 with placebo) participating in the ongoing, Phase 1b dose-escalation trial in adults with CF. Key eligibility criteria for patients included chronic lung infection and current treatment with a stable CF medication regimen including CFTR modulators. Each dose cohort consisted of eight subjects randomized 3:1 to CB-280 or placebo dosed twice daily for 14 days. At the completion of each dose cohort, unblinded data were reviewed by an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee convened by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
 Data were presented for 50mg BID, 100mg BID and 200mg BID dose levels. The study enrolled subjects with a broad spectrum of CFTR genotypes, including nonsense mutations. Notably, 91% of subjects were already on CFTR modulator therapy with Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) or Kalydeco® (ivacaftor). CB-280 had a well-tolerated safety profile across all three dose levels, and all 18 subjects receiving CB-280 completed treatment without treatment interruptions or premature discontinuations. CB-280 demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics with plasma exposure increasing proportionally with dose. Complete and continuous target inhibition in plasma was achieved at the 100 mg dose and above. CB-280 also demonstrated robust pharmacodynamic effects, with rapid and significant dose-proportional increases in plasma arginine, the key driver of NO production. Increased airway NO production was reflected by a trend showing an increase in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in subjects treated with CB-280. Sweat chloride, a marker of CFTR function, showed a trend towards decreasing in CB-280 treated subjects, in line with previously reported preclinical data showing that arginase inhibition enhances CFTR function in human bronchial epithelial cells. Together, these biomarker trends further substantiate the proposed mechanism of action as a rational approach to treating CF. Changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)were assessed as a safety endpoint. A pooled analysis of treatment vs. placebo showed a positive trend in FEV1 compared to placebo. Enrollment of cohort 4 (300mg BID) and analysis is complete. No new safety signals were seen and plasma arginine, FeNO and FEV1 showed trends consistent with previous cohorts. Evaluation of next steps is ongoing. We plan on publishing the Ph1b data in the future.
Under our collaboration agreement with Incyte, we retained the sole right to develop and commercialize CB-280 in specific non-oncology rare disease indications, including CF. Arginase is also thought to play an important pathophysiologic role in several other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases, primary pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and others.
In October 2020, we were awarded up to $2.4 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to support development of CB-280.
Immuno-Oncology Preclinical IL4I1 Inhibitor CB-668
 We have also identified CB-668, an investigational first-in-class, potent, orally administered IL4I1 inhibitor as a novel immuno-oncology approach to cancer. CB-668 is an inhibitor of the enzyme IL4I1, an enzyme that is expressed by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, metabolizes phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan to produce hydrogen peroxide, an inhibitor of T-cell function. In particular, IL4I1 can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenic acid and other metabolites that lead to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical data were presented at the 2020 SITC Annual Meeting. In syngeneic mouse models CB-668 exhibited immune mediated, single agent activity and augmented activity in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. IL4I1 expression has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes and expression is elevated in multiple tumor types including ovarian and B-cell tumors.

 Arginase Inhibitor INCB001158
 Immune surveillance is the process whereby the body identifies pathogens as well as abnormal cells that are either infected with viruses or have become cancerous. Upon recognition of foreign or abnormal cells, a number of immune processes are activated to allow the body to attack and clear cells. However, excessive or inappropriate activation of the immune system can have negative consequences such as autoimmune disease, inflammation, or maternal-fetal rejection. Compensatory mechanisms have evolved to control excessive inflammatory activity by dampening the immune stimulation. Cancerous cells that successfully evade immune surveillance do so, in part, by blocking or reducing immune-stimulatory and/or enhancing immune-inhibitory activities. Immuno-oncology therapies interfere with mechanisms that tumors have used to dampen the immune response.


Tumors have evolved a number of strategies to avoid recognition and destruction by the immune system. One key mechanism is through suppression of cytotoxic T-cells that would otherwise attack and kill the cancer cells. Arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic T-cells. Without arginine, tumor specific cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells fail to activate, proliferate, and mount an effective anti-tumor response.
 In response to tumor-secreted factors, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, and neutrophils accumulate in the tumor and secrete the enzyme arginase, resulting in depletion of arginine from the tumor microenvironment. Significant infiltration by arginase-expressing myeloid cells has been reported in many solid tumor types including lung cancer, colorectal, esophageal, bladder, head and neck, kidney cancer, and other tumor types. We have confirmed that arginase-expressing MDSCs are found by immunohistochemistry, or IHC, in a wide range of tumor types including non-small cell lung (both adenocarcinoma and squamous types), gastrointestinal cancers and bladder cancers. Arginase enzyme levels are elevated in the plasma of cancer patients across a wide range of malignancies. We believe that arginase inhibitors can promote an anti-tumor immune response by restoring arginine levels, thereby allowing activation of the body’s cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells.
 INCB001158, a potent and selective orally bioavailable arginase inhibitor was discovered by Calithera and is being developed by Incyte. INCB001158 entered clinical trials in September 2016 and is currently being tested in three ongoing clinical trials. The first Phase 1b/2 trial (NCT02903914) is designed to evaluate the safety and recommended Phase 2 dose of INCB001158 as a monotherapy and in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. Initial data from this study was reported as an oral presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) on September 28, 2019.
A second clinical trial (NCT03314935) designed to evaluate INCB001158 in combination with chemotherapy opened for enrollment in November 2017. The Phase 1/2 trial in patients with solid tumors (including metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, biliary tract cancer (BTC), gastroesophageal cancer, endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer), is evaluating INCB001158 administered orally twice daily with either FOLFOX, gemcitabine/cisplatin or paclitaxel. Primary endpoints include safety and objective response rate. Preliminary safety and efficacy data of INCB001158 plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancers was presented in a virtual poster session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium January 15-17, 2021.
 One additional Phase 1/2 trial is ongoing, evaluating the safety and anti-tumor activity of INCB001158 in combination with daratumumab compared to daratumumab alone in refractory multiple myeloma patients (NCT03837509). In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, with Incyte. Under the terms of the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, we granted Incyte an exclusive, worldwide license to co-develop and co-commercialize our small molecule arginase inhibitors for hematology and oncology indications. In September 2021, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with Incyte. Concurrently, the parties also filed a dismissal of the complaint we filed against Incyte for breach of contract in the Superior Court of California. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Release, which resolves all claims in the complaint without any admission of liability or fault, Incyte agreed to pay us a negotiated settlement amount of $6.75 million and the parties exchanged mutual releases. In September 2021, we received and recognized the $6.75 million as milestone revenues. Effective September 30, 2020, we opted out of our co-development obligations as permitted under the terms of the Incyte Collaboration Agreement. As a result of our decision to opt out, Incyte will pay all costs to develop INCB001158 or any other licensed products. Incyte will pay us tiered royalties ranging from the low double digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products and total remaining potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestones of $720.0 million.
 In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Arginase License Agreement, with Mars, Inc., by and through its Mars Symbioscience division, or Symbioscience, under which we have been granted the exclusive, worldwide license rights to develop and commercialize Symbioscience’s portfolio of arginase inhibitors for use in human healthcare. Under the Arginase License Agreement, we are responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of the licensed products at our cost, are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities, and must meet certain general diligence obligations. We hold the first right to prosecute and to enforce all licensed rights under the Arginase License Agreement throughout the world, and Symbioscience will retain certain step-in enforcement rights. Under the exclusivity provisions of the Arginase License Agreement, each party agrees not to develop any other arginase inhibitors for use in human healthcare outside of the scope of the Arginase License Agreement
 CD73 inhibitor CB-708 (now ATG-037)
 CD73 is an enzyme that produces adenosine, a powerful inhibitor of immune function in tumors. CD73 is expressed across a wide range of tumors and tumor infiltrating leukocytes, and often correlates with poor prognosis. Blockade of adenosine production by CD73 inhibition is expected to reverse immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and enhance the immune system’s ability to fight the cancer. We have developed an orally-bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73, CB-708, that has anti-tumor activity

in mouse syngeneic models both as monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors as well as chemotherapy. Preclinical data were presented at the 2019 AACR annual meeting in April and the SITC meeting in November demonstrating that CB-708 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CD73 that has immune-mediated, single agent activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models. In pre-clinical studies CB-708 was well-tolerated and shows enhanced antitumor activity when combined with either an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy or with chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin or doxorubicin. In May 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Antengene Investment Limited, or Antengene, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Antengene Corporation, where we granted Antengene an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize CB-708 (now ATG-037). Under the terms of the license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $3.0 million in May 2021 and may receive potential development, regulatory and sales milestone of up to $252.0 million. Additionally, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of licensed product up to low double-digits. In February 2022, Antengene announced approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) in Australia to initiate the Phase I STAMINA trial, a first-in-human study of ATG-037 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NCT05205109).
 Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, including CB-228 (sapanisertib), CB-659 (mivavotinib), INCB001158, CB-280, our preclinical compounds, and our core technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business strategy. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We file patent applications directed to our product candidates, preclinical compounds, and related technologies to establish intellectual property positions on these compounds and their uses in treating disease. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 23 issued U.S. patents, 150 issued foreign patents, and approximately 157 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications in the following foreign jurisdictions: Algeria, ARIPO, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Egypt, Europe, Georgia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between November 2025 and October 2041.
 Our dual TORC 1/2 inhibitor patent portfolio includes patents and applications owned by us and patents and applications exclusively licensed from The Regents of the University of California. As of December 31, 2021, it included nine issued U.S. patents. These patents claim compositions of matter for, methods of treating cancer with, and methods of synthesizing CB-228 and related compounds. They also claim methods of treating certain cancers using CB-228 at particular dosages, and methods of combining CB-228 with other compounds to treat certain cancers. In the U.S., the composition of matter patents are expected to expire between April 2027 and April 2031. We also have 63 issued foreign patents, three pending U.S. patent applications and five pending foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter for CB-228 and related compounds, as well as methods of using these compounds. We expect that the claims to composition of matter within these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between November 2025 and August 2032.
 Our SYK inhibitor intellectual property portfolio is wholly owned by us and as of December 31, 2021, included four issued U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications covering the composition for and methods of using CB-659 and related compounds. The U.S. patents relating to the composition of matter for CB-659 are expected to expire between March 2031 and April 2036. We also own 56 related foreign patents and 30 related foreign pending patent applications. We expect that these foreign patents and patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire between December 2030 and December 2035.
The intellectual property portfolio for our arginase inhibitor program, which includes INCB001158 and CB-280, includes issued patents and pending patent applications that we have exclusively licensed from Symbioscience as well as issued patents and pending patent applications that we own. This portfolio includes 20 issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, 113 corresponding pending foreign patent applications, and 85 issued foreign patents directed to various arginase inhibitors, therapeutic methods of using the compounds, methods of making the compounds, and intermediates useful in preparing the compounds. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between April 2031 and May 2038.
 Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture clinical supplies of mivavotinib and sapanisertib. Mivavotinib and sapanisertib are organic compounds of low molecular weight. Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing clinical supplies for use

in our clinical trials utilizing reliable and reproducible synthetic processes and common manufacturing techniques. We obtain our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term arrangements. In addition, we do not currently have arrangements in place for bulk drug substance or drug product services of any of our clinical supplies. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide bulk drug substance and drug product services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA if necessary to ensure sufficient commercial quantities of mivavotinib and sapanisertib. Incyte Corporation and Antengene Corporation have responsibility for manufacturing of INCB001158 and ATG-037 drug substance and drug product, respectively.
 Research and Development
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our primary competitors or product candidates in clinical development in either NRF2-mutated cancers, or with similar mechanism to an mTORC1/2 inhibitor are Antengene Corporation, AstraZeneca plc, and Celcuity, Inc. Our primary competitors or product candidates in clinical development for ABC or MyD88/CD79-mutated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are AstraZeneca, Curis, Inc., HutchMed (China) Limited, and Kymera Therapeutics. Potential competitors with a mechanism similar to a SYK inhibitor, or for relapsed/refractory DLBCL in general also include ADC Therapeutics SA, Genentech, Inc., Karyopharm Therapeutics, and MorphoSys AG. Our primary competitors in the field of Cystic Fibrosis include AbbVie, Inc., Beyond Air Inc., Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., Novartis AG, Novoteris, LLC, Proteostatis Therapeutics, Inc., Translate Bio, Inc., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted drug therapy, and immunotherapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Any product candidates we develop will compete with many existing drug and other therapies. To the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of therapeutics in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These therapeutics in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any product candidate for which we may obtain market approval.


Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved therapeutics than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of mivavotinib, sapanisertib, CB-280, INCB001158, ATG-037 and any future product candidates we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, synergy with other approved therapies, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our competitors may develop and commercialize therapeutics that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapeutics that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their therapeutics more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party and government programs seeking to control healthcare costs.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States Drug Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implements regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production or purchase of clinical supplies;
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 Preclinical Studies and IND
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical

studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review,

evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
 After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track Designation
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Priority Review
 Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for Priority Review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is accepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for Priority Review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA’s criteria for Priority Review.
Accelerated Approval
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely

to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 A sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for breakthrough therapy designation.
Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request), relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license application and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication where orphan designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Overview of FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 We may seek to develop in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. In August 2014, the FDA issued a guidance document that states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The guidance addresses issues critical to developing and obtaining approval or clearance for companion diagnostics and provides guidance as to when the FDA will require that the in vitro diagnostic, which is regulated as a

medical device, and the drug be approved simultaneously. The FDA requires in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval simultaneously with approval of the drug.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMs, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase four clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Additional U.S. Healthcare Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions,

the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute and false claims laws are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with this law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 We may also be subject to additional federal and state laws related to physician transparency, data privacy and security, and pharmaceutical manufacturer compliance guidelines, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 63 employees, all of which were full-time employees, including 23 employees with Ph.D., Pharm.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 41 employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
Facilities
We occupy approximately 34,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California. Our lease term is through January 2024, with an option to extend another two years to January 2026. We believe that our facility is sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
