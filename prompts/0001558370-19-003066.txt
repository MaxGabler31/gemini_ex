 ITEM 1  BUSINESS
 General
 Severn Bancorp and Subsidiaries (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a savings and loan holding company incorporated in the state of Maryland in 1990. The Company conducts business primarily through four subsidiaries, Severn Savings Bank, FSB (the “Bank”), Mid-Maryland Title Company, Inc. (“the Title Company”), SBI Mortgage Company (“SBI”), and the Bank’s principal subsidiary Louis Hyatt, Inc. (“Hyatt Commercial”), which conducts business as Hyatt Commercial. SBI is the parent company of Crownsville Development Corporation (“Crownsville”), which does business as Annapolis Equity Group.
 Hyatt Commercial is a real estate brokerage company specializing in commercial real estate sales, leasing, and property management.
 SBI engages in the origination of mortgages that do not meet the underwriting criteria of the Bank. It owns subsidiary companies that purchase real estate for investment purposes. As of December 31, 2018, SBI had $1.3 million in outstanding mortgage loans and it had $630,000 invested in subsidiaries, which funds were held in cash, pending potential acquisition of investment real estate.
 Crownsville, doing business as Annapolis Equity Group, is engaged in the business of acquiring real estate for investment and syndication purposes.
 HS West, LLC (“HS”) is a subsidiary of the Bank which constructed a building in Annapolis, Maryland that serves as the Company’s and the Bank’s administrative headquarters. A branch office of the Bank is also located in the building. In addition, HS leases space to four unrelated companies and to a law firm of which the President of the Company and the Bank is a partner.
 The Title Company engages in title work related to real estate transactions.
 Severn Financial Services Corporation is a subsidiary of the Bank that is part of a joint venture with a local insurance agency to provide various insurance products to customers of the Bank.
 The Bank has six branches in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which offer a full range of deposit products and originate mortgages in the Bank’s primary market of Anne Arundel County, Maryland and, to a lesser extent, in other parts of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated total assets of $974.2 million, total loans of $682.3 million, total deposits of $779.5 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $98.5 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $8.6 million. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 164 full-time equivalent employees.
 Acquisition
 On September 1, 2017, we acquired the Title Company by issuing common stock in a business combination. We issued 108,084 shares in the transaction valued at $775,000. We recorded $770,000 in goodwill in the transaction. The acquisition continues our growth strategy and focus on being a full-service provider of financial services and complements the mortgage services, commercial banking services, and commercial real estate services we provide.

 Business of the Bank
 The Bank was organized in 1946 in Baltimore, Maryland as Pompeii Permanent Building and Loan Association. It relocated to Annapolis, Maryland in 1980 and its name was changed to Severn Savings Association. Subsequently, the Bank obtained a federal charter and changed its name to Severn Savings Bank, FSB. The Bank operates six full-service branch offices and one administrative office, all in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The Bank operates as a federally chartered savings bank whose principal business is attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds in mortgage and commercial loans. The Bank also uses advances, or loans, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, (“FHLB”) to fund its lending activities. The Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services. Personal services include mortgage lending and various other lending services as well as checking, savings, money market, time deposit, and individual retirement accounts, as well as Internet and mobile banking. Commercial services include commercial secured and unsecured lending services as well as business Internet banking, corporate cash management services, and deposit services. The Bank also provides safe deposit boxes, ATMs, debit cards, credit cards, personal Internet banking including on-line bill pay, and telephone banking, among other products and services.
 Revenues are derived principally from interest earned on mortgage, commercial, and other loans, and fees charged in connection with the loans and banking services. The Bank’s primary sources of funds are deposits, advances from the FHLB, proceeds from loans sold on the secondary market, sales and maturities of securities, and repayments and principal prepayment of loans. The principal executive offices of the Bank are maintained at 200 Westgate Circle, Suite 200, Annapolis Maryland, 21401 and the telephone number is 410‑260‑2000.
 Medical-Use Cannabis Related Business
 In 2017, we began providing banking services to customers that are licensed by the state of Maryland to do business in the medical-use cannabis industry as growers, processors, and dispensaries. Medical-use cannabis businesses are legal in the State of Maryland. We maintain stringent written policies and procedures related to the on-boarding of such businesses and to the monitoring and maintenance of such business accounts.
 We do a deep upfront due diligence review of a medical-use cannabis business before the business is on-boarded, including a site visit and confirmation that the business is properly licensed by the state of Maryland. Throughout the relationship, we continue monitoring the business, including site visits, to ensure that the medical-use cannabis business continues to meet our stringent requirements, including maintenance of required licenses. We perform periodic financial reviews of the business and monitor the business in accordance with Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and State Commission requirements.
 Following is a summary of the level of business activities with our medical-use cannabis customers:

· | Deposit and loan balances at December 31, 2018 were approximately $17.0 million, or 2.2% of total deposits, and $14.1 million, or 2.1% of total loans, respectively. Deposit and loan balances at December 31, 2017 were approximately $19.2 million, or 3.2% of total deposits, and $11.9 million, or 1.8% of total loans, respectively.

  Our Lending Activities
 We originate loans of all types, including residential mortgage, commercial, commercial mortgage, home equity, residential construction, commercial construction, land, and residential lot loans.
 We originate residential mortgage loans that are to be held in our loan portfolio as well as loans that are intended for sale in the secondary market. Loans sold in the secondary market are primarily sold to investors with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship. These loans are made in conformity with standard government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) underwriting criteria required by the investors to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market and are approved either by the Bank’s underwriter or the correspondent’s underwriter. Loans considered for our portfolio with borrowers that have lending relationships up to $250,000 are approved by any member of the Officers Loan Committee, which includes the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), the Chief Credit Officer, and the Chief Lending Officer. Loans considered for our portfolio with balances from $250,000 to $2.0 million are approved by a majority vote of the Officers Loan Committee. Loans considered for our portfolio with borrowers that have lending relationships of $2.0 million or greater are approved by the Bank’s Directors Loan Committee. Meetings of the Directors Loan Committee are open to attendance by any member of the Bank’s Board of Directors who wishes to attend. The loan committee reports to and consults with the Board of Directors in interpreting and applying our lending policy. Single loans greater than $3.0 million, or loans to one borrower aggregating more than $5.0 million, up to $18.4 million (the maximum amount of loans to one borrower as of December 31, 2018), must also have approval of the Board of Directors.
 Loans that are sold into the secondary market are typically residential long-term loans (15 or more years), generally with fixed rates of interest. Loans retained for our portfolio typically include construction loans, commercial loans, and loans that periodically reprice or mature prior to the end of an amortized term. Generally, loans are sold with servicing released, however for loans sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), the servicing rights have been retained. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was servicing $29.4 million in loans for FNMA and $15.1 million in loans for FHLMC.
 Our lending activities are subject to written policies approved by our Board of Directors to ensure proper management of credit risk. We make loans that are subject to a well-defined credit process that includes credit evaluation of borrowers, risk-rating of credits, establishment of lending limits, and application of lending procedures, including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances, as well as procedures for on-going identification and management of credit deterioration. We conduct regular portfolio reviews to identify potential under-performing credits, estimate loss exposure, geographic and industry concentrations, and to ascertain compliance with our policies. For 

 
  3

 
significant problem loans, we review and evaluate the financial strengths of our borrower and the guarantor, the related collateral and the effects of economic conditions.
 We generally do not make loans to be held in our loan portfolio outside our market area unless the borrower has an established relationship with us and conducts its principal business operations within our market area. Consequently, we and our borrowers are affected by the economic conditions prevailing in our market area.
 Loan Approval Process
 Our loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. The authority of the Directors Loan Committee to approve loans is established by the Board of Directors and currently is commensurate with the limitation on loans to one borrower. Our maximum amount of loans to one borrower is equal to 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital, or $18.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Loans greater than this amount require participation by one or more additional lenders. We also maintain an in-house loans-to-one-borrower limit (lending relationship) of $10.0 million. Any loan greater than $10.0 million requires Board of Director approval. Letters of credit are subject to the same limitations as direct loans. For real estate collateral, we utilize independent qualified appraisers approved by management to appraise the collateral securing the loan and require title insurance or title opinions so as to ensure that we have a valid lien on the collateral. We require borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on secured real estate.
 The procedure for approval of construction loans is the same as above, except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans, construction specifications, and estimates of construction costs as well. The Bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer.
 Consumer loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s credit history and an analysis of the borrower’s income and expenses, ability to repay the loan, and the value of the collateral, if any.
 Residential Mortgage Loans
 At December 31, 2018, our residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled $274.8 million, or 40.3% of our loan portfolio. All of our residential mortgage loans are secured by one-to-four family residential properties and are primarily located in the Bank’s market area. Commercial Loans
 The Bank offers other business and commercial loans. These are loans to businesses and are typically lines of credit or other loans that , in general, are not secured by real estate. If not secured by real estate, they are usually secured by business assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, securities, or other collateral. At December 31, 2018, $35.9 million, or 5.2% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.
 Commercial loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Because payments on commercial loans secured by business assets or other collateral are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the commercial enterprise, repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans
 At December 31, 2018, our commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $242.7 million, or 35.6% of our loan portfolio. All of our commercial real estate loans are secured by improved property such as office buildings, retail strip shopping centers, industrial condominium units, and other small businesses, most of which are located in the Bank’s primary lending area.
 Loans secured by commercial real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful 

 
  4

 
operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.
 Construction, Land Acquisition, and Development Loans (“ADC”)
 We originate loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family dwellings, and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate. We also originate loans for the acquisition and development of unimproved property to be used for residential and/or commercial purposes, generally in cases where the Bank is to provide the construction funds to improve the properties. As of December 31, 2018, we had ADC loans outstanding in the amount of $114.5 million, or 16.8% of our loan portfolio.
 Construction loan amounts are based on the appraised value of the property. Construction loans generally have terms of up to one year, with reasonable extensions as needed, and typically have interest rates that float monthly at margins ranging from the prime rate to 200 basis points above the prime rate. In addition to builders’ projects, we finance the construction of single-family, owner-occupied homes where qualified contractors are involved and on the basis of strict written underwriting and construction loan guidelines. Construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans with the Bank upon the expiration of the construction phase or to be paid off by financing from another financial institution.
 Construction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on loans secured by existing residential properties. These higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending. Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction that is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to value accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio (“LTV”). As a result, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the ultimate success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion, due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time. We have attempted to address these risks through our underwriting procedures and our limited amount of construction lending on multi-family and commercial real estate properties.
 It is our policy to obtain third-party physical inspections of each property secured by a construction or rehabilitation loan for the purpose of reporting upon the progress of the project. These inspections, referred to as “construction draw inspections,” are to be performed at the time of a request for an advance of construction funds.
 Home Equity and Other Consumer Loans
 We offer various consumer loans including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and other personal loans. At December 31, 2018, $14.5 million, or 2.1% of our loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans.  The majority of consumer loans are home equity lines of credit. Our Deposit Activities
 Subject to the Company’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) policies and current business plan, the Treasury function (see information on Treasury activities below) works closely with the Company’s retail deposit operations to accomplish the objectives of maintaining deposit market share within the Company’s primary markets and managing funding costs to preserve the net interest margin.
 One of the Company’s primary objectives as a community bank is to develop long-term, multi-product customer relationships from its comprehensive menu of financial products, which include both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (“CDs”). To that end, the 

 
  5

 
lead product to develop such relationships is typically a deposit product. The Company intends to rely on deposit growth to fund long-term loan growth. 
 Core deposits are deposits that provide stable funding sources and are generally not reactive to changes in the interest rate environment.  We consider all deposits, except CDs of $100,000 or more to be core deposits. Our experience has been that a substantial portion of CDs renew at time of maturity and remain on deposit with the Bank.  Core deposits amounted to $635.8 million, or 81.6% of total deposits, and $452.1 million, or 75.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Our Treasury Activities
 The Treasury function manages the wholesale segments of the balance sheet, including investments, purchased funds and long-term debt, and is responsible for all facets of interest rate risk management for the Company, which includes the pricing of deposits consistent with conservative interest rate risk and liquidity practices. Management’s objective is to achieve the maximum level of consistent earnings over the long term, while minimizing interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk and optimizing capital utilization. In managing the investment portfolio under its stated objectives, we invest primarily in United States of America (“U.S.”) Treasury and Agency securities, U.S Agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), and U.S. Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (“CMO”). Treasury strategies and activities are overseen by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, ALCO and the Company’s Investment Committee, which reviews all investment and funding transactions. The ALCO activities are summarized and reviewed quarterly with the Company’s Board of Directors.
 The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to provide the necessary liquidity consistent with anticipated levels of deposit funding and loan demand with a minimal level of risk. The overall average life of 2.4 years of the investment portfolio together with the types of investments is intended to provide sufficient cash flows to support the Company’s lending goals. Liquidity is also provided by lines of credit maintained with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve (“FRB”), and to a lesser extent, lines of credit from other banks.
 Our Borrowing Activities
 Management utilizes a variety of sources to raise borrowed funds at competitive rates, including federal funds purchased, FHLB borrowings, and retail repurchase agreements. FHLB borrowings typically carry rates at varying spreads from the LIBOR rate or treasury yield curve for the equivalent term because they may be secured with investments or high quality loans. Federal funds purchased, which are generally overnight borrowings, are typically purchased at the FRB target rate.
 The Company’s borrowing activities are achieved through the use of the previously mentioned lines of credit to address overnight and short-term funding needs, match-fund loan activity and, when opportunities are present, to lock in attractive rates due to market conditions.
 Competition
 The Annapolis, Maryland area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Bank, and all of which are competitors of the Bank to varying degrees. Competition for loans comes primarily from savings and loan associations, savings banks, mortgage-banking companies, insurance companies, commercial banks, and Internet-based financial institutions. Many of our competitors have higher legal lending limits than we do. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks, and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds. We also face increased competition for deposits from other financial institutions such as brokerage firms, insurance companies, and mutual funds, as well as Internet-based financial institutions. We are a community-oriented financial institution serving our market area with a wide selection of mortgage loans and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Management considers the Bank’s reputation for financial strength and customer service as its major competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers in our market area. We also believe we benefit from our community engagement activities.

 Market Area
 Our market area is primarily Anne Arundel County, Maryland and nearby areas, and our six branch locations are all located in Anne Arundel County. Anne Arundel county maintains a diverse set of economic drivers such as a large international airport, the defense industry, a large number of large private sector employers as well as telecommunications, retail, and distribution operations.  The population of Anne Arundel County has been growing steadily since 2000 and is projected to continue such growth through 2020. The largest population demographic of Anne Arundel County is in the 20-44 age category.
 We continue to expand our business relationship banking program by focusing on the needs of the business community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. We focus our lending activities primarily on first mortgage loans secured by real estate for the purpose of purchasing, refinancing, developing, and constructing one-to-four family residences and commercial properties in and near Anne Arundel County, Maryland. We strive to offer competitive deposit and loan products that fit the needs of the Anne Arundel County community.  Our desire is to be a one-stop shop for all of the community’s banking needs.
 Supervision and Regulation
 The Company and its subsidiaries operate in an industry that is subject to laws and regulations that are enforced by a number of federal and state agencies. Changes in these laws and regulations, including interpretation and enforcement activities, could impact the cost of operating in the financial services industry, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect competition among banks and other financial institutions.
 Regulation of the Company
 General
 We are a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”). As such, we are registered with the FRB and are subject to regulations, examinations, supervision, and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over us and any nonsavings bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
 As a unitary savings and loan holding company, we generally are not subject to activity restrictions, provided the Bank satisfies the Qualified Thrift Lender (“QTL”) test (see “Qualified Thrift Lender Test” under “Regulation of the Bank” below). If the Bank failed to meet the QTL test, then we would become subject to the activities restrictions applicable to multiple savings and loan holding companies and, unless the Bank qualifies as a QTL within one year thereafter, we would be required to register as, and would become subject to the restrictions applicable to, a bank holding company. Additionally, if we acquired control of another savings institution, other than in a supervisory acquisition where the acquired institution also met the QTL test, we would thereupon become a multiple savings and loan holding company and thereafter be subject to further restrictions on our activities. We currently intend to continue to operate as a unitary savings and loan holding company.
 Regulatory Capital Requirements
 Under capital regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies became subject to additional regulatory capital requirements. However, in May 2015, amendments to the FRB’s small bank holding company policy statement (the “SBHC Policy”) became effective. The amendments made the SBHC Policy applicable to savings and loan holding companies such as us and increased the asset threshold to qualify to be subject to the provisions of the SBHC Policy from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion. In August, 2018, the SBHC Policy was increased to $3.0 billion in assets.  Savings and loan holding companies that have total assets of $3.0 billion or less are subject to the SBHC Policy and are not required to comply with the additional regulatory capital requirements provided that such holding company (i) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) does not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or 

 
  7

 
through a nonbank subsidiary; and (iii) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the SEC. The FRB may in its discretion exclude any savings and loan holding company, regardless of asset size, from the SBHC Policy if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes. The exemption continues until our total assets exceed $3.0 billion, we do not meet the other requirements discussed above, or the FRB deems it to be warranted for supervisory purposes.
 Restrictions on Acquisitions
 Except under limited circumstances, savings and loan holding companies, such as us, are prohibited from (i) acquiring, without approval of the FRB, control of a savings institution or a savings and loan holding company or all or substantially all of the assets of any such institution or holding company; (ii) acquiring, without prior approval of the FRB, more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings institution or a holding company which is not a subsidiary thereof; or (iii) acquiring control of an uninsured institution, or retaining, for more than one year after the date of any savings institution becomes uninsured, control of such institution. In evaluating proposed acquisitions of savings institutions by holding companies, the FRB considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the holding company and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) fund, the convenience and the needs of the community, and competitive factors.
 No director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than 25% of such company’s stock, may acquire control of any savings institution, other than a subsidiary savings institution, or of any other savings and loan holding company, without written approval of the FRB. 
 The FRB is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 Federal Securities Law
 The Company’s securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As such, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, and other requirements and restrictions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) established a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures intended to increase corporate responsibility and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. The Company is subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because it is required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and related NASDAQ Stock Market rules have established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for the Company’s audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between the Company and its outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services the auditors may provide to the Company), imposed additional financial statement certification responsibilities for the Company’s CEO and CFO, expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders, required management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting, and required the Company’s auditors to issue a report on its internal control over financial reporting.
 Financial Services Modernization Legislation
 In November 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) was enacted. The GLBA generally permits banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies, and securities firms to enter into combinations that result in a single financial services organization to offer customers a wider array of financial services and products provided that they do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general.

 GLBA resulted in increased competition for the Company and the Bank from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products, many of which may have substantially more financial resources than we do.
 Maryland Corporation Law
 We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland, and are therefore subject to regulation by the state of Maryland. The rights of our stockholders are governed by the Maryland General Corporation Law. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”)
 The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. Among other things, the new law (i) establishes a new, flat corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21%; (ii) eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows the use of any such carryforwards to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year; (iii) limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by U.S. corporations; (iv) allows businesses to immediately expense, for tax purposes, the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets; (v) eliminates or reduces certain deductions related to meals and entertainment expenses; (vi) modifies the limitation on excessive employee remuneration to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation and clarifies the definition of a covered employee; and (vii) limits the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums. The Tax Act also significantly changes U.S. tax law related to foreign operations, however, such changes do not currently impact us. 
 Regulation of the Bank
 General
 As a federally chartered, FDIC insured savings institution, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and secondarily, by the FDIC. Lending activities and other investments of the Bank must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the FRB. The OCC regularly examines the Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of the Bank’s Board of Directors on the operations of the Bank. The relationship between the Bank and depositors and borrowers is also regulated by federal and state laws, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents utilized by the Bank.
 The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions.
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018
 On May 24, 2018, The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The Regulatory Relief Act’s provisions include, among other things: (i) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not requiring appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempting banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act’s (“HMDA”) expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarifying that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; (v) raising eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; (vi) allowing qualifying federal savings banks to elect to operate with National Bank powers; and (vii) simplifying capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status.

 Regulatory Capital Requirements
 Federal regulations require all FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; a Tier 1 capital to total risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to total risk-based assets ratio of 8%, a leverage ratio of 4%, and a tangible capital, measured as core capital (Tier 1 capital), to average total assets ratio of 1.5%.
 Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock and related surplus, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive gain/loss, and, subject to certain adjustments, minority common equity interests in subsidiaries, reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets (other than certain mortgage servicing assets), net of associated deferred tax liabilities.
 Tier 1 capital consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Under the amendments, cumulative preferred stock no longer qualifies as additional Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities and other nonqualifying capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank and savings and loan holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 or by mutual holding companies may continue to be included in Tier 1 capital but will be phased out over 10 years beginning in 2016 for all other banking organizations.
 Total Capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt.
 Tangible Capital means the amount of core capital (Tier 1 capital), plus the amount of outstanding perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) not included in Tier 1 capital.
 Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests) are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first-lien residential mortgage loans, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to first-lien residential mortgage loans not qualifying under the prudently underwritten standards as well as commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans, a risk weight of 250% is assigned to certain mortgage serving rights (“MSRs”), and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 In addition to higher capital requirements, the amended regulations provide that depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases or for the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital conservation buffer requirement has been phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and 10.5% total capital on a fully phased-in basis.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the OCC proposed a rule that establishes a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average total assets) at 9% for institutions under $10 billion in assets that such institutions may elect to utilize in lieu of the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III.  Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be 

 
  10

 
deemed to be well-capitalized.  Until the OCC’s proposed rule is finalized, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect.  
 In addition to requiring institutions to meet the applicable capital standards for savings institutions, the OCC may require institutions to meet capital standards in excess of the prescribed standards as the OCC determines necessary or appropriate for such institution in light of the particular circumstances of the institution. Such circumstances would include a high degree of exposure to interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and certain risks arising from nontraditional activity. The OCC may treat the failure of any savings institution to maintain capital at or above such level as an unsafe or unsound practice and may issue a directive requiring any savings institution which fails to maintain capital at or above the minimum level required by the OCC to submit and adhere to a plan for increasing capital.
 Enforcement
 The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against the institution and all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers, and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement actions by the OCC may range from issuance of a capital directive or a cease and desist order, to removal of officers or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specific circumstances. Safety and Soundness Standards
 Federal law requires each federal banking agency, including the OCC, to prescribe to certain standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees, and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines further provide that savings institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees, and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss, and should take into account factors such as comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions. If the OCC determines that a savings institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines, it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines. A savings institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to the OCC within 30 days of receipt of a request for such a plan. If the institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, the OCC must issue an order directing the institution to correct the deficiency. Failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. Prompt Corrective Action
 Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions.  For this purpose, a savings institution is placed into one of the following five categories dependent on their respective capital ratios:
· | An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  11

 


· | An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As noted above, the Regulatory Relief Act has eliminated the Basel III requirements for banks with less than $10.0 billion in assets who elect to follow the community bank leverage ratio once the OCC’s rule is finalized. The OCC’s proposed rule provides that the Bank will be well-capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 9% or greater, adequately capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5% or greater, undercapitalized if the Bank’s community bank leverage ratio is less than 7.5% and greater than 6% and significantly undercapitalized if the Bank’s community bank leverage ratio is less than 6%. The definition of critically undercapitalized is unchanged from the current regulations.
 Generally, the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) requires the OCC to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution within 90 days of that institution becoming “critically undercapitalized.” The regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days after an institution receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution, including, but not limited to, restrictions on growth, investment activities, payment of dividends and other capital distributions, and affiliate transactions. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against the undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and, in the case of an institution that fails to file a required capital restoration plan, the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the capital requirements of a “well capitalized” institution under applicable OCC regulations.
 Premiums for Deposit Insurance
 The deposits of the Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, generally up to $250,000 per insured depositor. The Bank pays deposit insurance premiums based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The FDIC has established a risk-based assessment system under which institutions are classified and pay premiums according to their perceived risk to the DIF. An institution’s base assessment rate is generally subject to the following adjustments: (1) a decrease for the institution’s long-term unsecured debt, including most senior and subordinated debt; (2) an increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount; and (3) an increase for unsecured debt held that is issued by another insured depository institution.
 On April 1, 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total domestic deposits to average total assets, minus average tangible equity. In addition, the FDIC also created a two scorecard system, one for large depository institutions that have $10.0 billion or more in assets and another for highly complex institutions that have $50.0 billion or more in assets.
 Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company, such as us, if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the DIF, although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the DIF.
 The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order, or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. Additionally, the FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank or an increase in the Bank’s insurance assessments could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

 Privacy
 The Bank is subject to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records. Additionally, GLBA places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Pursuant to GLBA and rules adopted thereunder, financial institutions must provide an initial notice to customers about their privacy policies, describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates.
 Since GLBA’s enactment, a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws. The Bank has implemented its privacy policies in accordance with all applicable laws.
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test
 Savings institutions must meet a QTL test, which may be met either by maintaining, on average, at least 65% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments in at least nine of the most recent twelve month period, or meeting the definition of a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Code. “Portfolio Assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) goodwill and other intangible assets; and (iii) the value of property used in the conduct of the savings institution’s business. Qualified thrift investments are primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage‑related securities. Institutions that fail to meet the QTL test are subject to OCC enforcement action for a violation of law. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with its QTL requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan institution. Affiliate Transactions
 Transactions between savings institutions and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings institutions by Section 11 of the HOLA. A savings institution affiliate includes any company or entity which controls the savings institution or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings institution. For example, the holding company of a savings institution and any companies which are controlled by such holding company, are affiliates of the savings institution. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings institution or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, as well as contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions,” as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings institution as those provided to a nonaffiliate. “Covered transaction” include the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings institution to an affiliate. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, Section 11 of HOLA prohibits a savings institution from (i) making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate, except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings institution.
 The Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors, trustees, and 10% stockholders, as well as entities under such person’s control, is currently governed by Section 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these regulations generally require such loans to be made on terms substantially similar to those offered to unaffiliated individuals, place limits on the amounts of the loans the Bank may make to such persons based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position, and require certain board of directors’ approval procedures to be followed.
 Capital Distribution Limitations
 OCC regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings institutions, such as cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger, and other distributions charged against capital.

 
  13

 

 The OCC regulations require a savings institution to file an application for approval of a capital distribution if:

· | the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings with the OCC;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the total amount of all of capital distributions, including the proposed capital distribution, for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized, as determined under the capital requirements described above under “Prompt Corrective Action,” following the distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, or regulatory agreement or condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, a savings institution must give the OCC notice of a capital distribution if the savings institution is not required to file an application, but:

· | would not be well capitalized, as determined under the capital requirements described above under “Prompt Corrective Action,” following the distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of the savings institution’s common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments such as notes or debentures included in capital, other than regular payments required under a debt instrument; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the savings institution is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, is filing a notice of the distribution with the FRB and is not otherwise required to file an application or notice regarding the proposed distribution with the OCC, in which case an information copy of the notice filed by the holding company with the FRB needs to be simultaneously provided to the OCC.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Further, any savings institution subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, also must file a notice with the FRB of any proposed dividend or distribution.
 The application or notice, as applicable, must be filed with the regulators at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution by its board of directors.
 The OCC or FRB may prohibit a proposed dividend or capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted if it determines that:

· | following the distribution, the savings institution will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, as determined under the capital requirements described above under “Prompt Corrective Action;”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed distribution raises safety or soundness concerns; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, or regulatory agreement or condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, as noted above, beginning in 2016, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer under the amended capital rules, its ability to pay dividends to the Company may be limited.  See “Regulation of the Bank - Prompt Corrective Action” above for additional information on the capital conservation buffer.
 Branching
 Under OCC branching regulations, the Bank is generally authorized to open branches in any state of the U.S. (i) if the Bank qualifies as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Code, which qualification requirements are similar to those for a QTL under HOLA or (ii) if the law of the state in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the savings institution were a state savings institution chartered by such state. The OCC authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings banks.

 Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and the Fair Lending Laws
 Federal savings banks have a responsibility under the CRA and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibits lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications. In addition, an institution’s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in the OCC, other federal regulatory agencies, as well as the Department of Justice, taking enforcement actions. We received a satisfactory rating from our most recent examination.
 FHLB System
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB.
 Under the capital plan of the FHLB, as of December 31, 2018, the Bank was required to own at least $3.7 million of the capital stock of the FHLB. As of such date, we were in compliance with the capital plan requirements.
 Federal Reserve System
 The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest-bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (primarily checking, NOW, and Super NOW checking accounts) and nonpersonal time deposits. For transaction accounts, the first $15.5 million is exempt from reserve requirements. A 3% reserve ratio is assessed on transaction accounts over $15.5 million up to and including $115.1 million. A 10% reserve ratio is assessed on transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the reserve requirements. 
 Effective January 1, 2019, the $15.5 million exemption will increase to $16.3 million. The 3% reserve ratio will be assessed on transactions over $16.3 million up to $124.2 million. Any transactions that exceed $124.2 million will be assessed $3.2 million plus 10% of the amount over $124.2 million. Nonpersonal time deposits will have a 0% reserve.
 Activities of Subsidiaries
 A federal savings bank seeking to establish a new subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company, or conduct a new activity through an existing subsidiary must provide 30 days prior notice to the OCC and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in compliance with regulations and orders of the OCC. The OCC has the power to require a savings institution to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OCC determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of the savings institution or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices. Tying Arrangements
 Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. U.S. Patriot Act (“Patriot Act”)
 Anti-terrorism legislation enacted under the Patriot Act of 2001 expanded the scope of anti-money laundering laws and regulations and imposed significant new compliance obligations for financial institutions, including the Bank. The Patriot Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the BSA, Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing 

 
  15

 
among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, these regulations impose affirmative obligations on a wide range of financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
 Other Regulations
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:
· | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one-to-four family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing, and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HMDA, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws that affect our consumer loan transactions. These include regulations setting “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage” standards for residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing and originator compensation standards.
